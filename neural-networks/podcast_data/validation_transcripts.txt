Episode 13. He's not the man. I thought he was.  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dreams. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self awareness along the way.  Hello ladies, welcome back to the first year married podcast. Thank you again so much for tuning in. I've been hearing it from a lot of you with variations on a theme. So I really wanted to take this week's podcast and address it and try and offer something to you that I think will be very very helpful. Now, even if you aren't coming at this from necessarily as difficult as situation as what I'm going to describe I  These tools will still be helpful. So I would suggest tuning in. Of course. It's my podcast. I'm going to suggest that but okay. So basically I'm hearing from women who are feeling frustrated disappointed disenchanted. They dated for a while before they got married or even if they didn't date for so long. Some of them are saying, you know, I went to premarital counseling we discussed all these things. I thought I knew what I was getting into right? I dated him for a long time. I  Knew who he was it's not turning out the way that I thought it would he's not the guy that I thought he was so I've got this sort of group of women who are coming to me with this this thought right that he just it's either the marriage or the guy it's just not turning out like like she thought like she expected. So I think this comes from a lot of different things and I wanted to go through them because I think there are some stumbling blocks here that we all fall into at different stages.  And you know at different points in our marriage we go through different feelings. Right and I talked a lot about that emotional bank account that early on one of the hardest things is that when you suffer disappointment, you just haven't log that many hours together and that many experience experiences and you know, when you go through disappointments together you go through struggles together at that logs all of this, you know, it's like logging money into your bank account, right? It's like this emotional savings account and when when negative things happen,  They don't hit you as hard later on but in the beginning, it's still new you don't really have that so these things can be a lot harder early on. So one of the things that I thought would be helpful to talk about is this classic situation early in marriage that we're trying to understand what seems new or foreign, right? So again, even if you've been dating for a while things often change right when you get married we try and put things into boxes. We try and wrap our heads around things.  Give them labels to kind of confine our husband into this box that can be handled and expected. You know, you can expect how he's going to behave and it just feels a lot more manageable. And in the beginning the truth is it can be really helpful right understanding, you know what my husband is an introvert. And so maybe when I'm really extraverted, so if I need a lot of social time, maybe I don't need to ask him to always be there with me because I understand now that he's an introvert and I'm an extrovert or you know, I'm very tired.  Taipei and he's very tight be so if I really care about getting to dinner on time, I'll make the reservations later or I'll give him more of a heads up right or you know, he's very very concerned about finances. So we're going to you know, I'm going to investigate cheaper date options, or maybe we'll stay in more often, right so we create these labels or we you know, do these personality tests. We do all these different things to sort of try and get a handle on this huge change in our lives and at first  When it's helping us gain an understanding when it's helping us see another dimension of who he is. Even if it's just one tiny Dimension and of course all of these are prone to contradiction because the end of the day, we're all human it can help write it gives us that feeling of security of I can expect what's coming understanding each other on a deeper way.  But what can also happen is it can very quickly turn into resentment and frustration? Okay. So my husband is very budget-conscious can turn into my husband is so stingy or my type B husband is always late and you hear this right? You really hear, you know, my husband always interrupts me my husband, you know, you can't take a you can't take him out these tags that were using to understand him in the first place become the title that we use to condemn him later on.  So I want you to try a take a deep piece of paper. If you're not driving and write out. My husband is so dot dot dot and then make a list of what comes out pause the podcast if you're able to do it now, otherwise do it later probably you'll find that some good things and some bad things come out but everything you're putting down on that paper is ultimately just a thought but you're having about your husband and anytime that we have a thought about something whether  Another person or ourselves or a situation or your weight or the money that you have in the bank you're going to go and find a lot of evidence that your thought is correct, of course participant from my first year married online program reached out to me and she said oh it's like the self-fulfilling prophecy. Right? Like I see a lot of overlap there, but the truth is it's so much more than that. I'm sure you've heard at least some study about the effect of expectation on teachers. They've done so  real studies one that I wanted to share with you, especially if any of you haven't heard of these studies is an original one Harvard Professor named Robert Rosenthal altered an IQ test so he gave the correct test but he gave it a very fancy sounding name and he gave it out to the teachers and of you know, the IQ test of all the teachers students and then he randomly chose certain students and he reported to the teacher that this fancy IQ test that they had all just taken  Go to that, you know these four or however many students were on the verge of a massive intellectual breakthrough. Okay, and as we know now because we've had several of these studies but this was an early one those students when they actually tested them their IQ had increased, you know several. I don't know if several months later their IQ had increased more than disproportionately more than the other students in the class.  And the only thing that was changed was the teachers expectation.  So he went back into the classroom to analyze what was actually different the teacher was not told to teach the students differently to give them different activities anything like that and what he found was it wasn't anything bait it big it was these teeny tiny little differences the way that the students were spoken to the amount of time. They were given when they asked a question how much they were smiled at even how much more they were just touched by the teacher all these totally  Subconscious and very likely unbeknownst to the teacher him or herself. All of these things were sending a message that great things were expected of that child. So women come to me often with a lot of frustration over their husbands or resentment. This is not the guy I thought I married but let's break that down when you think to yourself. This is not the man. I thought I married. So how do you feel for a lot of women they feel disappointed? And how do you act in a relationship with  One of whom you are disappointed how many of those tiny actions that Robert Rosenthal discovered are happening in your day-to-day life. And do you think he doesn't see it even if he doesn't pick up on a consciously, so maybe you start turning into yourself starting to find ways to keep yourself happy because you can't expect it from him or maybe you're less interested in his daily life because after all it's not the life that you expected and it's kind of a disappointment. So how much do you really need to know about it?  The result is a deflated man, and I'm not saying that you're controlling him on a high level. He's gonna do what he's gonna do and I of course as always if your husband is abusive. And anyway, we are not ever to take responsibility. It is not because of your thoughts or wrong don't misunderstand. But if you take any two normal healthy people and as that study showed we do affect each other. So can we control each other? No, I don't think so. But do we affect each other? Absolutely if your mother was always disappointed in  I know some of you just tuned in now you probably perform differently as a child than if she had raised you thinking that you are God's gift to humanity. Right? So look at your results, whether your behavior affects him and he's now less motivated and less likely to succeed or you're so busy and your disappointment. You don't have a moment to notice where he is providing and how he is excelling the results at the end of the day is you gather lots of evidence that you were right to be disappointed in him.  So I want to offer you instead of thought that I absolutely love.  You're married and you think to yourself being married is like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, you know, those novels that they used to have. I don't know if they still have them wear like it's a kids book and you know, you read the beginning of it and then you get to choose which chapter you want to go to like is Shelly going to go into the cave or not. And you open up to that chapter. It's like that's my thought. Okay. I know the basic Foundation of my husband. I know the author so to speak right but where is this going? Who's he evolving into no idea?  We're coming up on our 10-year anniversary and in so many ways he is so different from the man I married and I think that's great because that gives me room to evolve and change to we didn't make any guarantees in that area that we would stay the same. It would keep the same personalities, right? I expect surprise and delight and maybe even some frustration and heartache but I can handle that. I can handle hard feelings like that. That's a coaching is all about  So you think to yourself this line? I love and how fascinating. All right, that's what he he uses a lot. So he does something that isn't what you expected. It's not what you thought you signed up for and instead of this is not the man that I thought. I married you think to yourself how fascinating  And so how do you feel curious playful interested? I think also respectful because if you're fascinated there must be something to him that is Meaningful or deep and worth exploring. And so you might start asking him questions or even just watch him with this era of I wonder what's behind all this which makes him feel like you trust that there's logic you'll start to notice so much that you never even saw before he might even start to grow into the space that you're leaving for him.  But even if he doesn't change one iota, I promise you there's something that you're missing there something in him to discover.  And When the Thought changes to allow for that you will start to discover it.  When I first started studying the work of Alison Armstrong two pieces of information totally rocked my world there was definitely more than that. And you know, I got I'm sure you'll keep hearing more about it here in this podcast. There's tons of it in my course, but the ones that I feel like I use now on a daily basis are one that men were inherently providers.  And they're not always providing the thing that you want. But if you just look to see what it is that they're trying to provide you'll find it and the other one very practical one is that women are constantly interrupting men. And so what happens is that we never get to hear their complete thought which is why a lot of women think men are very shallow. Right when I learned this information. I was so fascinated with it and I was so, you know, like on a high from this total paradigm shift, so we used to have this  Man who you know, he wasn't in his retirement retirement age. He was working for our you know, exterminator company. So he would come around seasonally to spray the house and just learn this information. So he comes in and I decided to try and pay attention to if he was trying to provide anything. That was very clear. He had an expertise and he was trying to help me not have bugs in the house. It was it was very literal to his job in that case. I decided to let him finish any thoughts that he was  sharing with me  I approached him not even trying intentionally to show him respect or show him anything just to the feeling of curiosity of let me just hear him out. Whatever it is that he has to say and I will never forget that afternoon because this person who had sort of always seemed like this, you know bumbling retiree who was trying to help out.  You know by the end of the conversation had opened up about all of his wisdom that he learned as a father and his relationship with his daughter and there was so so so many dimensions that he shared with me and it really made me see in real time. How what she says about how we constantly interrupt is really true.  So all that to say that the way that we're approaching the relationship the way that we're approaching our daily life the way we're approaching our conversations. The thought that is behind it. You will find evidence one of the easiest ways of dealing with this is simply to flip the thought it could be this is not the man. I thought I married you could start exercising the thought for a couple minutes a day. This is exactly the man. I thought I married and then your  Is going to fill in all the really fundamental things that are exactly what you wanted when you married him, right? You could also flip the thought to this is not the man. I thought I married and this is wonderful. Just tag on a positive right because your initial thought really is this is not the man. I thought I married and that's a tragedy or that's terrible. So if you just add on an ending that switches it to a positive, right? This is a whole new man than I even thought I had right.  So again, your brain is going to go out and find evidence.  So I want to offer to you a challenge for this week. I love giving homework, which is to really do that exercise pay attention to what the thoughts are that you have filled in about your husband and most importantly don't beat yourself up about this if you haven't been doing thought work before so you can't expect your brain to always go to the most altruistic and the most helpful thought it's just not the way that were wired. It's not also the message that were necessarily getting from the  Around us. So cut yourself some slack. You're prone to beating yourself up, but take an honest look at some of the thoughts positive and negative that you have in your mind about your husband. And then I want to challenge you in the moment. If you're feeling frustrated to try and figure out what the thought is going on behind that and see if you can flip it or see if there's another one that you feel is equally true. You can take thought how fascinating and apply that whenever something goes unusually.  Not the way you expected.  I would love to have you share this information with your friends. If you know anybody who you think would appreciate this podcast, please take a screenshot share it with them or even share it on social media and you can tag me a first-year married more importantly. I have a email list where I send out an email every week. It's also the first place where anyone gets any announcements about new programs or anything else that were Brewing up over here at first he remarried so the way to get on that is to go to first year married.com.  And you'll also get access to my free class right there, which is called your husband isn't the reason you're unhappy and from there. You'll also get added on to the email list. So I look forward to seeing you over there and hearing from you over on Instagram. Have a fantastic week. Bye.
Today is Sunday, January 5th 2020 on this day in 1996 Hamas bomb-maker. Yehia. A Yash was assassinated by Shin Bet Israel's internal intelligence agency. The man who became famous for creating hidden bombs was undone by a hidden bomb himself.  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original today. We're covering the death of twenty nine-year-old. Yahia. A Yash by Israel's Shin Bet. Let's go back to the morning of January 5th 1996 as Israeli intelligence waits for the sleeping ayash to awake.  High above bait lohia in the Gaza Strip a small plane carrying Israeli forces circled around the Palestinian City the men inside waited with bated breath for a cell phone to ring. Once that phone rang Shin Bet commanders on the ground and outside the city would give the order to kill for roughly three years Shin Bet and the rest of Israeli intelligence.  Had desperately searched for yahia. Ayash the engineer today all that effort was going to pay off the Agents of Shin Bet were more than familiar with a Yash has work Israel had been running red with blood suicide bombers terrorizing Tel Aviv and Jerusalem all war ayash made bombs nearly a hundred or so Israeli men women and children had died by his hand.  Down in beit. Lahiya ayash was asleep in hiding from the Israeli government. He'd taken up residence in the house of a friend Osama Hamad like a Yash Osama was a member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas with Israel clothes on his Trail a Yash turned to his friend for help. Osama's Uncle Kemal could hide him Kamal was a powerful and Wealthy contractor in  Aza he owned property around the area and a Yash could easily find Refuge while he continued to make bombs. However, Osama warned a Yash that his uncle sometimes talk to the Israelis as Public Enemy Number One. It wasn't out of the realm of possibility for Kamal tutor niosh over for some reason a youngish didn't seem bothered by it around 9:00 a.m. Osama's.  Phone rang when he answered. He heard a familiar voice a Yash has father. He asked to speak to his son. Osama was more than happy to oblige. He went to a Yash has room saw that his friend was awake and handed over the phone. He told him to wish his father. Well a Yash didn't like using his own phone knowing his status as a wanted man. He knew that his conversations were probably listened in on the last thing a Yosh  Wanted was for his family to be targeted by the Israelis. So as a measure of caution, he used osama's phone.  In the airplane above the Israelis picked up on a Yash talking to his father after a few minutes. They confirmed that the voice on the other end was in fact a Yash has the man they had been tracking for years the men in the airplane were laid their confirmation to their Shin Bet superiors on the ground. It took no time at all for them to give the men back on the plane the green light to execute the plan.  A Shin Bet agent grabbed a remote Detonator and pushed the small red button.  Eventually Osama realized he hadn't heard any noise coming from the other room in quite some time. He decided to go check on his friend when Osama opened the door. He found a pool of blood slowly moving towards the door to his horror. Yahia. Ayash lay on the ground dead. His head was partially caved in and his hand was blown off.  Osama tried to remain calm but Panic quickly set in he needed to call someone someone to deal with the body. He called members within Hamas explained the situation in no time at all Hamas rushed to the apartment and claimed the body. Meanwhile word got back to Shin Bet the bomb inside osama's phone had gone off the assassination was a success after  Years of living in fear the Israelis were able to breathe a sigh of relief. Yehia a Yash the engineer the man who revolutionized suicide bombers was dead.  Coming up. We'll explore the origins of yahia a Yash and the efforts Shin Bet made to bring his reign of terror to an end now back to the story.  On January 5th 1996 Shin Bet Israel's internal security service covertly executed twenty-nine-year-old. Yahia. A Yash for years a Yash had struck fear into the hearts of Israelis with a booby-trapped bomb Shin Bet was able to put an end to a ashes reign of terror. But how was a young man able to hold an entire people and region in fear for so  Long sadly, it was the circumstances of his times.  A Yash was born in either February or March of nineteen sixty six in the Palestinian town of rifat in the West Bank like everyone else in the region both Israel and Palestine a Yash grew up in turmoil since Israel's Inception after World War II the Israelis and Palestinians have engaged in constant conflict over the disputed region. A Yash was indoctrinated to hate everything that Israel represents.  It when he was 21 years old ayash entered beers 8 University where he earned an engineering degree and soon after graduating. He married and had a child a Yash had hoped to further his education outside of Israel. His sights were aimed in Jordan. However, for reasons never explained the Israeli government denied him the chance to leave. It appears that this denial led a Yash to join Hamas.  And his reputation as a highly educated engineer earned him status among the group in no time at all. He was building some of the most devastating bombs for the organization after Decades of fighting peace between Israel and Palestine made some strides in 1993 known as the Oslo Accords Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak rabin's and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met to discuss  Roadmap to peace in the region the violence had to end the first steps of the Accords established the Palestinian National Authority an interim self governing body and made way for the withdrawal of Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.  But not everyone was happy with the Accords Hamas the Rival party to arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO believe the Accords were too weak. They wanted complete Palestinian Liberation and autonomy by any means necessary if Hamas was waiting for proof that peace between Palestine and Israel was only a myth. They sadly got it at the beginning of 1990.  or on February 25th, Baruch Goldstein and israeli-american extremist walked into the cave of the Patriarchs or ibrahimi mosque in Hebron and fired on Palestinian Muslims in the middle of prayer 29 were murdered and 125 were injured Goldstein was overpowered by those not hit by bullets and beaten to death though the Israeli  Government and Jews across the world condemned the massacre to Hamas. It was time to strike back with full force and they had a bomb expert in their ranks.  In April two months after the massacre a suicide bomber carried out an attack in the city of a fool le8 Israelis were killed and over 55 or injured a week later another bomb went off and hadera killing five and injuring 30 in October a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv murdered 22 and injured 50 and in bayete lead to bombers killed.  20 Israeli soldiers and injured over 60 more on January 22nd 1995 for Palestinians ayash became a folk hero a man dedicating his life to their Liberation, but for the Israelis who quickly identified the bomb-maker a youngish was an Insidious terrorist who needed to be stopped The Manhunt for a Yash wasn't easy though.  They knew his identity. They didn't know his location. A Yash was a master of Going Underground to make matters worse Shin Bet wasn't getting any help from the Palestinian National Authority in the fall of 1995 Shin. Bet had learned through ways that are still classified today that a youngish was living with an old classmate named Osama Hamad in a stroke of pure luck. Osama's uncle was Kamal, hammad.  At times gave information to Israeli intelligence Shin Bet knew this was their way in to add fuel to Shin BET's fire on November 4th. 1995 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak. Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Israeli extremists. The Assassin believed rabine was leading Israel in the wrong direction the new prime minister Shimon Perez knew that Israel needed.  Peace at all cost part of that was green-lighting the assassination of a Yosh.  Shin Bet knew that a Yash didn't like to use his own phone and often borrowed Osama Hamas phone to take calls Shin Bet recruited Kamal to switch out osama's phone with a device of their own telling him that they wanted to listen in on a Yash has calls. However, the phone was rigged with explosives that could be remotely detonated on January 5th. 1996 a you  She was handed the phone with his father on the other line when Shin Bet confirmed a Yoshi's voice. They detonated the bomb a youngish died instantly but a Yoshi's assassination couldn't have stopped the conflict in the West Bank. It only brought more violence after elevating him to the status of martyr Hamas retaliated almost immediately with several attacks across Israel.  And in response Israel ramped up their own efforts in targeted assassinations after a ashes death peace between Israel and Palestine all but halted in the decades since a vicious cycle of violence has continued to churn through the region only time will tell if peace will ever come but on this day in 1996 and engineer of death.  Killed by an instrument. He himself had perfected for war.  Thanks for listening to today and True Crime. I'm Vanessa Richardson for more stories like this.

You're listening to David's out for a good time a Spotify. Which podcast with me your host David ocean X key of the city Spears.com and me the lady do it the Superfund co-host. Nothing is off-limits everything we bring up as just the topics that fly into our head on a week-to-week basis and that includes our special guest coming on this week Ray black and with all those weeks in mind the lady what has happened in your week you make it sound really exciting. Actually. Nothing has happened to me my life lately. It's just been really really dead like this. Host it's so quiet. And I just like to know what I complain when there's drama and I'm complaining when it's quiet. So, you know, I'm kind of Happy the only thing that I have done though is I started second year. I am redoing my second year. I feel really good about it. I feel so much better in terms of like work like I'm prepared for it and I'm just ready to do. Well, what about you? So the thing is I had to move back into Halls because my housing situation was a nightmare. It was a nightmare, okay.  Okay, man. I told you after all of these incidents. I don't like to stress my family out, but I called my family if something happened. I called all my friends. I literally felt like if something happens to me, I need to make sure that people are aware of this so that he gets arrested. Like I did not feel safe in that place the place I was loving itself was beaut out of 10 how Beauty was it. It was literally like a 12-egg exactly. Okay. It was like a dream place like every time I'd go back and he wasn't there.  Like this place is amazing. The rent was ridiculously cheap for what it was other places in the building cost like three times what I was paying it was crazy, but there's always a catch and the catch was is he's a psycho not okay? No, you said out of ten. It was a 12-4 how beautiful was out of 10. How psycho was he 12? Exactly? Okay for the first few days, I guess I'd like a probation period of him like not really bringing.  Anything up but then I borrow one day I left and I came back in my bedroom door was open and I barely like oh, that's my weird and then like an hour gone by and I get a good message saying David I talk to you and I like go over and he's like, I just wanted like know that like when I come back from work, this place doesn't look bad. So when I walk in I can see your bedroom. I need your bed to be made Nautilus. I was like, I don't say it's my fault. I was like in a dorm like a GCSE like level like dormitory like he's gonna like hit me with a  Like I was terrified but it just like progressed and got worse. He was always making horribly horribly offensive comments and we want to bring them up because I don't like a candy bar is like bringing up such a negative space on this show which is full of positively invite, but he was just a very unhappy person and he was projecting a so much of the stuff that he was unhappy about on to me and it was just like horrible living situation a nightmare to be there. And so I was like, okay I need to go somewhere else, but it was getting closer and closer to the day that we agreed I'd leave.  Eve and to other places fell through we've discussed this before like off air ship flies in London like you will let you have a viewing booked and then it's gone before I even turned up. Yeah, he kind of is so hot I turn over so hot and so I remember getting stressed. My school is literally starting I'm going to snap in half from stress because I can't plan all of these things without knowing where I'm going to be when they happen. So I remember I lived in private halls in my first year because I live too close to London to get into like the standard.  Any provider ones and even though there are more expensive they were popping everyone there was so nice. I never had any arguments I got along with everyone there was 24-hour security all like your mail and stuff was handled for you God. I feel like a child again going back to like Halls where things are bit simpler for you. But at least she was like, it's either halls or have to like drop out and tap out. Yeah. I just don't have anywhere to be it's more about being in third year and in Halls so fingers crossed everything's fine or you'll have another fun story to hear in a few weeks this shit.  And finding a house is real it is real it is the real Adrienne Bailon where you at coming up soon. We have a story that is going to blow your mind it all involves finances and relationships and where you should be at an interview with Ray black followed up by an advice segment from one of David's lovely followeth as well as David's pops and bangers are associated past where we share all of our Tunes spoiler alert. There are two broad categories.  The tracks this week David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. So no lady. I have no idea if you've already seen this on social media, but I saw two things really circulating around and around and around one wasn't really older some 2016 independent article, but it was all because of this like social media post that they blurred out her face itself this girl put on Instagram and people screenshot to make fun of him put on Twitter. And with this girl that goes to Oxford in the like caption, which is long as hell says does not need that long of a caption put this thing about like how you know, she  Works paycheck to paycheck she studied at Oxford. She works her ass off. She doesn't get enough of student loan, but she's an older boyfriend and he always goes on these holidays and trips and work trips and vacations and she always wants to go with him. But the difference is he flies in first class. She finds an economy. Is that fucked up? Do you know what it's a tricky one? Because I'm like, there are so many like variables that just don't make sense. She is working paycheck to paycheck personally. It's a strain especially when you're in uni is a strain working for money, but at the same time  And you needs a time of living you shouldn't have to stay at home or do whatever because you you can't afford it. So I guess she wants to go on these holidays and if she's figuring out ways to pay for the myself than why not exactly. And that's what Tina Kumar told the independent in that 2016 article which people were like putting in the replies to this social media post. Tina Kumar said that her husband most of the time his work pays for him to be flying in first class. That's because she loves him so much and wants to go on these trips with him. She pays out of pocket and so she flies in economy.  What people were saying in response about the article and that post about the girl that goes to Oxford was why should you have to pay for economy, maybe split the cost of the ticket so she can join him or he can downgrade his own half the flying first class. I'm gonna fortified first class. He shouldn't have to if I can afford to find First Class. Let's say we're ground trip together not even like with Abu thing but just with a friend if we were flying together somewhere and you could only afford economy and I can afford first class just because I can doesn't mean I need to yeah, I'd have more fun and economy with you than us split apart for then that's saying something.  About their relationship exact maybe he just doesn't want to give up his lifestyle. Like he's not ready for that despite going out with this girl that I can't afford as much as him exactly. So what do we think about inequality in relationships when it comes to finances? I just think it's fine to go out with whoever you want if they're rich out of however new go out with whoever you want, but  Something eventually has to give if y'all working really hard for your money and that person's already got it going on not saying that they should bump themselves down, but they should join you on your level and then you work together. So you're both on the same level as I think but like you made a few comments about to make us on a personal level when me and my man who's not my man went to a really fancy steak restaurant and you likes to fully supportive of that concept and so I was like, yeah sure. I picked a really fancy steak restaurant where  Cheaper steak was like 50 pounds everyone wearing a suit hacker business City Financial people me and my discount a sauce knockoff cashmere sweater trying my best, but I don't when I told you about that. I don't know one of the first things he said was you can pay but make sure he offers at least first. I just thought of like cat like if he cares about you that much he might at least entertain the idea of paying you've done so many nice things for him that he should at least be like Juno I might pay a let's play all she  Know what I mean? And that's the thing is with my man. Who's not my man. I'm very lucky that I think he actually has more coin Tada than me. So he always offers because the thing is with me is an type of person I even do this with you like when we was Shake Shack or whatever like you will always offer to pay and before you can even get your heart out. I've already paid for it. I'm not type of person like where he nice they will always offer and before they can even do anything. I will make sure that the waitress or waiter whoever's in charge like make sure that it just goes to my card and I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can do that some of the time yeah.  But what would be really awkward as I had an ex wear every single day we went on he never offered and it because Y is head he thought I was bawling what figures on the first day I paid so every day after it was on the first day he did offer but every day after he didn't even offer. He just looked at me like are you ready says no and then when he was he the types of like invite you out for dinner, he'll be like no it was an even amount. We don't know. It was like a really nice relationship. Yeah, but the awkward part and what sort of let it to break apart.  Was that when it came to days does matter if it was a club doesn't matter if it was dinner doesn't matter where we went movie. It was after that first date. He never offered it was always up to me and I think the difference is when I was my with my man who's not my man who always offers to pay when I did pay for that full fancy dinner. I felt bombs. Hell I felt real cute. Am I knock off? I paid. Yeah the fine. I just felt you know, what fuck you like that car down quickly. So you feel a bit bombs. Like it's a nice feeling but it's not a nice feeling when you pee pee is other purpose even offer. Yeah.  When it comes to inequality of finances in relationships, I don't think it matters if it's like that movie Crazy Rich Asians were one of you is working class and another is like bawling. What does matter is that you treat each other with the same level of respect the person who's balling should never look down at the person who's working class and the person is working class should never look up to the person who's bawling to cover everything. Yeah, you should treat each other like your finances do not matter which is how it should be. Absolutely. Yeah completely. Tell us what you think are you dating someone where there bawling and you're not or vice versa or maybe like do  you only date people who are born because we both know people like that. Tell us what you think of as the shitty speed.com and send me a message. I Spotify original podcast.  The lady do you remember that party? We went to a while ago when you got a bit too soft up Dad I do I do I do. Okay. So while you went off with some random girl to get food I was at a table on my own didn't we know anyone else there except for the birthday girl who was off busy greeting every single person at this massive party and I would start with three other people opposite me was a black girl super nice super friendly to the left of me was a guy who a hundred straight, but had a very very long  Long earring the length of a hoop earring but not actually hoop earring was just a straight down like chain type earring and then to the right of me was a girl who made it very clear through just it's their time and all her mannerisms and voice and her discussion for upbringing it became very clear that she was sort of like upper-middle-class Posh blond white girl. Hmm and it felt so awkward because when I sat down it was one sentence into her conversation where she was trying to explain it to the guy with the earring that his earring wasn't  Like fashion, it was a political statement. Oh God. Sounds like everyone at how are you today? Basically the guy made it very clear since she said that he said, oh no, it's not a pickle statement. Like I should like my friends and I saw another guy that had an earring and then it was super cheap. So I just had to get my one myself and she was like, no slamming her heads that on the outdoor table. No, it's a political statement this patriarchy and fashion. There's capitalism fashion. And you wearing an earring is so powerful. I'm so proud of you and went to this full like drunk rant about how  Is all built into not just capitalism but patriarchy and for him to wear something in her head feminine is like a very powerful thing and he's fighting against patriarchy and then I remember after her spirit returned saying but one of your main arguments was that if we want to really beat patriarchy we should be able to wear whatever we want and not make it a big deal, but you just spent like the past 15 minutes telling this guy that what he's wearing is feminine and it's cool that he's wearing it when he told you that he just liked it. So he decide to wear it surely like him is like defeating page.  Chiaki and you're like bring it back to the table Yeah, I saying that what he's wearing is feminine you obviously weren't there for that conversation. But what would you have told her I actually wouldn't have said anything to her to be honest. I would have just carried on drinking because some of the stuff that she says doesn't affect her in any way. So I just would have just kept it moving exactly because the next Point she made after that was about like the power of black women at Uni and the way they do their hair and she said this opposite a black girl that looked so pissed off the whole conversation and then the next bunch of made was about like  He's in like she just was like talk about everything when Naughty from like unimpassioned like I want to help you guys type of way, but it felt so like white savior. Yeah, and it was so awkward because I felt like I like what you're trying to do. It's nice that you want to help but you're talking about topics that you don't understand your knowledge of them comes from like a Vice news. I just think it's like yeah fair, you know this but it's just it's not her battle to fight. No, not really she can help fight the battle in any way, but just not approaching it like that.  At exactly and you know, when we talk about white saviors if people don't know what a white see here is it's a concept that is like a complex in someone's brain where they feel like they have to help all these minorities that are around them because they have all this privilege and it's nice that she sees her privilege. But the issue is that like it's like when people go on those trips in between a levels of Jesus sees where like there's like particles organized trips like Zambia or Namibia and they like help children out or build like orphanages or schools and then their entire Facebook feed or Instagram feed for the next like a years missing the media and then it's a photo of them with like all the kids. They  And it looks so awkward seeing this like blond pigtailed girl with like for you know, black boys next door for black girls next to her on the other side that she's like helping but you're making such a big point out of the fact. She's helping it's not like a selfless deed. I know it's such a it's a football town but like Glory supporting the exactly you shouldn't need to get praised for this is something that everyone should be doing not just people with money, but you should be helping people. Anyway, you can and like not to like pop off and what I was really mad about this and I didn't say anything to them.  But my friend did at student Pride recently not this year, but the past year before that there was this guy there that was a snack. Oh man to cease look like he could pull an entire double-decker bus with just the muscles in one shoulder that he okay. He was wearing like a tank top that was like pride flag colored and just like glitter all over his face living his best life. I remember when we were like walking to the car accident. He was like kissing the girl next to me like, oh he must be by but then my friend was like really drunk.  Long and started talking to him and she was like, oh so you're like by or like what you situation just like once chat to everyone in this book is area that type and he's like, oh no, I'm straight. That's my girlfriend. We've been together for like three years and she's like, oh, do you have like gay friends that you came with to Pride at this like gay club and he's like no like we just came together like we support the community. It's really nice and like it felt awkward after he said that it's nicely support the community. It's nice that you want to wear a rainbow shirt, but going to a gay club with your girlfriend isn't really fighting the good fight.  Right now and it's about soccer. They were just taking up a place that the Q around the corner couldn't get in because those who took the plays it was just awkward man. I didn't like it. No saying that straight people shouldn't be able to go to gay clubs though, obviously, but I think I got under the circumstances of that night being like yeah probably night. I know it people that wanted to be there elephant didn't even go there gay friends. They just want a steak. I know I know completely defeats the purpose exactly. Yeah, and you know recently a couple weeks ago now Lindsay Lohan went on a crazy Instagram life it was  Actually could not believe it as I was watching. I didn't see it live but I woke up probably an hour after she had finished it because of the time difference so I watched it and it was mad. Do you know what happened with him? So again I've read about it. I know that she got punched in the face. Basically. She went on Instagram live in a nightclub as she was just leaving gone to a taxi the all the reports. I read said that it happened in Russia, but a stone that's been to Russian speaks Russian. I don't think it was Russia. Anyways apparently is in Russia. So she left the club. She was in the taxi. They were going past a homeless family and she's strict was like stop the car.  The car she got out and approached his family and he's like I want to give you a hotel. So your kids are safe for the night. I want Instagram live like you don't know who I am. But like we can do something like let's get your family some safety. It came from a nice place like we said, but then the parents like know she cut buggy buggy buggy has I'm not leaving until you let me like help you and your children and then she like I tried to help your children and then the parents like stood up grabs all the like sleeping bags everything all the clothes. They had and started walking away the opposite direction of traffic so away from her tax because they could see if she comes in get in taxi.  And she's like no come with me. She falls when she starts saying I know why you don't like come with me. You're trafficking children. Oh, no, it's yelling at them in like Russian in Arabic and then in some gibberish language like every single person's like that was not a real thing that she did with some phony accent. She was just yelling at them berating at them and then she tried to grab the hands of two of the Twins and don't worry kids. I'm gonna help you come with me and then the mom decked her and she fully follow the floor. I saw someone described as SpongeBob gasping noises like and then like three sides had to then, huh?  And then she got up. I was like sobbing actually, I'm so scared. It was like Cloverfield like she was like filming herself at the end of the day. It's a noble act to want to help a family particularly an entire family of homes people, but things I'll tougher one night is not going to fix their situation. Yeah. Yeah. The bigger part was her saying you don't know who I am, but I can try to help you guys. The bigger thing was her, you know trying to figure out like, who do we have to go to try to like fix this situation. That was the nice part, but doing it all on Instagram live and then try to kidnap two children basically and accusing a family of trafficking.  Down. Yeah, close Booboo the fool. That's what it might save. Your kind of is a person that goes out of their way acknowledging their privilege to the point where they make themselves look like Booboo the fool. Yeah. Exactly. I definitely know what you think. We're not the most educated when it comes to, you know psychology in the complex of white savior. So maybe if you go to university or studying psychology or sociology, you can give us some more info. So we feel a bit more educated on this message me at the shitty Spears.com a Spotify original podcast.  Each week we hear from you guys at home who have submitted your questions to the shit. Nice peers.com asking us for all sorts of advice questions be relationship or relationship or relationships. But let's hopefully go around something else and that's why I picked this question for this week because as many heart traumatic moments, we've had around relationships. We want something fresh and new. So if you want me one of those fresh and new topics, please submit your questions in but with that said this week, we had a really good question from Chanel Azalea on  Tumblr the lady take away with her question. She asked us I'm 23 years old and a single by woman. I live in the countryside and have for the past year and a half since I left University. I returned home because Manchester was too expensive and I thought it would be a small gap before I save up in return. I am still saving and it'll probably be another year before I can afford returning to Manchester or a city of a similar level. Although Manchester is my preference. I live in a small town.  Down and haven't faced homophobia or stereo typical small town views, but I have missed out on the gay scene. My gay friends back in Manchester and the general wider sense of Freedom. That isn't available when I'm at home. What do I do? The thing is with this is it sounds like you're in quite a good place because you see there's not really any homophobia you say that there's not small town views, which we know some of our listeners probably do face and deal with so it's difficult because it seems like you're a really good secure place, but I understand what you're missing.  If you've saved saved saved, I feel like you can splurge on one weekend. You have your friends there stay over there for a night go out have a really good night gay clubs with all your girls hitting it off and then obviously you come back to the countryside but at least it's that taster so you don't feel just like trapped in this Countryside moment. Take the train up take the bus. However, you can get their cheapest stay with your friends. You have friends still in Manchester go out with them do like a long weekend. It'll just give you that taste. What do you think?  Lady I agree with with you to be honest. I don't know why abouts in Manchester if you want to live because there are parts that I like super cheap or super expensive which is Central. So I think you could move depending on how much you save up. You could move somewhere that might not be to your taste, but you can move from there on to somewhere else where you want to be. I don't think Manchester is that expensive? But obviously if you have Higher Goals then maybe saving up and staying home might be for the best.  But do take weekends there you have multiple ways of getting to Manchester house and you can always like even not going out but there's so many other things to do the so many gigs there for one. There's so many people that visit their the shows there's a lot of things to do and I think if you're really missing it then by all means visit but also start small if you're going to move and then work your way up. Yeah, and if you have a really good relationship with your parents and like you said, there's hardly any homophobia issues. They're if they're really good friends. Obviously, it's be easier for you.  You as a single person to commute there, but maybe invite them down to your time. Like hey, this is where I grew up. Like, I've not really been two whole we're in a ladies room. But the amount of times I've been like I actually really want to go there it's foreign for your I mean like it's nice because I'll be there with you. Yeah, wink wink nudge nudge come very start. I think like obviously be easier because it's just one person rather than inviting a ton of people at once and hoping they'll come through but I think you should try a lot of people that I've talked to growing up upside is you know when you're young  You're at home and you ge you sort of feel like trapped in it. Regardless how your parents are your pets might be the most supportive liberal amazing parents out there that you don't feel as adult or free like you can do whatever you want. Like maybe your parents don't care if you come back at 3:00 a.m. Maybe your parents won't care. If you bring back a boo thing, but you still feel awkward because it's your parents when you went back to whole recently. Yeah. Was it awkward being at home? I missed my own space. It's fun having my mom around see my brother, but I just miss being able to do my own thing. I sleep so.  So late and my mum has a regular sleep schedule, so I'll be like on the phone so that it should be like down. I just miss that whole like I'm in my own space. I don't need to worry about anything else. It was a little bit little bit suffocating, but I know what the feeling of like being home for too long does. Yeah, we both empathize with you if we were you against it because we don't know your exact situation. We would go up for a long weekend. Thank you Chanel Azalea for sending in your question, and I hope me and David managed to give you some good advice.  You can walk through.  A Spotify original podcast. Hi. My name is Gregory my coming out story isn't that bad? Actually I came out on holiday with my family. We just want to love Simon and I thought based on their reactions. It was the perfect time to come out they had it so well, so I'm very lucky because I know not everyone is I actually found out that I've got four Gay relatives. I never even knew about the song I chose comes from the love Simon soundtrack and it's Never Fall in Love by Mo.  If you would like to be a part of next week's Colin come out visit the shit nice peers.com and send it in. Honestly. I love hearing them. Sometimes we get some that we don't put in the episode but in Lady and I still go through and it's just so cute cause there's so many stories that are like sad or moving but overall mostly they're just inspirational but moving away from calling come out we can go straight to David's Bops and bangers the Spotify Associated playlist. Make sure you check it out. It has everything from episodes 1 2 & 3 including the songs. I give you the secret gay history behind them, but then lady I want to hear your bobson bangers and if you wander the difference between pop or  Go back to episode 1 with Courtney acts because we do a full run-through, sir. My first song is Artic Monkeys one point perspective. That's from the latest album. I kind of chose this one because I miss my friends from home so much and we saw them this Summer and my next song is Lana Del race some a bummer featuring ASAP Rocky and Playboy Carly. It's a Bop and Rihanna consideration featuring scissor. The only thing I have to say about this song is that I hope they make another song together. It slaps. It's  It's so good. That's my favorite. That's my second favorite also for that album. And this is a comes out with her next album on literally like Rihanna. Please be on the album and my next song is MK 17 just to like bang it up a little bit because on my songs are like kind of a little slow. It's a dance song and I had the opportunity to see him at Park life, but I missed and then my last song is something about him from brackhampton, which is from the latest brackhampton album iridescent. It's an Ode to Kevin.  Ex ex boyfriend and it's really sweet actually from my understanding. There are like 40 members of the group from the musicians to producers to like Market in team. What I really admire about this group is that they keep everything within the squad everything they make is a mosh pit Banger. So listen to him speaking of Mars, but Banger my five songs begin with brockhampton and I was certain I was gonna die at their concert. It wasn't a mosh pit was just like a death push. That's what it was like, but my five songs,  Open with Boogie by brockhampton that's not from iridescent. That's from their previous album. It goes. Oh, I don't know spelt both o FF and aw f it is so good. That's my favorite song by them. They have so many good songs. So definitely go through the discography, but we're putting to onto this week. So the next thing I have is Best of My Love by the emotions. So this is a throwback. I love sort of, you know, things like The Supremes and all that style. And this is a bit more recent. This was from the 80s, I believe but I know everywhere. I think it's so cute. I love song.  Just like so like here's my heart on a platter for you. And I would do anything. The next thing I have is sorrynotsorry by Demi Lovato. So, you know last year on my birthday with my lady. I put this in the aux and I saying every lyric off-key off Tunes so loud in the Uber and it's the only time I'm 99.9% sure. I've got a rating below for like I was the belting it you cannot convince me. I was not Demetria Lovato in that Uber. The next I have is gorgeous by Taylor Swift  So something I do at 3 a.m. When I'm really like Manic and like can't sleep is I always listen to songs and it's as if my bedroom is now the O2 Arena I have you know, 30,000 seats sold out and I'm lip-syncing my life, you know giving everyone the full concert experience. So one of the songs I always do is gorgeous by Taylor Swift because it has you know, really good be it's really fun mid-tempo. So that's the song I picked to be forth. And the next song I have is crew by Ray black re and kojo funds.  So in a bit, we have an amazing interview with Ray block and this is like my favorite song by heart the minute. She has so many amazing tracks and she's going to tell us what other track she wants on the playlist. So look out for that. But the first thing I picked is by her is obviously crew. It's really upbeat. I got to hear re-perform it when she opened for Guess Who Halsey and the crowd really went with it. It's so good live and it sounds as good on recording. So every week I always pick a song that has a sort of meaningful or secret queer history behind it. We've had contemporary hits by Ariana Grande and  Selena Gomez and we've also had you know an older hit by Diana Ross. I want to take it back once again, but as I Was preparing this I realized there was a cover that most of you guys probably we'll know better and then when I was going through that cover I realize there was another history behind it. So with a double sort of secret gay history behind it. We have You Don't Own Me but not the Lesley Gore original from the 60s. It is the cover that came out three years ago now by grace and G-Eazy some of you may know it from the trailer for Suicide Squad that came out three years ago, Margot, Robbie and  Leto the song itself sort of went viral even though it was the Lesley Gore version in the film. Now the reason I picked this song originally I was working on the Lesley Gore song was because Lesley Gore actually was a lesbian and right before she passed away at tons of stories came out about her and offered a lot of them attributed the fact that she came out to the Year 2005. They said that she came out and interviewed then but really she said she was never in the closet. She just really was sort of out but at the time it was such a taboo not only to be gay but to ask someone especially in an interview are you  gay and so when this song came out and she was only 16 no interview would ever ask her about her sexuality and then her career sort of went down after these few songs when she was 16 17 18. And so I time she was an adult and actually had a partner when she passed away the partner and her were together for 33 years. No one actually thought about like, oh we should probably should have asked her about this when she was alive, but I picked the grace and G easy version because in case you didn't know gz actually grew up in the Bay Area with two moms, and he's one of the not only few rappers with one of the few musicians. I can think of that grew up with  Parents. I think it's really cool that he's so open about like how he grew up and it's really amazing because there's so many people out there, especially that like his music as he does. So while he's so successful that have gay parents and it's sort of like he can be a sort of role model for you know, growing up with gay parents. So I picked the grace and she easy version not only because you at home might know more than Lesley Gore version but also because it's pretty cool that geeez has a featured guest rap verse on it and he wrote with gay parents. So that's the secret gay history song of the week.  All the box and bangers on our playlist you can stream are by either lgbtq Talent OR alleys of the community. You will not see a song on here by someone who's throwing around F slurs or is horrible to our community David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. We are here with Ray black. Thank you so much for coming in. Thanks for having me. I'm so excited to have you here. It's annoying. It's a podcast because you look bomb at haha you except we have a photo of us in here.  They need to know that you turned it. Now. I had to make a good impression. Well, very good price. Yeah, so, you know you grew up in catford you went to school with Emenike and you started a band with him. That's so cool me tell me how that happens. So we were all in secondary school together and then I like 13, so it was his older brother that was in the same year as me and he just used to pester me all the time like come and play out. This is playing out.  Come play out like come to my house will hanging out and how like he records they record songs and his dad's garage and I thought this sounds so lame. So so lame, but then I heard one of the songs they made no Zack. Hold on. This is actually sick like like top quality like you guys need to be on the radio. So he was like exactly to join the band and then I joined and it was like every day after school. We make songs or together and his brother was like the songwriters Emenike. He was writing all of the Melodies and stuff and he was just crazy.  Into it and you went from you know playing out as you said, yeah making songs back that in school to literally this is your job. It's not a major. So amazing. What's the like day-to-day? So right now, what is your sort of you a cop and then from there so a regular day with Ray black is I wake up I go to the gym well for the past what few weeks now come through and then either I'll be in the studio. So I might go to the studio from like 12 o'clock and I'll record till like 8:00 o'clock. Maybe the other day I had  ASL so yesterday I woke up went to the gym. Then. I had an interview that I did over the phone for like an hour and then I went to the rehearsal studio and I was there for like nine hours and you know, we were recently at a party and there was a girl there that was like such a mega fan of yours and she told us a story that like after your gig at a festival. I want to see Glastonbury by matter what she said it. She said that she liked ran up to you with all her friends and it's like fangirling out is it weird to like have people run away? I love it because  So sweet and it's just appreciation can see the people who are listening to your music. It's affecting but like sometimes it happens. I'm still taken by surprise. Like I was talking to my friend about this the other day that I'm still weirded out when I catch people looking at me because like naturally where I'm from you just don't look at each other in London. We just don't you don't look at each other. Look at the ground don't smile each other so someone staring at me. I'm like yo Le is it beef like what because they  Sighs you don't like. Oh, yeah, I forgot that. It was like the first time someone recognized you. Yes, I do and I can't describe the feeling but it was after I think my friend and I went to go and see a show or something and it was outside Camden station and there were these three girls and it was so weird because so they were like topping up their oyster and talking about me and be like, oh my God, have you heard of a black? Yeah, so have 50/50 video and it was so amazing and blah blah blah and then we're like walking in the stage.  My tie - oh my gosh, and it was so weird. It was just so weird should welcome. Like boom is that anyone that you've met so far that you're like, oh my God, I can't believe it bro. So two days ago, I facetimed with Elton John. Oh, that was insane. That was unbelievable. And I don't like I knew it was happening, but I still can't believe it and then when it was ringing and I picked up and I saw his face I literally  I screamed like that. He just kind of looked at me. Sorry. Sorry, but yeah, that was a crazy moment. Is he someone you like to work with one day definitely definitely want some a fan of music Kendrick Lamar. All right. Yeah top Kendrick if you're listening shout me from wherever you are Kendrick Maya he's at the top of the list who else Jay-Z I love is all rappers because I'm just such a huge fan of rap Nicki Minaj.  I'm a bob. Yes, I'm a Bob. Sorry, you're wrecking queen. I am queen of Freedom. I'm in the Kingdom. I'm in the Kingdom. So something is really cool. Is you already worked with so many amazing people. So one of the songs on are associated playlist David's pops and bangers is your song Crew with kojo funds and Ray. I was working on that. That was so cool. That was so so cool because I love working with people like in my scene right now as well because we've all got different Vibes and flavors. So we were all a  actually in the studio together which is rare lot of the times when you hear feature tracks, they're in different places, but we will actually all in the same place at once and did it together and something else that's really amazing to me is especially cuz I'm sure nobody can really so you're really just right. So Milady is as well and it's so amazing as you but you're both still so accepting of so many types of people and because sometimes you know, for example the Westboro Baptist Church, there's you know places that say their churches but then all this pee out is hate and anger and you know, they protest  You know the Orlando shootings. I'm not gay nightclub the Westboro Baptist Church there and pick it at all the funerals and so it's so amazing, especially with m'lady and you that you know, you see your faith as something so loving and accepting. So like what is faith mean to you? That's what it is for me being a Christian is about love ya like it sounds so silly but like God is love ya and the first commandment is to love your neighbor as you love yourself like yo, you are meant to show love to all people act as Jesus word, which would be showing love to others and not  being so focused on myself. It's not about hate at all. Exactly. Yeah, and you know, we got a lot of messages on the show asking for advice and something I recently saw was, you know people asking about like can I be religious and gay can I be religion lesbian and you know, it doesn't matter if you're Christian Jewish Muslim, whatever religion you follow you can absolutely be religious and gay. There's nothing that's stopping you unless you want to join the Westboro Baptist Church that I may be a hard pass on that one. Ya know like God says come as you are like he  People as they are like so my mom she's a pasta and my mom she used to go to this like basically extreme Christian church. So it was really old school where you had to wear skirts women weren't allowed to wear trousers can't pierce your ears. You're not allowed to wear makeup. You might like to have colored hair and my mom used to do all of those things. Well trousers had blond hair pierced. Her ears War loads of makeup and she was just always like well, it's about love and God says come as you are. So why should I be something? I'm not and think God won't love me. So.  And you grew up in cap for Italy still sort of in that General South London area. I am representing right now. I'm not going anywhere. So I've moved from catford but funny enough. I've only move like 15 minutes away because I just couldn't leave so when you come through and you like still see some of the people that you might have grew up with is it sort of a weird to be in the two dynamics of Ray black who's performing at International festivals as amazing songs of all these like chart-topping artists and then you know, you're still sick.  In so-and-so from school. Like is it like a weird dynamic jumping between you know, the ray they know and the ray that is you know, who you're on stage. You know, it really isn't not with my day-to-day friends anyway, because all of my friends are like from school from college, so they just know me as me and I've seen me at my shows and they see me in their house or whatever. So it feels the same maybe when I see people who are haven't seen in a long time, sometimes I just feels like there's a disconnect because they don't see me as my real name's Rita there.  Not looking at me as Rita anymore. So the same way you'd see someone you haven't seen in ages. I'm like, oh my God. Hey, how are you doing? The let's exchange numbers. Let's meet up. There's just this like disconnect there. They kind of like, oh hi. Do I still hug? You do I have Asus like you're being weird being weird, but also at the same time like especially since the show is come out. I've not mentioned this on the show before is you know, I've seen certain people come out of the woodwork and it's not even it's just like they want clout. Yeah, like I've seen people that like,  I've not talked to since like Jesus. He's message me like and put me on the spot like you I'm so proud of my friend David. I'm like, yeah Yanks didn't say happy birthday. But yo on your story. Yeah, and it's not even snaky behavior is like they were like dude have you had people like that? I'll absolutely people are always looking for clout especially now in the like social media age people. Just want to say they know you like that's their claim to fame like someone recently actually who isn't my friend at all. So I went to one of my best friend's house is she just had a baby and one of her  Her friends was there and she called me the next day like so I was with X person again and we with other people and she was like, yeah, I was hanging out of Ray black yesterday were chilling. Yes. She's my girl like blob. This is not even and it's called Cameo which has a lot of online stores, but there's some people like the Real Housewives from like love, Ireland and  You do is they set a fee and basically they will send you a personalized video that's from like Instagram style. So you can put on your story so you can get like a shout-out like someone but you set the price. So if you wanted you could be like for 250 pounds of Pop. I'll send you a shot at be like yo, it's very black just saying like I'm here with my girl make sure to follow her. Oh my God. I love that. That's so lame. But I love that you can make money from that. I would so do that. So it was me my  if you like a solid 25 P, but for 25p, I will shout you out. So, you know, we went through your schedule and right now you're busy rehearsing but there's also like around that an album coming out soon. Yeah, so is anything can say about that or is it still very hush-hush? No, I can I can say little bit not too much. I've got a project coming out right now. People are like a project. What is it? What is it? And for me? I'm just calling it that because I feel like it's not my debut album. Like it's only eight songs. So first was short and  I've progressed a lot more since when I first actually made these songs some of these songs are from 2016. So that's coming out October the 26th. And in my album probably going to be out early next year buzzing. Is there a title in your head yet? So the project coming out it's called Empress. I'm named after one of the tracks on the project and it's just because it was inspired by just self-love. I know that sounds so like cliche but I felt like when I was writing those songs, I was really in a state of like just love.  In myself and haven't come out of a bad situation and feeling like why did I let somebody treat me like that? I should have held myself, you know higher and I shouldn't have accepted being treated like that for so long and I was like, I'm not going to date anybody. I'm just going to focus on loving myself. So that the next person I meet I make sure that they treat me the way I should be something I often see which sounds like it's not even like a Zen quote but it's just something that like as soon as you hear you realize like the power of it is you shouldn't have to convince someone and  To try to get someone who isn't treating you the way you should just be treated and people will run after someone chase after summer change their personality. Yep pay for every dinner pay for every Uber do everything they can because they're just so infatuated with that person. They will do everything I can to make that person feels crazy about them as they go out and it shouldn't be like it should be that they should just automatically feel that way. Yeah. I kind of like the thing of and this problematic Milady always drags me for this. I kind of like that infatuation period I kind of like being so crazy about you.  Like I know but it's just like there's so many amazing feelings around that and obviously sort of like subsides but you don't you see some of these like really like these relations people have been together for like thirty three plus years and they still feels crazy about each other as they did day one. Like that's the goal is and yeah goes goals and everything goal at the minute is everyone sucks. Good night. I'm currently on right now just like nah, the lady is not have the best luck with man Amy. This is  Hey, I'm here. I was like guys forgive me shot the man Dem as well. But my line was like, oh, man. I try.  No, I'm not. I can't I just can't I'm so scared of being screenshotted. I don't even like apply to Dear but this is something we discussed in last week's episode. There's not really a shame anymore. Like went endurance. Our first came out like if you were on Tinder, it was a considered cringe America. I give to go on a dating up but now so many people have it like it's not even good on it. Try it or try real we discussed this last week as well Ray. It's a celebrity dating app so that the Soho  House of dating apps so Amy Schumer met her husband on it. Laughs Colin Farrell was on it for a bit. There's so many because you have to get accepted if the link your ieg they go through your Instagram. Yeah. First thing is you're beautiful so usually get straight away, but they check how many followers you have what you're known for who you're working with or who your friends are if you have friends ready on the app, but you're maybe a date away from Colin Farrell. I'm actually going to do that now like genuinely, I'm not saying I don't think I said this book and nothing that's  Really cool about you as I love your life performances because there's so much and that's not to say like no Shades like a doll who just on stage with a mic like I love the theatrical nests of it. I love that you have such a creative mind that you aren't just someone has to be on stage people have to go check out your videos of performances. Especially I'm blanking on the name of the award show that you that you did with run run right to the woods. Yes. That was so amazing. Thank you. So what goes into the thought process behind some of those performances so much. I'm a bit crazy. So I'll have like a while.  Wacky ideas, like okay. So we need to have like a moving robot on the stage who blows out fire and then like, let's just take it step by step. Maybe you know album 3 ha ha ha What's with fire? But for me, I just always liked him ajan what I would want to say because I'm a huge concert. Go on last year. I think I actually went to 50 concerts. I think that includes festivals I was at but then I went to go see the other person or people that like can't see because I was this is the podcast the ladies I just  Cause as soon as she said 50, we're just on the floor at the same time. That is high. I just I love going to see live shows just because I variance is such an experience. I don't like as an artist as well you get to learn so I'm a bit of like a steel arm. I believe like all good artists steal. So I'll be like like I saw Drake recently inspiration. That's the inspiration. Here we go inspired. Yeah and that he does this thing at his live shows where he's like, you want me to stab all you want more. You are more. Let me know if you want more.  Walk and go home right now. And like I feel like I've seen that much a moment and I was like, I might try that last I went to five festivals no shade to me goes but they came on stage. They were maybe four acts before the headliners. So you as a rap band on the main stage at reading really have to like pull that crowd through as much as they might hate playing bad and bougie at every gig they did that year. They know that's what the crowds gonna know don't know they did when it came to Baton Rouge E before the intro. They said who here likes.  Love's your mom crowd cheers, of course who here loves festivals who loves reading crowd cheers who loves me goes and the car was like fly and then we go Stone, sir. Okay, then they're going to bad and bujji. They do the first verse and then cut it off there and walk off stage and they ended it that no change that to do leap up because you know being a pop girl at a festive like writing which again is still very like rockish that day.  Whatever headliner was Kendrick Lamar which isn't like that but in general that weekend is still very rockish. That's what it started as a festival and she pulled through she did all the hits. She did all the choreo she dropped out and like jumped with the crowd like it's that type of thing. That's what you're so God is like everyone at the videos. I've seen a few performing at festivals or award shows. It's like they don't care that it's an award show or a festival more. It's become a real black and that's how it should be. That's not a mindset enough artists have now you've got a work I'm always thinking about like, what can I do to  Entertain people more. What can I do to excite them a show? What would I want to do? What would I want to see? Sorry. I'm always just thinking about that like what's good for the crowd? Because at the end of the day people have paid money. Yeah that respect the fact that somebody has gone to work and they have said I'm going to spend 50 pounds of my art hard-earned money to come and see this person. So I'm sure like, you have to give them a show and for people who are loyal fans as well. They keep coming if they love the show like these two guys, they always at the front of my show and like singing and dancing together and I could  And we lost and I love them so much and it's like you have to give to those people who have come to see a good show, you know, do you follow them on Instagram that I actually do so cute who is like someone that inspires you but you've mentioned Drake like he inspires you and performances. But what about in music it changes all the time, you know, I'm really really inspired by a lot of different artists when I first started out writing songs. I was really inspired by Amy Winehouse.  House love and Lauren Hill as well just because lyrically, they are just such incredible artists like the way they convey their message with Lauren for me. It was like the purpose behind the music. Yeah. Well and for me with Amy, it was just the realness of everything like I loved her realness and it made me feel like okay. I don't have to make like bubblegum pop music and be a damsel in distress. Like I can be like, I don't need that man because he trash like I can just give the real so they really  Bad me and when I first started writing but I'm always listening to like the new album and being inspired by that like recently up and listen to Travis Scott's new album a lot and like it's actually incredible. It is like listening to that album like, oh my God, this is just so creative. I love hearing music that is unexpected it and it's just different and not like everything you're hearing out on the radio that I really love James Blake as well. So here in him on that album was like, yeah, but him I love him so much because it's like, how do you hear this in your head?  Like how is this what you come up with? So, you know, we mentioned run run already from the award show performance that you did which people need to check out because moving but what else is check out his wow is the video that is so incredibly moving and so powerful. Was it like a lot to take in when you like storyboarded and thought like this is what I want to do. Yeah. It was it was such a big process. I would say that is one of the most challenging videos I've had to make because I just really wanted it to be perfect and I wanted it to convey the people who the song is about.  In the right way and I think a lot of the directors didn't really understand that they were like, okay. Well, let's have this guy and then he shoots somebody and blood one is like no we're trying to show what it's like to live a day in the shoes of somebody who lives in a poor estate where he feels that he needs to protect himself because every day if it's not someone else is after him with a knife. It's the police are after him or you know, or there's crime around him or there's poverty or we can't get a job. I wanted to show like the day in the life of like why this is actually happening in these areas.  And so I remember we went through the my label was so annoyed at the because I was just like no two all of the directors and all of their pitches and then I wrote out this like dissertation basically unlike the purpose of this video and what I want it to represent and then eventually we got like I think the last treatment from this director called Tom Green who had never made a music video before he had only done adverts, but he does really moving adverts and so he was just the perfect person for IT. Like he has natural empathy and I love the passion that just  Answer me or even just hearing you say the word dissertation about it's the activism and the things that you're so okay with discussing and openly sharing that I think just so moving and shows why you are like leagues ahead of some of these other girls. I've entered industry what is currently like a really big issue that maybe not even necessarily if I can you whatsoever or even your friends or family budget in general you see happening right now and you just think we need to do more about it. Wow, this so much in the world. That's wrong. So many issues.  Issues. Okay. So one that has been coming up a lot that I think is really important simply because I think amazing thing with social media is that we have platforms to say how we feel and communities can come together and you know make a difference and right now I'm seeing a lot of people speaking up about colorism and I have somehow become, you know good or bad. I've become kind of like the poster girl for like dark-skinned female in the music industry because you know, there has been a lack of representation, you know.  I think throughout my Years anyway growing up it was rare for me to see a black skinned person in a film and a music video as a singer any of these things in the magazines let alone a darker skinned person and it's not just a black issue. I know it's huge in the Asian Community as well. They talked about how you know, they prefer fair-skinned people and I feel like that's something that needs to be addressed instead of people pretending like it doesn't exist. Yeah, because I think with a lot of social issues if it doesn't affect you you feel like it's not a  Real thing and people are exaggerating because it's just like well, what are you talking about? There's that one black person there chillout, the one example one example, exactly. So I just feel like I'm more attention needs to be paid to that by the people who create the Magazine's the people who direct the music videos the people who are signing artists to be like not that you have to tick a box but to just be aware of that and to be like, okay cool in this campaign. We should make sure that we do represent all types of people, you know, so people can see  Because otherwise you feel excluded and you feel like oh, I'm not beautiful. I remember a lot of girls are mad me feeling like well, no guys ever is going to chat to me or whatever because I'm a darker-skinned gone, you know people just you shouldn't feel like that something about recently came to like my attention through social media and this is an issue that has not just happened today yesterday a week ago. There's been around for a very long time and it's been something that I want to learn how to deal with and I will learn how to change because I've noticed in my own  words and you know just being friends in the lady often times I end up copying her faces. There's a lot of stuff especially about white gaze white gay males specifically a lot of their slang or lingo that they use stems from black women and there's always been a debate about whether that's one racist or two if it's problematic or if it's okay and it's just, you know, adopting culture and it's just spreading it on or you know, it's one minority going to another minority. What do you think about that some interesting because my friends and I were talking about it not too long ago, and I feel like a lot  stuff is appropriated without people even realizing like, you know, we talked about like choosing a white model to have came Rose or an afro in a magazine instead of actually just getting a black model and I think the issue with that is that when black women are made a caricature of is when we are then accepted like a lot of people feel like I love cardi B, by the way, but a lot of people feel like cardi B is problematic because a lot of the things she says the way she acts which is very, you know, caricature out there crazy wild ratchet get  Otto is how people view black women's it kind of feels like, oh are we being made fun of so I think at some points it can be it can be problematic. I think the issue is like we need more positive representation. And also we need more acknowledgement of where those things stem from. Like if you're going to be like Bo Derek braids Kim Kardashian gonna be like Bo Derek braids, like can we acknowledge that this came from Nefertiti instead of being like, oh I've started my own thing and you know, yeah, I think I think  That's where the issue is is like we're so tainted and so ignored but then when somebody else does it it's like sick. Yeah, absolutely because it's sort of you know, they saw a video reason that v files that on YouTube and they were talking about like where the word Yas came from and the person they like originated it or decide like as the history of the word was a 2014 vine where Lady Gaga was leaving the Good Morning America studios. I'll go back and there was like a bunch of her like stands waiting for the Cars Go pass with the window down. Yeah.  Yeah, and she had her like long long like blond hair out the window like she look good. Yeah, but then all the fans like a Yas Gaga, you look so good. And that's what v files decided was like the origin the word. Yes, but how about that's it wasn't like a white gay guy in New York that started that work. Yeah when Lady Gaga left, he obviously took it from someone else. Yeah person was probably a black woman because I what I often see on a show like RuPaul's Drag Race is when they do use that word or culture and then it comes to them saying, you know, they never made it up. They then attribute it to the  Come on that told it to them or their whoever it may be. They don't return that they started it. So if your issue more about not giving credit, yeah for me, I think everyone has their own feeling towards it but for me, I think it's like the lack of credit the lack of acknowledgement. It's like it came from Lady Gaga which is like what are you talking about? Like it's definitely didn't or that the Bo Derek braids things and it's just like you need to give credit where credit is due, you know, I mean, like people forgetting that  Rock music Started actually from Black Culture. Exactly. I think that's what it is and we just feel like a lot of black people at what I think most black people anyways for like we've just been ignored and kind of just put in the shadows and just kind of like ripped off like for instance. Okay. One thing I was talking about the other day was how much British people love curries we love a curry, but now it's become part of like it's like a British thing. I can't remember where I saw it was like, oh you British food and it's like Kareem was like, no, it's not like it just it just isn't  What do you mean you've just stripped these people if their identity May lie always our thing now, so I think it's just you need to give credit where credit is due. Thank you so much for coming on those. I feel like inspired and empowered. Like I feel like I'm like literally I feel like I just want to like the most amazing like University lecture and like your boy wasn't on his computer doing a million other things. He was sat there and they got every single workout. I got that on a sauce like tubs discount through long drop.

I'm not gonna lie, but I decided to be a bitch and I was going to try to go into the album and then be like, oh this bitch is so and so but that shit. Meaty and even though you couldn't waste bitch. I finished the album and I didn't even  I realize until I came back to the phone that I saw it on it because you were on your head.  That's ugly. What's your song bitch? So my song is so I don't really use post cologne. But like my song is wow discovered it on accident and I listen to it once and I was kind of Shook and yeah. Wow, I post cologne, you know, what else knocks a lot by um by a 21-7 resistant dogs. Yeah.  What was your song did mine so I'm kind of I'm going in between because it's a few slides but I think my song of the week. I'm still stuck on kalani's 80s. It is so good. Yeah, I think number one this week. Yes. Oh my God and the billboard R&B on the R&B charts her all her now. Are we see number one? Cuz it's easy and nobody's here. No, are we only going to apply this are ya? Oh my God easy. Let's just be real it's easy right now, but  Philip well, she knows I'm not number one on Billboard's. He's number one on like not on the top 100. It's on the RMB the R&B charts. I think. Yeah, and I think that's still not come with me accomplishment and it's not that easy because not everybody has not if not, everyone has one. It's okay, since you want to be that girl, let's reel it back Ariana. I mean it was a she I'm releasing you probably says when it's clear that there's nobody in the swimming hole.  She jumps her out into the deep end. Usually she's in the king's pool have no. Okay. Okay and the kiddie pool and that's fine get grab at it while you can says, but what I'm smythe-webster wed that Bangles are out to play Ariana has no say kailani y'all like some way are we on the foot holds what way?  Here we go. That to me. That is actually like good. Well, that's kind but I'm not and they're totally my wait their turn different artists like hell on he's not trying to be an Ariana Grande. So now there but it's different when has Kalani tried to yeah. No. No, it's not like it's not a competition. Like you're really you're standing is showing and it's ugly because they come back they are like, they don't even apply like he doesn't even attempted to like try to like hit like,  but everyone that she's not crossing over here or not, but it's easy. Yeah, it's easy at the end of the day, but I was comparing. What are you saying? Like a spy? I'm confused easy with what there's easy with just haters. No one here. So blue. It's plenty of R&B girls out right now when you talk about that's not even the same thing.  But it's not because she's R&B. Yeah an R&B person doing it and Ariana doing it are two different things. What are you saying? Essentially? What what kehlani not be considered R&B and pop this house is not popped on. Yeah, this album is not pom. It ain't none of that. Like it's lame muster. Yeah, like sweet sexy Savage. I would say if she put that out now knowing that nobody was out and it did I would say that was hey mom, so that's our first album, right?  That's more of a pop record than this. This is like strictly on the 5S girl, you gotta you know, what we be talking about Quran, right, correct? Whoo, you trying to stand and just standing I won't take you back. I will keep the same energy, but he will but it doesn't apply with Kalani. Thank you. So yes my song of the  Week is too deep. I love that song Too Deep is my favorite right now. So I'm listening to that. Yeah, I just really love that whole EP none yet from like many. I just hits it for me everything hits it and then to deep I got into it this week. It gives me like I said lot like I said to his but it's just very like Randy like to me like very footsteps is amazing like not like he's  I just want a lot more girls to because the arm be now is not it for me. I don't see it for her. I know y'all like her. I'm happy for her. But no, so we're walking the FBI know this walk is cool. What's that other Scott summer summer Skies sound summer Walker summer Walker's I like she's just not for me. I just like I feel like I'm listening to One at one long-ass song the case.  Someone that's okay. That sounds that's what that's what might be. The only one that I could do use right now. Barely Ramona and well, I love she's not I'm not putting her in that category is t period she's not like, you know main stop. Well, none of them are I mean, they're made a lot of them already are mainstream for I guess they're like, they're popular but I mean like I'm talking about the girls who are leading the pack right now. I think I'll amazing only one that I can really enjoy because I don't feel like her album has one long-ass.  A song like I feel like I feel like when I say that thank you. That was he loved to call me out for some wrong - I never said that because that when the album came out actually said yesterday I couldn't get into it. I couldn't get it. I guess it was it was long. You said it was boring. Yes. It was very boring to me. I never saw me think about what a moment a moment. That was so boring. I never listened to the album. Yeah. I didn't guess who I just know I've heard.  Shot clock turned gray pussy bounce to the other one true. Yeah, but um, yeah, can we? Okay, that's the real question because that's the girl with the kin God dang bu pinup all R&B pins right now. Thank you. But I'm yeah kehlani too deep. I love kiwami.

Gale King and it was an attempt for his team to make him look like, you know a victim attempt by who feel like if team they fight  This goes right up there. This goes right up there with.  With that last interview with that interview. He did on BET and the man said do you like underage girls? And he was like, how old are we talking? Because at this point like, I don't know what arkells the teen girls and he said how old are we talking? Yeah 13th and 19. So like he did the interview was it kind of like aired in like pieces?  And every piece was a hot-ass mess. If you haven't seen it, you can literally go on all of social media. They've made like a jockey club breathing there what they aired a whole Whatchamacallit needs of the whole interview on Friday. Yeah, like Friday night the whole thing. Yeah, and they showed it. They showed it, but I missed it and I don't know I put it on I actually checked out Clips, but basically so I'm just gonna give you a little synopsis gnosis sip gnosis, so  The interview okay, they say jail kind of starts off with the obvious questions. Like why I like how did we get here? Why after all these years you're still doing the same thing his financial situations everything R.Kelly basically denounced everything said that everybody's lying on him and all these women are lying on him and and you know, women are scorned sometimes so they make up these things. They all want him for his money mind you money, but he doesn't have  Um because he can't even bail himself out of prison. He got mrs. Bentley and has limited daycare be quiet about how he couldn't see his kids and he wanted to have relationship with his kids mind you he's the he's separated himself completely from one because his child was very first yes andreea has said multiple times. He has not tried to make any connection with his kids. But of course he went on Good Morning America and made it seem like you can see my black man. Who's just trying to do.  Do it for his family and you know all that bullshit that Charles of as real and and joycelyn were on the interviews. Well Gail interviewed them hoes lying to they said that they never wanted bathing parents just saying as we all caught an attitude with Gayle King couldn't have been me girl. And as you're also fake cried like our Kelly R. Kelly also gave us a very extremely often.  I couldn't not convincing but oscar-worthy. Yes if it's not convincing, how was it oscar-worthy? That'll make no sense in coming. I feel worthy to the black hound dog Cryin all the time. It wasn't convincing but the Oscars live for he turned into a whole meme in less than 24 hours. That's some stank so it wasn't convincing to us, but it was mean worthy and hey, yeah, what a moment allowing. That is so terrible.  Well for him and he sat up there and cried with no tears. If I'd only white people did that link there? Don't be using it. She was absolutely right. I look like that that usually only comes from white people and that's crazy as he held to the same thing. She cried and I start not Nance here come from her face. So do they have less you think she's going to get some like contract or something. Here's nothing. Here's what kind of thing the girls don't want to actually  Out into the real world and they can't they can't get it done. Yeah, this don't way. Here's my thing from the jump and and like I really hate that like because it was such a Hot Topic I had to go on Instagram and see people's comments about shit and whatever the case is and I'm going to talk about this a little bit later because the black community we really need to have a talk. I mean we have we always eat that but we gotta talk to everybody every you're the best.  I mean even higher up there that too but here's the thing. So, I really am tired of people in Hollywood using this excuse how people want money from y'all. Here's like he won money. Have you been here with my thing though these days? Okay. Let's just keep it one fucking hundred these days. You don't need to latch your name onto like a celebrity like that and like a negative way to get some money from people. There's so many ways to do it. That's one two  Allegations made on the same person for so many years is not wanting people for their money. Let's just like nobody would say like if any allegations came out about Will Smith, I would be like, okay. Whoa, let's back up because that's just something he's never put himself into but I'm being still doing it's just been doing it for years. He married a 15 year like even if I didn't know the facts and I and you were trying to convince me that  Money think that shot holes love to do now is tired girls go in there grabbing post pictures and get niggas and they diems like this offering them money. So there's no no supposed to cash has been depleted. Okay, there's no reason for this whole money's like I'm tired of y'all talking about people wanting money from this person and that person and that nigga, please no money and he had fix all the  Damage that this nigga has done. There's none how the fuck does it for money. You ain't got nothing. There's no money. Like you mean that's how it went up like the money that it is is you spending it to cover your ass sir. And that's why you can't pay the things that means you have been doing nothing.  Diaby, yeah, you have not been doing see yet. Oh my God, my like just the remixes the means everything look like this only he better become an influencer, but everything has caught up and keep this same energy because I don't want it to become like a mean thing and still be like a joke. Well, that's another thing. Yeah. I don't want I'm gonna be honest here you black people really don't  Let R Kelly go and I really want to know like and someone please remind me what kind of music God he was because I missed it.  I really missed it. I didn't know he was this musical God like I did not know that I know he of course going up here is Bob said everybody like I'd I just don't get it. Like what I will say is if you yeah, I'm not going to do all this.  Like if he did something he did it and start moving. Let's move forward. I just know I despise musical Talent. Yeah, I don't care what he's making saying. It's an excuse. I mean, that's what I mean when I say it like when I say what kind of he might like there's not there's not an R Kelly song that I cannot let go of because like of these are ya know that like that song don't listen to him. I'm just saying I could definitely let go of his music his impact. The reality of the situation is ya know the way that I  I feel electric chair all the way but his impact is definitely there. I never said it was out there. I'm all think. He's not a musical God enough for me to not let go of his share. That's what I'm saying. Well, you can be a God and abstain from your religion. Your anybody have no no, no not here. Yeah.  Oh my God, I'm not doing none of it. I don't see it. Well, you never did anything yet. So it doesn't matter to me. I don't see it. I don't like it. I'm staying right here are Kelly's modern musical. God unicorn go. Anyway. Yeah, and I just I can't like nothing about the situation. I'm not going to look on his side. I'm not going to take his side. There's nothing about ya know. Nothing gobble. It's nothing ain't nobody asking you to it's nothing.  Sis, do you have some type of you? Are you yes, I like you. I want to know you have to say that I like absolutely not a lot, but I don't listen to it anymore. Yes, same that's it. Not at all. It was my defenses on it did.  - okay, so when I say he's not a musical God, I he's not.  Anyway, but that whole clip of him when he was like the music is injected. Yes, but that's what I'm saying. Like in one minute. He's he that's that's like this is what like throws me about the whole interview like he was crying victim in this interview. But like oh, yeah two years ago. He was like, it's too late. Y'all can't get me the music isn't just like what the fuck so the music is injected into the community. Like what this is. What the fuck?  Later in a lot of these such a master manipulator injected life of a community. Like he's like trying to take it away is like withdrawals for the community like yeah, he's such a master manipulator to the point where he knows what he's doing every time any allegation came out. He stepped in the Name of Love or he believed he could fly and that was just that. Yeah, and I mean, but we have a long history of doing that. Yeah me how many day on Michael Jackson tribute says all mr. Chris Brown's on.  I do know well, I think I think he's ran out of them though. I don't think yeah. No, I think he did. She go real. Yeah. We went a nigga just release some inspirational bullshit. He changed me key chains. Listen to them using dance his heart. No, it's no that's the devil Playing Tricks on Corrales. But um, yeah as we are  And Joyce when they're all so fucking dumb, they're dumb shit and they were in there. So it is Sam about threesomes and they started getting all sleek and shit and I was a bitch. That's why you're here dumbass. What the fuck? Are you talking about your relationship with an accused pedophile. What do you talk? Like, I wish girl asked them to if you're not into music and if you don't want to do music, how did it go? How did this happen? Like when she sat there said oh my  Pants lied about my age. So are you basically admitting to the fact that he was interested? And that's what BART Isley lighted because he said that the parents sold them like I wish girl like like and I will hide that whole right I would have said so if he if they lie about your age lied about liking track exactly place your if your age was lied about and he met you at that age that your parents lied to him about so  And he knows your real agent out so that y'all met when you were not I mean, come on now, it's like real. Yeah. No, they not exactly what happened. Yeah, not an enjoyable. And I totally believe that they possibly sold sold them to him. I told you so yes. Something is not something is not right. I was just gonna say anymore. So now so now they're trying to be holier than heard about. Yeah, you know, I don't doubt it, but the reality is in my opinion.  They need to go to jail at this you have the possession of these tapes you're humming on child porn live near two decades. That's so y'all think that one as well said like her parents wanted them to like take all believe you're a hundred. Yeah, no shit like that and not be like it's like if you were drugged shirt. Yeah, I think she has resentment towards her parents not be cut like I think it's because like our Kelly has put it in their heads. Like if your parents cared about you they wouldn't even let you be in a type of like  That's the type of yeah, but I want to put on them but to go as far as saying like like she said they like well, here's the thing when girls get in relationships with boys. Like we see it all the time with like girls get a relationship with men that they're not supposed to men will definitely get them to turn on their parents in an instant. Like that's something that we see all the time well girls right when they say they love a man they will say everything and that's not true. So many things. Yeah, so I feel like even if  So I feel like I don't think I don't know if it's true or not. But if it wasn't true and she said that just to say it I would see why I like it's not I'm definitely gonna say it's because our Kelly but I do not doubt that her parents know a lot of stuff that would probably be incriminating to them but they're not gonna say it just don't sound like there's no way like, you know, none of it does there's no way that you're going to just let your kid just go off like that and no no wait.  Thing no way they'd let it I think they probably I don't want to say they sold the her but what I will say is this well, I think maybe was like, they said, you know what that we want her to be a star whatever so they let it happen. They probably weren't as like hard on it as they should have been and then once it started to kind of like come like when she started to make me stop contacting them then they started getting a little worried but I'm almost positive. They just let her go away Helo was not okay, but I'm  I'm almost positive. They just let these girls their parents already knew what yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. Like we yeah, and like like I said, I understand right and I understand like okay, you see that he got acquitted and shit like that, but I just waited that's not beating the case because yeah, yeah. Yeah nigga what you sound like a whole fucking like  You sound like you knew you got away with murder. And now you don't want to you don't want them to interrogate your ass again, like oh, yeah, and joycelyn. She's she's obviously a robot like I would like I feel like if they interview her by herself, they could probably get her because I don't know if you saw the video of when she called her parents obviously by our Kelly's team, like making a you know a ploy to try to get it to look like she's not against her will like when the little sister was like Hey joycelyn, like she froze.  So I feel you close. Yeah, definitely. So I feel like stop. Yeah, like joycelyn is like she's under some she's obviously under our Kelly spell but I feel like she's the week. She's she just looks Luke to me like as we all is clearly the ringleader it within them to like she's the one and you can tell off of her mouth alone. You can just tell and Gail is so much better than me because I wouldn't have stood for that the way that she fucking snapped at her you can still fix.  Little now. Listen here you little bitch. What's your nah know who you are what you think this that? It's not at the right time. Not our Kelly. Okay, bitch. I could I will be I will beat you put my heel so far down your throat bitch. You gonna fucking be walking the little curious that little girl has some nerve all of this is just sad and was sad, what's even more satisfied that it's still being questioned. Like people are still questioning this whole situation and it's like how its right.  Eating out phase everything, but he's going to jail.  Exclamation. Oh, he's yeah, that's why I like I love like all these opinions and such but they all don't matter you want to know why he wanted you guys are going to jail bitch went to jail because you can go in and out as much as you please. However, many people you want to pay for you to go in and out of jail, you got all of that. But when that trial comes this baby boy,  It's no. Yeah, there's no way around it. That's why I want child like anybody's whole thing. Like she comes back tenfold and up it at the worst time to like this is obviously got like whoever is in jail. This is somebody in the universe obviously fucking with him right now at this point because the nigga is literally in and out of jail every other week.  And then they got that whole new sex tape that came out which I was you're asking about they have a whole new sexy which his team says, it's like they're like, it's like Distortion Like editing Distortion fucking with it to make it look like it's him. I said hell no y'all niggas is really on the shits.  Goodbye, Robert. Bye Alcatraz. Bitch will reopen it's just going down and that's the case that close next block. Yeah, you bitches defending and busting his ass out and then lady can't have that much money to be busting him out of jail and shit like every time it's a new bitch though.  Everything I want to know who the first of all for you and I wanted to care a daycare and Rosana be set up in there and bail his ass out. Somebody need to look into that because she could be coming in there touching the ground went around there with the little chilled all my God girl like some cute shit to them like, oh no no, no, no, no. No, so they need to look into.  Keep an eye out for that bitch. And then we need the ID of the new beach. We do we need we need all that information. Yeah, so somebody can see any it is because what the fuck y'all What whose Auntie is getting him out? Whoo-hoo. What's wrong with the fucking wig that go to the side? Okay one. Yeah. I know. It's one of your grandma's it has relied on the only ones that still defend that man.  I don't get it. I don't get it and I'm tired. But like I said, you're going to jail case closed next case. So those fucking um, I am going to talk about hmm, Miss Nicole Mirage. There's anger don't touch the subject. Yeah, that's a start.  I love her so much and she was so beautiful. She's another one though. I think the karma came back came back to my cuz I ain't no damn reason why he had all the yeah, she did but when she had that bitch locked up backstage, I mean, it's clear came back. Dish where did  Like melody was recollecting herself. Oh my God probably beat her ass and had like a breakdown and you know, Nicole Disney very The Show Must Go On but  I think Melody had to like collect her legs her cell I mean cause she was the one doing all the she like, okay. Oh my God, what about anyways, but back to Nicole Nicole Mirage see, you know, she's on her European leg of her tour and it's kind of amazing like I don't like, I mean, we don't think Lou he seemed the IKEA furniture.  Furniture with the wheels. It's really weird and then at some point she was working on some of the failures and she's broke. All right, kiddo ass shit. Everything looks really just the wrong together. And yeah, I looked at that situation where it's like making up her body and shit and it looked exactly like the video for how many licks by look him. It's like me because the videos for the tours are great like the  You will work as far as the videos and stuff are really got it's just really weird to me everything seems kind of throwing up because there's no theme like she has those weird transitions when got transitioning yet girl, because I remember me and my friends went to go see her and don't get me started. Don't knock him started. Please don't fucking get me started. The the archetype of the direction is not but I saw it when like it was first.  First first like coming out. So I was like, okay seenu it's cool. But like she was doing it for what? What did you see? You saw pink print right? Yeah. Yeah you was doing it for pink praying and I see some of the problems like there's no growth. And in fact, I feel like she moves less back. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is bad. This is yeah, like like like the ugly and it's  Like it just all looks really weird and haphazard and thrown together. There's no grandness about it. It just really seems a mature enough in the way that it looks but anyway the shit she canceled one one concert. I went to was it I think it was maybe last week I believe know. Yeah. Well, I think it was like, oh wait you mean the first one? Yeah, the  First one hmm. The first person was like yeah. Yeah last week or so and now this one she canceled again in France and it's for the same issue and the issue is very weird to me. I'm going to say, okay. Go ahead. Yeah, they say they are saying that she said when she said her people out there and shit that there's enough there wasn't enough energy.  Electricity to pull off the show and that happened twice. So what's going on where your people are not looking she said she's never the place that so she said like she's never been because here's the thing at first I was like, okay now she's just like not selling enough tickets. So that's why she didn't do it. Some people are saying that is why for the second one, too. She said she's never been to those places. So like I guess they date,  Oh, they underestimated. I mean they overestimated what the building can handle am I gonna say that I don't believe her she can potentially be lying but I will say it it sounds it could be valid to because I can find ssibly because I mean like if I but when you have people going to look but I feel like yeah, but I feel like you're Nikki goddamn Minaj like there's no way to tell me but I don't know there's this.  Said in her video and she made a lot of sense to like there's there's so many artists who have technical difficulties and we always just assumed that like, they're not selling enough. But but then again to what I'm also in my head, I also think like but what are you doing girl? Max is two for one for right now, but here's my thing. What are you doing on your show? That's that it's not like the Drake and the Travis Scott to our we're like you have a whole last fucking amusement park on your stage when I guess team are right. It's not that you literally have scream. So I just want to  You know, what energy is there any will not draw is like maybe it's not it's not that I think it has to deal with like the European likes up. Their electric laws are different. So like the amount of there, but that's why I'm saying you look into that stuff before you go. I feel like everybody with any Common Sense know any kind of culture or knowledge. I don't know. No, I mean, yeah, I don't know about that. I don't because I lot of from what I've seen I don't watch too much of it. But from what I'm thinking, you know, like a lot of people from my ID.  Like light shows like she had whole Graphics, you know, I mean like but I don't know. I'm just myself that I don't know why you haven't that mean difficulties I agreed right? What's going on here? Like you don't know something for something taking the ball late. That's what I'm saying. That's all.  Download I'll make sense to me now.  Because you know when you think about electric laws and shit.  And my thing is if you actually have to adjust for things like I was going to say and if you know that you have these these you know that they're like yeah like you would modify the show. Yeah. Yeah, that's the lack of preparation that comes in. Like, how did you really falling apart on the stage while you working on it and shit yikes? Yeah, what's going on? Maybe maybe instead of beefing with card? You should have really been preparing for her to work like  Know if the damn radio show every day. I'm weak at this point. That's that just what have been your best bet sister girl. Yeah, but my whole my thing is what happened was the Scandal about it was that it was a second time and then the people started booing. They were stolen shit at the stage bitch say hey, look it was  These people before they guys are you gonna are you gonna are you dumb that that and are you gonna fuck you in like, I don't know bars, like give me like my money back for the gas that I spent. I think what she said that she's gonna do another one. I think she said that she's gonna come back to the places. Yes. So not Molly's. Yes. I'm like what Sean asked up bitch. I'll give you your money back when I'm coming back. Okay.  It's really long. This is not my lazy ass bitch. I will catch that boy y'all back okay to the booing the people on the floor Beach. So these the hardcore fans, they don't want to accept that. You know, they they thought it cheering cardi B, you know, there were like car thief only be called going.  Now, you know damn well how vital appropriation I know deaf nigrum location, but ya know that it was like a really crazy sight to see coz it's like weird because we see me when he's like flopping around and B2K is like killing it. Okay. What good is fun? I just saw. Yeah, they look great. Yeah out of the fucking floor and they look.  Great, they look when they they really put their time like you can get them niggas really pulled it together. I'm very happy for them. Oh my God, because I wasn't expecting a yeah.  So we thought that they were gonna be like those boots Fifth Harmony Clips. Oh girl and I cannot stress this enough Clark. Yeah. No, I thought that was gonna be a mess but they are really pulling it together. I'm hungry because I even see him. I'm going on tour.  I don't want in Vogue and shit. No don't wanna definitely don't want it's okay. I don't like it, but I'm see Hammer. I meant no, he's headlining but he's going with in Vogue and a whole bunch of other 90s blowing a steeple old handsome. I would be no I won't be going to go see the people. Honestly, I would probably leave but for MC Hammer came close. I am not Too Legit to Quit.  There's only like two songs. I don't know what you want exactly how the fuck you been in line with two and you've only got his head. We don't know anything else and I know nobody else knows anything for you. How many times can you perform can't touch this? Goodbye. You can't touch this without consent at least. I know. Yeah God I hate paying back in and then yeah. Anyways, I'm so bad.  Nikki Nikki Nikki, Nikki Manish. Um, yeah. So what's going on with y'all what y'all want to talk about then? I mean I got one last thing it's going to be really really quick. You know, I saw that, you know was just strolling down the steel or whatever and I saw I saw the what timeline the CLD. Oh, oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I thought you said DL. I said who?  Anyways, baby, um, so I'll scroll through the sealed lie and you're going to manage your motherfucking business in this is motherfucking story. Thank you. So it's real quick. We know that cops ain't shit never will be shit won't be shit wasn't shit. But there was this teenage boy that was trying to just run away the nigga stole a boat crashed the boat drowned because the cops was like, well, you stole the boat. So we just gonna watch you drown and  he drowned and that's that's garbage. Even if you did commit a crime, you're not supposed to let people now let it be a black company white boy than it would have been tiki torch. Oh America would have been he is the heart of the why we want this we all that bullshit. We want his badge. We want his we want to take this pancake and or service  Could you people why can't you but since I'm like that went on when - I knew you really already know. She's so funny. That is exactly how it sounds just like a chicken clucking. Yeah. No, but they saw all that bullshit and and when it's stuff like this, they'll try to just make the black person seemed like such a  I mean he was a criminal but they but I mean there's a Nike like come on. Yeah, you see a person drowning you help them so they can at least make it to court. All right, like that's you just being a judge and allowing them to die. Right? That's terrible - it is terrible like how white do you have to be to watch somebody motherfucking like you could have done because his breath back and then arrest.  That's like you put on be having a heart. That's the least you could have done. I love my God. Like how do you like sleep it? Oh girl what the fun know and they like and like really think about that some shit about them. They go they done did something illegal and shit in the pan right and fuck some shit up ahead and take him before he was still a toothbrush from CBS when he was a fetus lock him up exactly.  That's wack bro out that is so if my that's why when people talk about oh not all cops are bad point me to the ones that are the ones that cause then I would like the ones who who do who do do the bad things. They don't be worried because they already know that people might are gonna know anyways, can I say anything right? The good ones are the ones that would be stepping up and saying some shit is wrong right? Never do that never so even in the midst of all of  There's good cops to I'd never know. They just accomplished this nigga never seen it. That's whack. Like, I just our justice system need a justice system because everybody didn't like they need to knock a hole in that bitch and just start all the way over all the way. Maybe North Korea did have the right idea must say hey, wait a minute.  And not even one of the light skinned ones. I'll bet you're black. Maybe pad barks, right? Okay, electricity blackish it. Oh my God, but what I'll miss that is actually terrible still have that money got no damn good news this week. Yeah, that's wacky and even that's not good because it's like there's this  Long to get here on this long it took to Generations. Basically. Yeah, and it's only arts and I feel like it's just are like because you know, if it was up to our the niggas who grew up with him, he wouldn't have gone. He won't be going nowhere. Yeah, they would just leave that to be you know, that's his business right going on trash. No bitch that's against the law. What in the fuck fuckity fuck that's the thing a lot of them. They don't even view it as crime. They view it as  Business personal business, right? So this is a crime. It's a whole crime. She's Christ that don't make no thing. No can I'm American in to go to jail America need to go to jail the whole America like you got people you got ice agents and fucking you got the government like literally sexually molesting little kids and their detainment. I don't understand like what the fuck is going on. How are y'all?  Care about children. They don't care about kids I learned that was they don't care about everybody try to they don't try to make it seem like they were kids. They didn't give a shit about the not know we would have seen some type of gun logged in place, but they even don't care about the white kids don't like it either because I mean, I'm not about to sit here and defend nobody with the whole Bri situation, but the fact is they don't care about pretty be out here getting away with it. They just don't care about kids when it comes to the white man.  Kids don't matter nothing matters is if it ain't a white man, nothing bad could do whatever they want. But I guess that's it and girl let me tell you it's a girl and he rolled here. Uh-huh girl. Let me tell you right now. Let's get into the queen of the week.

They like scrap the supposed remix. I don't know. But yeah, it's just her what the fuck? Yeah. I don't see I don't see the video is the remix thing how no child but it's her a rumor. Well, it wasn't because we they thought they heard Cardis voice and like I don't know. I think I don't know like cause I don't know they took that shit they ran with it and I got my hopes up and up. Yeah, I'm so sick.  This is bullshit. Either a pair of the video was boring. Yeah, I mean it wasn't like the it wasn't like some like it. Well the thing is that she ain't gonna be boring anyways, because you was expecting to see carty and look him and I don't think I will not see that so I'm very upset. That's some bullshit. I like seeing Mariah Carey with rappers those we have best song all the time all the time. Yeah. She be like shoot a nigga up and  Bitch, bitch. So yes, I was the queen of the week. Well hmm. I am this is sense doing all by the way. All right. Stop degrading a queen.

Let me just start off by saying if you don't know her her, you know her I don't it's not still hurt fuck. I'm just a really excited anyways, damn bitch. Sorry. So the first time that I seen her and unknowingly I didn't obviously didn't know who she was was in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World which I've checked.

He's so perfect a white man of color, but this is not about him you go edit that and God Pilgrim was really good. No, sir. Anyways, so I just really wanted to say that Brie Larson 8  That fucking roll. I'm not going to compare to Wonder Woman because that's not what this is about. Although Brie Larson fans. Wait, I will say Gal Gadot is a Zionist and Brie Larson is not in that automatically put some like leagues ahead. That's another story for another day free Palestine. Secondly Captain Marvel Captain Marvel how you know everybody pronounce this but it's really Marvel if you did not see that free promo, but if y'all didn't see it, you need to go see it.

No, you know Disney got the CGI game on lock period oh, oh they snatch my sis up snatched him the fuck up. I wanted to also say that it was it was great seeing Bree advocate for Asian women AKA Scarlett Johansson at the end credits. Wait, it was yeah. Yeah. It was CK know people remember  When she did the Ghost in the Shell movie and it was supposed to be an Asian person, but they gave it to Scarlett Johansson and it flopped.  That's what happened. That's what that's what it's running. It's running meme bad Charlie Joe his knowledge of hands. Yeah Bayesian know I don't know but it was really good like a genuinely the movie generated backlash by White Star Wars Star Wars loving the basically the reverse anime niggas like white man babies basically and they were like, oh we're going to boycott it. We're gonna cancel it. It's to sjw which if you watch the movie and was literally no,  That like the movie was written so fucking perfectly in the movie. She also had a black best friend like it was written. So well think about Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman wasn't even like yeah. No it was like if they know so it was written so fucking good. It was like, oh my God and like her best friend in the movie like they wrote it so well to the point where you thought they were like dating it was like damn like these bitches work.  I don't know I'ma just say yeah, I gotta see that shit like Brie Larson had I'm gonna go shoot next weekend that shit. I'm not going to wait. I'm happy for her. That's fine.

I didn't know what to do because I was just like this is not happening like this.  They work doing what set up a show to talk. They were doing what they they wish that you know, he was doing what they wish they could do because okay. Yeah, he didn't give us not man.

So those are you gonna just discuss how want to talk? I'm gonna pull. Mr. Nick Cannon up to the podium and knocks. Yes, we are.  And already she said he understood where I was coming from. So we're going to have another discussion. Mr. Nick Cannon. This week is dumbass posted on his Instagram. Hey, y'all. What time does surviving Harvey Weinstein? Come on?  His caption said was just wondering.  Let me tell y'all something and let me tell you what I'm sick of y'all niggas doing we know how to multitask and if you black people actually paid attention. There's a documentary about Harvey Weinstein. I know y'all didn't watch but there is a little different because he's a producer now Kelly is a thing. Yeah that captivated a Holcomb you like there's a difference between there's a reason why the Hollywood in Frank, so it's not going to get as much attention, but there's multiple ones out.  The right now there was one that came out in 2017. Yeah, there's one that came out in 28 and it's not him like Hollywood, please matter of fact Harvey got jilted Harvey got prosecuted before Arquette like wave of yeah, like what it's called. That's why there's no mute wine thing because it was me to be period I mean how y'all doing man, but I'm just coming along the rocky just right.  Like everybody like I'm tired of y'all doing this if we know how to multitask like just because somebody's black and you don't equate because then there's no further along the dark alley. Oh, yes. He's like, I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not I'm not have not jail. He got me. He don't got booted out of his own from your buddies bailing him out. Okay, like nobody's touching. Mr. Weinstein. Like I'm really sick of y'all niggas doing that like we can all take that just because a white man does it to y'all?  Pass. Is that how bad does someone with the same privileges as white man? It seems like yeah, because that's all y'all do every time somebody says every time something happens person. It's always like no it's not because of her. So y'all want the period it's a crime or Kylie's disgusting and so is Harvey  and then I don't even like slinging crack on the like and Nick Cannon. You've really pissed me off because here's my other than even I know y'all don't want to touch it. I don't care. I'm gonna touch it. I know for y'all. The Michael Jackson thing is a situation that nobody wants to touch right now, I guess but listen here when he was alive, you're always dragging him, right? So stop it five. Like I really want y'all to stop like we're going to it's going to be brought up again. This is something that is it's just an all Legos  Bringing up FBI shit like the FBI don't be lying. Okay, look at how far down are Kelly guy that nigga's Track Running the English fucking boy Michael so much. He had even more reach than our Kelly. So, who knows when that nigga could have Michael Jackson knew everybody and could do anything and any point in time and yeah as his heart desires anyway that nigga had no  Friction none now FBI people be crooked as fuck and passionately had enough money to pay all kind of people off and then his sister even spoke out about him in 1993. Now what I'm gonna say is my mind is continuously doing changes with this Michael Jackson thing. I like it go back and forth because there's so many sides. Yeah bit and and like one minute. I feel like he did it and then the next minute I'm like Wade Robson is fucking lying it would be  Well, that's the thing. I don't know if I believe those particular boys. That's my name. Welcome back to yeah, but even got to stop this shit like blackest. I don't know what it is with black people and this is what I'm to I'm too gay to care about don't have this break some shit have yeah, but that's not our but that doesn't mean that we have to disregard everything that y'all niggas do. Yeah, I'm not doing it. I'm not I'm not disregarding everything because  what the fuck's so just because a white man, just just because a priest race, you know, molest little kids and a black man does it because we not supposed to talk about I got to let it go we've talked about our Kelly. Hey, so once again, it's a big difference in like the the scope of it all like they don't do it right in front of our eyes the way that our Kelly did nobody is able to do it in the way that our Kelly did so that's why everybody's eyes are  This because it's been on the eyes of been on the whole time right tell our Kelly did it and eyes were on him and all he did was put out hits that everybody sang along because all you need to do because that is instead of been when they win. Alia parents went.  To go get that marriage and old that should have been that they should have been him outside with the police because what the fuck because what the fuck what the fuck and and then if that's not a lot but it says a lot about the parent like black people like just in general because let's be real even the parents in all of these situations. There's some type of thing where it's like it's almost like they'll put a slight their kids at risk.  To keep the black man from like getting in some type of trouble because there's no way that you can tell me the parents also because of him they wanted to put their child in his position and be like this is going to be different and the right right prove everybody because let me tell you something Becky Tanya Samantha Josephine her parents would never who are parents whenever they're not save on their gas. They're not saving the white man who liked if some if a white woman knew.  Ooh that the priest was like a rapist or whatever. She would not dare. Let her child step near foot anything yet. I was there's no saving Lyle you get your ass over here. No, there was no stealing is we're not doing that. Yeah, there's no saving nothing your remember that white lady on Snapchat when her daughter was like I am from and she got on her Snapchat is like  I'm telling all of your fucking mother's that's what I meant. This is a motherfucking felony. Felony. You're listening to you know, say there's no amount of money. I'm not saying every black parent is like that but I feel like there's this mentality that we gotta save the black man. So even that they knew our Kelly was doing what he was doing. You know what maybe some money can can like help the situation like if he's giving me money, I won't say but it's like no that's like literally are Kelly Michael Jackson on  All of them they give y'all music and for that y'all just feel like we gotta save we have to they give us hits, you know, cookout Bops. We gotta save them and it has to stop like we can multitask y'all because if our killer was doing this to a bunch of little boys, it would not be the same story. It's like I told you I remember that sweet I start where the boy was like as long as he wasn't doing no gay shit. It's okay. It's okay. It's true. But it's true. Are you serious? Yes, very they're very much anyway.  That people rate black girls. It has over of course just just run them over and rape them while they did and it's an excuse so  It's an excuse it so maybe he didn't know she was dead. Like it's something I know like that damn that video of that girl that got like yeah, thanks. Look. I know. She didn't even look coherent enough. Why would that even satisfy you?  Y'all need help you don't just I really just want y'all to say you don't give a shit about black girls so we could still be honest. We could just move forward and leave y'all niggas. But yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she asked so we can just move forward and help or just say yeah, I don't want you know, you don't want the black man to go down because we don't have that many, please just tell the truth. Just tell the truth because you can't be sitting here denying. That's it. Just tell the truth. That's all I'm asking how to do.  That's it. Stop bringing up. Damn Harvey Weinstein. He getting his yes, and he's gonna get his it doesn't matter what y'all think because the white girls of Hollywood are not getting off his neck. Oh, yeah. I know that shit is not copy the real enough, but that's the thing black women they get they can't get together because some of them believe in some of them think it's a lie, and it's like how would y'all feel if y'all had a situation like a Bill Cosby or in our Kelly? And the first thing people say is over?  If you're lying, of course, like people love to ask why did it take so long because of people like y'all right y'all question is so why would I come out and say something? I don't even believe me.  Yeah, well like make it makes when they deezy it's just all in part because yes, he's coming in droves because one always gives enough friction to the other one period That's why it always comes in droves and they try to twist that into this idea that it's a Witch Hunt when in actuality is just liking of events monteux Bill Cosby this happen to Bill Cosby because he was trying to buy NBC he was girl, but nobody knew anything about that. No, he wasn't.  Never heard no shit like that. And even if that was the case, we would have been her some shit like that that we hear he held up by that shit until after all this started happening. So that sounds like a lie. First of all, I like Bill Cosby again got away with this for years. So if art if NBC was like the Tipping Point it's deserved. Sorry, like hey aside from that. It's a whole disposition and that motherfucker said that he did.  Thank you. And I said my lady got up and she went and he said that he thought everything was okay because she didn't say anything. That's just about he gave her money period  Bottom line and she didn't say nothing to him. I want you to stop it. I really do cuz a nigga this ain't nothing ain't nothing ain't not that is gonna make me defend the black hand nothing like I'm not doing it no more and I want y'all this exhaust. It's very exhausting because when it comes back around my faggot ass and getting no type of Defense from them, that's that of that  Um, right. I want you to stop supporting bullshit Yes No More Lies We can multitask if you're a fucking fell in your felon if your rapist your rapist and that's even or is she here are the 15 year old girl, that's all we needed and you know, it's true because they could be proven and it's already but I don't care what it is. We had they got pictures of the license. I don't care. Fuck what it is. You're done that way. So yeah, that's it.  I think that's it. Right. Yeah, it was a good time. It was a good time.

You're listening to episode 9 of David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast each week. You'll hear from me David Olson etske of the shitty Spears.com and me knowledge to do re the Superfund co-host as we'll discuss everything young people should be talking about or already talked about but you know in the lady and I were talking about a super-fun party we got to go to last night. Yeah. It was fun. It was fun. We saw Mabel. We saw Jax Jones some love Islanders tattoo fixes my drama. It was such a fun party because a couple episodes ago I mentioned Faster a party I got to go to which was a similar type of night to this but it went so much better. It was a bit older of a crowd than like the leading eyes age. Yeah, but everyone just a lot more like relax. No one felt snobby, right? No, not all everyone was super friendly, but what shook me a little bit was you like, you know, what like this isn't that fun? Let's go was like, you know what you're right 10 p.m. Let's peace out the event doesn't close for another two hours. But a lot of people quite look like leaving like yeah, I'm gonna head home on your story an hour later was you in a pub for someone's birthday.  T yeah, I said how about infant birthday drinks? It was my mates 21st, you know, I had to just pop my head how long were therefore not all night that he actually went to Canada lands. I like went after that one drink and went home girl. I'm judging you a little bit.  Stay tuned to David's out for a good time Spotify original podcast because later on we've got a music segment. David's pop some bangers and the lady we've got some choices on it today. It is going to be popping. We've also got a from the inbox with the question the lady and I haven't really handled before so it will be interesting to see how we go over this. We've also gone interview with scottysire. But first, let's jump into this a Spotify original podcast. This segment is all about cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation the lady. Do you know the difference between the two  Is it when some part of a culture is being exploited and an appreciation is like an appreciation of culture. This is really shit close enough. That's a culture of cultural appropriation when it's being exploited often but not always for financial gain. Yes, but cultural appreciation is when it's being utilized to celebrate and show your love and appreciation of that culture. Do you think they sort of converging to one at times? I think it depends on who's doing it, I think.  Like fashion brands man, like they usually take the piss a little bit with Black Culture, but I can see how some people be like, oh it's a celebration of shit. But I also understands now, it's a bit of a piss-take. I think it often depends because sometimes you'll see a model or something like IG body whose like white and I was home. She has like dreads or locks or like an afro, and that's it. It's just a photo of that and then the cash will be like loving summer and it's like clearly she just like is using that culture and that she like feels good herself, but one probably  he doesn't know anything about it and who is just using it for those extra like see what I mean with stuff like that it nice me so much because like locks and dreads and like just like black hair in general, like people always slander it and call it like Untamed or it's unkempt and then it suddenly seen as fashionable when the model has it. So it's just kind of like can't win here. So for viewers who've seen the photo for this episode or photos for our past episodes now, he's had a similar hairstyle over the past couple of weeks lady. How would you describe your hair?  Hasn't commented that the minute so how would you feel if a white girl in your class had cornrows a die roll? I'll just keep it moving. You won't discuss it with her. No way man. I felt there to scream. I think this is probably a thing as a white guy. It's probably a bit of like a problematic of you. But I think that absolutely I roll over it. Yeah, but I think there's so many people that like make it a big beef and like conversation when one of my biggest things is always like if the biggest thing that's pissed you off in your day is seeing a white girl with cornrows.  You've probably had a pretty good day actually and it's just a thought that like people are never going to stop doing it. Not not saying that like we should we shouldn't ever like speak against it but that people are just never going to stop doing it. So why should I just waste my breath on someone that's minor? No shade. I remember during my induction to University. We had discussion of different modules and one of them was about cultural appropriation and we were each given different examples and we had to decide whether or not it was culture appropriation and the example my group got was Beyonce in the Coldplay video where she was wearing a bindi.  Like all these things and my group decided that it was cultural appropriation and then literally halfway through talking a girl another group says no, it's not and we said why and she said because Beyoncé is black and so she can't like steel other cultures and we said yeah, but she's not Indian. Hmm and she's taking something from Indian culture and using it to like not appreciate the culture. She's just doing it for music We need to look bomb as hell. So what do you think? I'm do you think a 50? Mm? So do you think not even be able to do you think ethnic?  She is can culturally appropriate other ethnic minorities. I think they can because it's not their own culture. I think they can but I kind of feel like it can also be seen as an appreciation as well. I don't know. I feel like the line is a blind Devil's Advocate. Yeah, so why would it be appreciation if a black girl were a kimono but if a white girl wore dashiki and be appropriation actually dead, huh? I think it works both ways. I think if it's not your own culture then your appropriating but there is a level of appreciation. But again, it works both ways. So service have shown that people  I love seeing their culture reflected on a global scale oftentimes. This is especially prevalent in many Asian cultures. Particularly, Japan South Korea India where they've done surveys nationally and they pulled in results such as one Japanese man, who told the survey taker that Japanese people love seeing their culture shown on screen or in meteor and photos because it adds to their culture rather than takes it away. It makes it you know carry on the history because if you don't keep passing it on and carrying it on it dies out. What do you think of that? It is a continuation of Legacy, but maybe not in the way that it  was originally meant to come out and they're that came out as and all and a few other dresses and meant to be worn for certain occasions and you have people wearing it on the daily. So it's a way of still continuing stuff but it's not always in the best of light. I think the thing is it's always gonna be person by person not just culture my culture. Yeah. So you might for example think a white girl can never wear a dashiki and we have some other black girls. She's like, I'd love a white girl into shaky like keep the culture going whenever I've seen a white girl in  Saw of African light dressing is always been because she's getting married to someone who is from that culture. So I get it but like if it's just someone that's just wearing it to school. I'd be like, no, that's not right. And what are you trying to do is cultural appropriation just about race though. Can we see examples of it regarding things like sexuality or queer culture being taken? I wish I knew more on this queer culture. What is it? The thing is, I know we mentioned this in our a black episode about it being sort of mixed in with Black Culture things like voguing.  Things like slang fashion choices interest of for example, like drag culture. Like there's a lot of like things called bio Queens at the minute, which is cisgender women who do drag makeup and will wear like a drag outfit and do drag shows drag stems from a Shakespeare term, which was an initialism for dressed as a girl but they are dressing as a girl. There are ready girls. I always find not really weird because I know a few girls not friends with them there that I like very  Paul's Drag Race, but also like they love going out like that and I love dressing up like that and I kind of feel like not that it's stealing but it's kind of like drag is really important and it's doing so many positive things and just for someone like one of the girls that I know she's like straight and she does she does drag makeup all the time and I'm like she does support the community, but I kind of just see it as like a what you're doing does not have as much of an impact as it does when a man  Does the same you know like a few episodes ago? We talked to William about it and he talked about a contestant called peppermint who was trans and she was allowed on the show, but it was very early on in her transition. And so it's about like at what point could let see a female go on the show. Is it fair to have someone who has to talk and like do full face makeup and exaggerate all their features to look more feminine against, you know, a woman who doesn't have to talk and doesn't have to pad dude. I mean, yeah,  I think it's when people actually start to like women actually start to perform as drag queens and make that money. Yeah, I think it's just a bit unfair when you start to make a career out of it as a woman, but then to play like Devil's Advocate. What about like when that just be saying like it's a sex it's a career then saying like, oh women can't do this, but manly Han I think it's different because the men that partake in Drag and that whole drag culture, they're not straight. But then wait a minute. Does it matter if it's yours?  Straight or gay. What do you think that is cultural appropriation though? Like you think that is still even though it's not a like a race. It is a culture that is taking away from hmm. I think it and in this case profiting off of yeah, and I think it is a little bit. Yeah, what would you say? No, I'd say yeah. Yeah David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. So no lady. When did he finish school 2016?  What were your favorite parts of school my friends? I always talk about my friends with her, but my friends rate in The Memories We had in there and like school for me was a time of like House Parties. It was the love of God has probably yeah and all sorts of stuff another the house. What did your friends ever dip it and do it at a house party like lychee dip it and do it. May I can't tell the story. So did you have sex education at school which could have maybe prevented that happening? We did have sex education at school, but it was not in high school.  High School it was in primary school and after that it was not touched on so I went to a few schools but the school that I was at for the longest period we had mandatory sex education what's called health class. But by the time I joined that school it was basically just sex ed once a week it covered everything from you know, like drink-driving and other topics like that but was mostly just sex education. We did things like the glitter game where two people put their hands in a bag of glitter and then go around the room. So first I'll shake hands with one person and then that person shakes hands with another special glitter event representing an STD. So, how can you spread from person?  Person to person and I remember the funny part of that was two guys to know the game was about they joined the class late and they shook hands and then the teacher was like after explaining what is boundary was like, oh gross and then she was like, well, no because you know, you might shake hands with someone who shook hands with a girl but then you shake hands with a guy like this people who are bisexual, you know, they might catch me from one gender then passed on to another like it works both ways. Just like you can't catch something just because it's from someone of the same gender. Yeah. That was something like a shook moment of like, oh so working like gay sex education as well.  So our experiences of sex education schools, you know, yours is more than mine. I had it once a week but should they might honestly sex education in my light years of Academia has been very poor one for the fact that I think it's because I went to like kind of religiously based schools and the times that we did learn about sex. We did not touch on anything to do with gay sex, and we never touched on female masturbation. We only spoke about male so it's pretty pretty awesome male masturbation.  Yeah, they talked about co-ed. Was it Boys and Girls Together? Yeah, it was all of us in one class and they would talk about like bonus and what boys do but not once ever spoke about like girls or anything anything like that. And then when I got to Catholic school, which is my secondary school all we talked about was periods and we did not land on contraception because as you know Catholicism is against contraception. I only know what I know from the books that I've read. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Serious eye.  If I wasn't a book reader, I'd be out here struggling. Well, you know in the UK compulsory relationships and sex education is delayed until 2020 your school didn't have to teach you about sex and at all. It's not compulsory. They do have to teach about puberty but things like consent what a healthy relationship looks like alternatives to contraception. They don't have to discuss that at all. All that is only be compulsory from 2020. That's mad. How does your brother my brother is going on eight? Yeah, so he'll probably one of the first Generations that has a  Poultry sex education and hopefully it's fair this time. I think it's gonna be a lot more in depth because like the teen pregnancy rates are like disgustingly high like it's yours are shaking your head. They can't see it home but big time. Yeah, they are like the amount of girls and know from my like secondary school that I've got babies now and like I've only just turned 20 this year. Not that I'm judging or anything, but I'm just like, oh my God, this is the thing. I want to be clear. Yeah having a baby's a teenager is not a bad thing. Now the difference is between people who planner or in a healthy relationship.  On it and people who just dip it into it at a party and then they're pregnant and it was unexpected the not ready for it. And that's when it's more like something like such sex education could have prevented this. Yeah, so if like their own education, which is failing them, yeah and that affects them further in life because you know, they weren't taught in school about proper contraception. Yeah, another going to miss more parts of school to deal with her pregnancy and have a baby. So it's just a cycle of like shit. Yeah work out. What do you think sex ed should require? I think it should start off with consent.  Then it should go into multiple sexualities and then it should go into what boys go through what girls go through. I think it should just cover things surrounding relationships. Do you think that the fact the us only has eight states as of 2018 that require explanations of concerned like as part of the sex education doing that's part of the reason why we hear so many horror stories coming from the US about like lack of consent awareness and you know, like a horrible like fraternity sorority stories and things like that. I think people just assume like  With regards to like sex that like people already know to be consensual, but I think it's a thing of like no you actually have to teach these people like it's not fair. You actually have to teach people to consent and to say yes or no because you know, we have a lot of this is like a heavy topic but have you ever had any issues with concerns? Like have you ever seen any guys like you like you boy? Clearly you didn't get taught anything in school even like in the club like we've entered it before I can stories like when guys just like think it's okay to just grab.  So the club met yeah, and what's what's the lying about it is is that I'll be like I'll say it once I'll be late are can you not please I'll be so polite and then it's a constant thing. I was like, I've said this three times and you're still doing it. It's really like what is wrong with you? Okay hypothetical you go on a date with a guy. Uh-huh. You go back to his or he goes back to yours. Hmm, and he's like, hey, let's do item X, huh. You say no and then he asked him. Hey, can we do?  Do item acts like a minute later. And you say no and then he doesn't do it. Huh? Is that but like abusive like needs to learn consent because I saw there's a tree that had like eight thousand retweets and probably buried now because every fucking tree has eight thousand retweets now but it was about this girl like beefing with a guy and is because he kept asking for a blowjob and she said no and like he didn't actually make her do one but she was like he needs to learn consent if you're asking repeatedly and that person's still say no you're still y'all are harassing that person still so  Kind of like you need to back off. It's one thing you to ask once you do not need to ask multiple times in my opinion. So whether legally barred or simply ignored the lgbtq inclusive sex education system is not available for most youth the GLS Iain, 2013 national school climate survey found that fewer than 5% of LGBT students had health classes that included positive representations of LGBT related topics. What you think about that is so for my understanding does that mean like, uh,  LGBT kids they're taught that sex is kind of like scary not something that can be fun. I like enjoyable from their sex ed classes just because it they only cover like the negative things what I think that's what the survey respondents are trying to say. So where they don't have any positive representations. So even like inbox you see like cartoons of boys and girls holding hands and I like going on dates and then when it comes to like if they even because there's so few that do with if there's even any like LGBT representation in the  Education Health classes it's from like by the way, you can get AIDS next page. It's unfair because everything comes with risks, but it's not the only thing and it's just a little bit unfair it to just focus on that. I think especially when you're growing at an age where like you're starting to get involved in stuff like this and you're like becoming more aware and your friends are doing this and that it's kind of like it's scary. It sounds scary among Millennials surveyed in 2015. Only twelve percent said their sex education classes.  Covered same-sex relationships. What do you think we can do to make that more like representative someone from the LGBT community can commit and and like speak firsthand, you know rather than someone's straight saying it but do nothing that would make it more Awkward because sex ed class especially when you're younger often like associate be like awkward and cringy John. He'll be even more Awkward to have some comment just for this one off like speaking thing. It might be people you got educate the masses in the end. I think so doing that's what would work at your school. Like if you had someone come in sir.  LGBT relationships do you think I would have actually helped? Yeah, I think it would help and also like just law books on the all just being told about it because I honestly just I was just quite sheltered in my education. So I just think anything would have helped. You know, what I just remembered. Did you get any like goody bags? No, so we got a goodie bag at the end of like our first session. Hmm and in the boy is good because the first three sessions which were like, normally the puberty ones are like the specific gender separate ones at the end of those.  Dundas everyone's we got to get a bag and in the boys bag it which is like pamphlets and leaflets and like contact numbers and then the like gift was to condoms. The girls went had two pads. Isn't that weird? Yeah girls need to Pat specially as pads are expensive, but it makes it seem like the condoms only because responsibility. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I know. A lot of girls are like don't buy condoms or don't have condoms on them because they just automatically assume a guy will always have one and it's his responsibility. I think it just I think it's just good.  Back to the whole thing of like, I'm just linking it back to me going to a Catholic School of like boys can do this girls can do that. Like I think it's kind of I think women find it kind of embarrassing and to carry condoms and also like you'll if you are a girl and you carry a condom it's going to it's going to look like a super promiscuous. Well, here's what okay, I think that you'd understand them loose leaf in your bag. Yeah. I mean fight like a cute little like the same way like girl having a little purses just for like, yeah.  Jules yeah, you can put quarters in that I mean, but I think it's just the whole thing of like looking like, oh my God, I'm so like but I've got this this and that and you won't ever know is does I always hear from so many fans the first time you buy them. That's what people do they always buy like three items and then condoms as the last item, so it'll be like a Diet Coke a tuna sweetcorn sandwich a copy of some like magazine and then condoms.  Gotta keep it like discreet. Yeah, but that doesn't just make it so obvious that it's like awkward and but if you're like a listener who is like, oh I need protection. There's two choices either you can go to like if your country is, you know wealthy then normally they will have free condoms at health clinics or hospitals. Yeah, so got go get them from there. Some schools even have them like in the like Health office or somewhere like that. And then the third option is you can always literally go on Amazon or some online shopping or in there. They'll come in a little brown box. Yeah not great for the environment that they're having to send it in.  A ball but you know No One's Gonna know you take the box to your room. Open it up. Throw it all the packaging all the receipt and stuff them in a little handbag.  David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast this week. We got a question from a Tumblr username. Jess who asked us a question. It says for David what are questions that I shouldn't ask a and Anna Brackett new gay friend and tonality water questions. I should ask a bracket new black friend. I think the biggest questions normally always some around when you first find out they're gay the question sort of fizzle out or like wind down as it goes along. Some of them are kind-hearted like oh, when did you find out? Thank you for telling me like, why do you want to tell?  Ami but while things like that there's all fine, but it's always questions. Like are you a top or a bottom which is like just like a hyper sexual question like within like making a new friend regardless of race or sexuality. Your first question isn't to them isn't like what's your favorite position dude? I mean, it's just like that's so like other questions are always like do you know so and so that's like a question. I'm sure like you got as well but just about like a black girls like, you know, so-and-so met as if as if I fucking there everyone in my everyone.  Black, you know, I'm just like like, you know Janelle Monae let's let's leave now black people also get were put into a specific category. There are there are so many different types of personalities within black people and just to like stereotype. One thing. I fucking hate is The Stereotype of like, oh you love watermelon dirt. Yeah. I'm literally like I do love watermelon, but please and what about it literally could but just not  they just do not fall into stereotypes because there's so many people that are different and also be assumption like my okay not for me because I love rap, but my cousin's hate rap. So for them if you ever ask them. Oh, so you must love Travis Scott. It would be like a strong. No on that part stuff not to ask a new black friend just don't fall into the stereotypes assume that this person is just different maybe and likes a ton of things. What's a question you've often been asked and you  My answering where are you from? You don't mind that I got some people don't like that because it feels like they think all black people look like they're from the same place. I don't mind. Where are you from but I am annoyed me when people are like, oh you look like y'all should rather be asked to where you from rather than they tell you. Oh, you look like you're from this place. Yeah, someone you look like you look like you're from Jamaica. You look like you're from Ghana. You look like you're from South Africa and I might do I really how do I really look like that. I'm from Zimbabwe man like doing  Don't lose involving. But yeah, and I'd prefer to be asked where you from. Yeah, I think when it comes to me, there's questions. I also don't mind being asked so questions. Like how did you know or questions? Like who did you first tell like what your coming-out story things like that are just like fun, like you've been asked so many times you just sort of have them ready to like roll off the tongue. Mmm. It's mostly just like the sexual questions which are like girl. I just met you jarring and and they do ask them way more than you think to be honest. I think it also  On who's asking me if it's like in the club smoking are in the person is drunk as hell and they asked something really dumb. I'll just answer it because I never go see this person again amazing will answer them now so that way they don't have to ask one of their actual friends versus if it's like a really good friend to ask him if that's what you want to know this whole time. Yeah, like I'm so like if someone asks you I'm sure like I'm said, you look like you're from blah blah blah, but they were drunk at a smokers are you'd feel really different about it than if it was one of your friends, I thought should be like do I that's I'm always like not Shook at the question. I'm kind of like do I  and I in like, how can I do a U-turn doing regardless of Hooters? I think yeah, I think it is. So for me, it's definitely different if it's a friend I'm gonna be more fun than if it's a stranger. I don't have to see you again. Yeah, true that. Well, if you have any questions that you want to know send them to me, I'll be a lot more nice about it than the lady I guess.  Are the pre-classic coming out story telling my friends one by one hoping they'd accept me are the most part they were all fine. But I was the first Al guy at my school. So it was hot gossip. So the Snowball Effect happened and then people started telling people who start telling people and gradually the whole year new so sassy young Dave decided to write a spicy little status on Facebook saying the Classic this is me deal with it. I know I took all my family off the none of them can.  It's it for my brother because I hope that he didn't come to me about his father being gay. However plot twist definitely didn't do that and went straight to my parents. They were finally accepting and I got a cheeky takeaway pizza the same night fast forward a couple years. I found out that my mom and brother had a bet on me being gay Tena and my mom just did it for the competition because she thought I was gay too. So on a whole my coming-out experience was or I can better the people.  People just don't out people it's never fun being on the other side of that. Mine tune would be Magic by B.o.B. Because if there's a bot.  Thank you so much for your call and come out. We really appreciate them you inspire us and hopefully you'll Inspire others to call in and come out with us. You can do so by visiting the shooting Spears.com and hitting us with a message or a from the inbox advice questions. But you know, it's time for David Boston bangers. Make sure to follow our playlist Davis pops bangers. It's our social playlist edited by Spotify each week with all the track's you mention or tracks we use for context. It's got some amazing songs on there ready. I've got over a hundred already. It's not tunes on.  It has got like will be a song that you like on that playlist. I know no lady Li have made it. So with full biased we will say it is full of Bob swingers. But you know, it's a Tuesday. It's time to add some new ones the lady. What are you new Tunes you're adding today with both mingers. So my first song is funky town by lip-sync. If you love disco, you will love this song. You will have had it on track. It is just a banger and it never gets old though. I next song is lemon.  By any Rd and Rihanna, this song is a barrier in the club. I pull up in the lemon in there and see if this is just your ask acidic such a good song search a good song and it I think it will always be a banger always and then my next song is White Noise by Disclosure and a lunar Jarred. I've mentioned alunageorge before she in fact was Heron. It's her and a friend Battalion of the actual thing is she is just the queen of like hypnotic. Cheers.  The felt I loved her. I love her vocals on this song and disclosure no offense, but I they will never have an album as good as settle when a fire starts to burn. Do you know if I guess I'm not allowed to the brim albums for the fire and cackle just did not hold the same amount of weight as cell and two ways. My next track is slowed down by Calvin Harris and nnamani I really  Love the song and I love no money. I'm slowly like I'm slowly but surely becoming like a certified sad. Yeah like slowly but surely I really like her and I as she released an album yet. No, she's mad I'm looking of Lies slow down, you know pops and banging all have songs. I think I haven't hated any song that she's bought out and then my last song is oh my God by Mark Ronson featuring Lily Allen this song I'm Reese got exactly what David said in.  Me school. This song was just like everything to me and I love the video and I love Lily Allen and like Mark Ronson such a good producer. So those were my five songs on to you David now David on to you like in the news channel. What's up? What's up Obama saying David, Auntie you my five songs begin with Expectations by Lauren Jauregui. So I just realized we have Normani song Add a Lauren Jauregui song on the same playlist. I mean Camilla is where Camilla is.  Taking that's where she is. They're the two best of the band aren't they? Let's be honest. Even when Camilla is still in it. There's the two powerhouses. Yeah sex with patients is great. It's you who drives me so much off and some people may be offended by this comparison, but it sounds like an Amy Winehouse 2018 track like if anyone has was still here today I could imagine this would be a song that she would release in this current like live music. I've always changing. That's exactly the next song is high horse by Kacey Musgraves a small part of me really loves country music but specifically like more of the poppy females had like Carrie Underwood Taylor Swift Mary  Morris and Kacey Musgraves is another name we can add tool is high horse. Is that Bop? The next song is high by the beach by Lana Del Rey Queen. I love it. I stand like as much David stands Halsey. I stand Lana Del Rey like big time as much as irate Beyonce man. Like I really fucking love it. And I love that song continues. Its my favorite law honest. I think no really you want and I'm gonna I'm gonna retract that statement real quick so I can relax its my favorite Lana video. Okay. Okay the videos eye contact.  But you know a couple weeks ago there was that massive unfortunate horrible while the fire that spraying through most of like Los Angeles in Malibu, California the house from the videos actually burned down and that was long as real beach house. Oh, wow. How's that? I know. The next thing I have is Houdini by Foster. The People love this album. I've mentioned this at the weird thing is I vaguely remember mentioning this on before and this song separately, but it's not on the playlist so Spotify where did it go? But this album,  Into and it's on my favorite albums of all time. This track specifically is like one of my favorites. I remember like being in a house party in this was one of the first songs. I heard I was like yo like it feels like I'm in that like high school movie. Like there's that Indie pop song playing everyone's vibin real good. So the song will always have a special place in you know, 15 year old David's heart and 21 year old David's heart. I'm so old but the fifth song the one you've been waiting for. It's part of your world by Jodi Benson, and I know this is the song that might have  A secret queer history but spoiler alert it does so it's not Jodi Benson specifically which you have this song history, but it's Hans Christian Andersen who gives it that history. So it turns out that recently a bunch of love letters were released that he wrote to an unknown male. The male has he writes the first name in the letters, but because it's no surname or any other context they don't know who it was to but it was to a guy they know that for sure and he uses mermaids as an allegory for their situation.  Out not feeling completely like you belong you're like halfway there and so people have now looked back at The Little Mermaid and know that because he wrote it and he uses mermaids as an allegory for his situation. They think Ariel and Prince Eric is meant to be like what it's like to be gay and falling in love for a straight guy. So like the way arrows half human. He's like half way to finding the right person, but he's just like not he can't compete he isn't there.  the ladies holding herself with both hands with so  You having an emotional day aren't you? Yeah, that's why I say it's just about my life. Everything's just stress, but you won't be stressed when using two part of your world. No. No, I'll be like slowly crying with a tub bed engineer. So it's well known that both Aladdin and Prince Eric are the spices of the prince world. They're the most attractive one's way better looking than Eugene from Tangles a spice named Yugi entangle. They find out that his name is Eugene after all. Sorry. I only watch good movies.  He's  You're listening to David's out for a good time with Spotify original podcast. We are here with scottysire. You obviously know him from YouTube or his music or Vine never dead in our hearts never are you excited for find a comeback Scott? Well, is it coming back? I'm not sure do you think it should come back? Um, you know, I miss fine. I hope that it comes back but I don't know how it would play out because there's so many other apps out there now that kind of used Vines short.  Form comedy method I would never be good at Vine. I'm like, I'm creative but I feel like all my humor would just be like Lele pons that humor like just the wars divides possible or the the music as the punch line where it's like a simple joke and then it ends with like a song exactly. So, you know, a lot of these, you know people that started on Vine who are musicians are now signed to you know, major labels you people like Shawn Mendes at Island Records same with Jack and Jack you have late.  Pawns of at Universal didn't amount everywhere. Yeah, they're handing them out. Just the given him to anyone and you doing it all independently. Are you happy doing this all independently, I am happy doing it independently. I wouldn't mind someone picking up the music and put money behind it. So it wasn't all me but I like doing it like this. I like keeping the money after I spend my money exactly and there's actually a lot of major artists that then we'll step away from the label there a part of and you know, that's what they  Like they like the money they're putting in is then going straight back to them rather than being divided up nine different ways. I think Drake said in one of his songs, right? It was like I don't I don't like given no percents or something like that. I can't remember what song it was but yes, we're big Drake fans here. So is there any major industry like producers writers or you know, maybe featured vocalist you'd love to work with one thing like putting it out to the universe. I'd love to do something with Twenty One Pilots or Brendon Urie or Busta Rhymes.  Our mmm, I don't know much about different producers, but I know you know I have I have a lot of musical influences and they range from all over the place. Yeah, you know, it's funny that you say Twenty One Pilots and Busta Rhymes and the same sentence because on paper they're so different. But like do you remember that soundtrack for that movie with Jared Leto? Oh, oh my God, and that was very that style of mixing together this, you know rap with, you know, people like Twenty One Pilots and that  It is like a very Niche genre by think. So John of people really enjoy. I mean the soundtrack did great your musics doing great. Are you really happy seeing how people are reacting? Yeah. I loved it. I loved it. I was able to write a bunch of songs that I thought related to you know, the people that follow me and the reactions I get are largely positive not really too many negative things. Of course, it's going directly to my built-in audience and I'm trying to expand out to more people but it's funny you say that they're your built-in audience because I found  And you through your music before I found you through like your Vlogs or so. Like I never had the Vine app. I would see Vines when they were like shared on Twitter or like re-upload it onto Instagram, which is terrible. I know but I never had the app. I like I never attached the names to the users. So I definitely seen your Vines by didn't know that they were a Scots I Irvine it was David dobrik Vlog where he was helping out with a music video shoot or recording and I remember going to your channel and hearing the song like the final product and she being so impressed, right?  Don well, that's that's good to hear. So, how do you explain the Vlog Squad to listeners? Who are you know, let's say watching YouTube but they haven't stumbled onto that side of it yet. I guess the Vlog Squad would be considered an Eclectic group of friends that do a bunch of crazy stuff on the internet like a lot of the other groups on the internet, but David did something kind of new in the whole blog world where he put together comedy sketches and called it a vlog instead of instead of just recording his life and kind of doing whatever he's doing.  The day he sets a bits it started off. He got a bunch of different people that were on Vine and put them into YouTube and it worked out it reminds me a bit of like a boy band or girl band and I know that sounds weird. I'm not like saying the Vlog Squad is equal to Fifth Harmony, but what I'm trying to say is that you know, fifth harmony, let's say they had Camila Cabello leave and it's not that she left and stop producing music. She left and jumped on her own solar train. There's people that have appeared in his content and your content and Zane Carly and Aaron who  whoever maybes content that are no longer a part of it. So the same way Bantu people jump in and out. Do you ever have those sort of boy band girl band stereotypical like fights of oh we shot this today and I want it for my Vlog because you know, I'm the one that deserves it probably AA that's fine. Typically we know who's getting what so if it's someone else's idea then they get that idea for their Channel and you know other people can be there in film that stuff.  But the person whose idea was and set it up and paid for the props and whatnot is the person who gets the post that on their Channel first and have you know the control over when other people do it. Like if Zane is shooting his big 200 flogged and he hired a production team to help film his music video and people are they're filming the behind-the-scenes. We all know. This is a nice video. We're not going to post it before him absolutely. Not typically any fights between people it's like ultimately we're all pretty respectful of the other.  Since content so we're not going to step on anyone's toes. So if you like take away YouTube and take away violence. Just take away like all the success that you've had. What do you think you would be doing now if it wasn't for all of that? Well, if I take away those things then all I have is my music. So I guess I could be a musician. Were you working on music while Vine and all that was still happening? Yeah. I was not working on music and I've never really been a musician until two and a half years ago when I made my first song with my buddy fits  Sad song but I was always kind of making jingles and change and lyrics to songs and and things like that like even on Vine some of my biggest Vines were be changing the lyrics to songs. And so music was always a big part of what I was doing, but I was it wasn't like a profession and by any means you guys have a very successful group to her. Are you interested yet and thinking like, well, I have enough songs to fill out a set list. So let's do a solo show.  Well, that's the question. Yeah, I did the group tour with David and Zane and Heath and Todd and all them and I release my album and decided to announce my own torso actually habit or it's called ruin your party tour and it starts in February. Are you gonna come to Europe at all? Not on this first or this first or is like a small around the country tour doing 400-person rooms versus the 2000 person rooms. I was doing I think us and UK YouTubers are very lucky that  that they do well in quite a few countries. So I feel like you could easily come to places like London Paris Madrid and do a sort of many International tour. I would love to do that. I know that my primary audience is us and then Canada and then like Australia even but I would love to and I get a lot of tweets from people that are in the UK and stuff like that that they're like, why aren't you doing any tour dates where I'm at and it's just because  Mostly because I'm nervous, you know, I don't want to go and try to sell something and then it not work out. I'm kind of very what do you call it? I I'm tiptoeing my way to where I need to be. It's interesting to hear someone that has 295 million views on YouTube say, well I'm tiptoeing. I don't want to be cautious. I don't wanna and then meanwhile have bad baby being like so I'ma Do a festival in Japan. Let's just see how it goes. I don't know that's kind of my brand to be a little bit insecure. So I am  I'm kind of I'm worried, you know, if I go and do something and fail scared to step out of my comfort zone but I try to like even going on stage and Performing to anyone is it's very difficult for me. I never was good at school presentations or anything like that and never thought I'd be doing what I'm doing now, so I wouldn't want to go up and do something poorly something that I really like about you and kind of like a sad thing to like about someone but if something does to me, I wouldn't take offense. If you do we'll just cut this part right out.  Spotify police flag II, you know, you've discussed mental health and anxiety and insecurities in various press or videos. You've done on YouTube. You don't really hide away from it. And the thing I find really admire about you isn't necessarily that you're so open with it because I think that's been great about our generation and recent times that everyone's really open about it. It's more that, you know to hear you talk about these insecurities or issues of public speaking, but they're from someone that we would stereotype as well if he's doing YouTube and has x amount of views'  And he looks this way which is conventionally attractive. He's like shredded with muscles. Then he shouldn't be this way, but he is and that sort of like makes me feel better because it makes me feel like to know that there's someone that again like looks so conventionally attractive and is very popular online and they are still going still struggling. Yeah makes me feel like it's all right power through. Well, I'm glad you think I'm conventionally conventionally attractive.  But yeah, no, I think that's a big thing for me as being you know, relating to the people that are watching me and that's you know, something that I have struggled with through my life, you know, like I was growing up and I you know, I have a song where I rap about Zola Prozac and Lexapro and those are the three antidepressants that I've used before and you know, I just been very anxious on my life and I like to show people that you know, you can have these insecurities and anxieties and you can still accomplish.  These things and I think that other people enjoy to see that as well. Like I'm a human being and everyone's a human being regardless of how they look you know, yeah, and I think what's really cool as well is that it's going to be a part of you and you have your coping mechanisms and you know that the same way you our viewers. It's not just there for one day of their life. It's going to be there for a while. Yeah, and I think that people on YouTube or YouTube viewers have really attached to real personalities and I've never been a fan of all the  False positivity and like every video has to be like a smile on your face and like I'm doing great right now and especially like if I'm having a bad day, I'll let him know. I'm like, I'm having a really bad day. I'm cranky. I'm irritated. I'm anxious. I'm nervous to go to this thing or that thing and just let people know that I am a human being and you know, some people try to hold himself on a pedestal like above other people and I'm not doing that. You know, I'm just like everybody else someone that's in the like Vlogs go.  Odd so to speak she's a vlog Squad adjacent and she's my favorite YouTuber of all time. I think I would pay more money for a Trisha Paytas meet and greet than I would for Beyonce meet and greet so her videos because I've been waiting for this forever like since before I was old enough to really know what she's talking about. Yeah. I've seen people like recently on like Twitter and stuff share clips of her, you know, crying on the floor or like really like going through a breakup in a bad rough way and not knowing how to  Express her feelings and people are like will take a photo like not a photo like a screencap of her crying on her kitchen floor, like in hysterics over something terrible has happened to her and they'll capture like me when my ubereats McDonald's is cold dude. I mean, yeah like and and it's funny to laugh at that and it's relatable to an extent. But like it's interesting to know when you see people in your comments or on social media discussing like mental health, especially that of your  And in that like making almost making fun of the light do you have issues with that? I don't generally have issues with that. And I think that you know, she doesn't mind it. You know, those those memes they become memes and it's like a humorous thing and I think I think she's able to you know, she has it and she posted on the internet and then when people, you know repost those clips or whatever she's she's well aware that it's going to happen and it and it happens or whatever. She she's good at rolling with the punches and she's a she's really entertaining person as well.  His skull I got in trouble once for doing a meme involving the Vlog Squad. So on my Tumblr that SHINee Spears there was three suggested videos in a row all from various Vlog Squad members and the first title I'm going to not say verbatim here because I'm not giving the exact title. But the three titles were going on our first date, let's say and it was a photo of I don't remember the exact team members were I think it might have been like Zane hijazi and toddy Smith and it was like them and like an umbrella.  Race and then the second one was our first kiss and it was Zane hijazi. And he threw us are like about to kiss and the third was were breaking up and it was them again, but like with like emojis or something on screen so I can play they were fighting and I took a screencap of those in a row and I captioned it mean every relationship basically or like something like because my Tumblr and obviously shows openly queer and lgbtq inclusive. I thought of people really find out relatable and funny, but  It is the post itself did pretty well, like I think it had like 16 thousand likes and comments but most of the comments were negative and they were people saying like why are you supporting people that are like queerbaiting so not even click baiting but queerbaiting is the for listeners who don't know that is where you will purposely create air quotes like gay content, even though you're not gay just to attract a certain audience. So there's people that say and it's a very nice bodies, but there's people that say that will only watch you.  No YouTubers like Connor Franta Tyler Oakley and then if they see a photo of let's say Toddy and Zane with the caption our first date, they'll think that they're gay YouTubers and click in so I had a lot of people like drag me saying I was like supporting bad people and I sort of like ignored and never really spawned at the issue. But you know your friends of these people and some could argue some of your, you know, video thumbnails and captions are queerbaiting. How do you feel about that issue?  Well, I never thought of it like that and I don't think that any of them ever thought of it that way either and I always thought that the way that we mess around with each other and stuff like that is positive and I would say supportive isn't the right word but like like it shows that it doesn't matter who you like or you're in love with her you're kissing or whatever like it literally doesn't matter and we don't look at it as a bad thing or anything like that. So, I don't know I just didn't  I think that they would ever be a problem. I didn't know that queerbaiting was a thing. Yeah. So queerbaiting is usually used and yeah, no lady wasn't familiar that yeah. I saw a girl feel that him with like wide eyes like what? Yeah, so it's not really that well-known of a term. It normally stems from like television and films. So it's often when like TV writers will have like two female characters have like really slow exchanges and like holding hands and like like let's say they're like about to kiss and like I love being great friends with you.  So yeah, so it's actually that's really new to me as well. I never really felt the need to apologize for that post for the exact same reason you explained. I didn't think it was titled and thumb nailed with that intention. Well, then in that respect, there's a lot more movies and stuff coming out now where you know, it features a female and female relationship or metal style through its so like are these movies a positive thing because they're showing them in a positive light.  Is it well, no, so good thing because they're queerbaiting because they know that's what people want to see. Well no soul of Simon wouldn't be considered queerbaiting because queerbaiting is so much click between the term that the video isn't about what you thought it was so full of Simon's queerbaiting it's as if they would be advertising as a movie where Simon falls in love with another guy, but then you go to sit down and see the movie you've paid your $12 and it's actually him a falling for a compliment for the female cat. Yeah, so it's about misleading the viewer. But yeah, so I have no issue that that and hopefully our listeners are bit more educated on the top of queerbaiting.  I was my most education Labs at me. We just education man. I know I'm always learning something new here. So if you guys ever need a you know, a token gay in the group, I will take the next flight out. I may have to borrow some clothes upon arrival some don't be sad shirts with your name on it. Amazing. I'm a size small. I'm working my way up to a medium hashtag gains. It is bulking season. Where's my Shake Shack? It should a building up the winter fat as we speak.  You and your girlfriend you guys are so adorable together. Like I can't even my heart. But thank you Milady and I have a lot of trouble in love like our show is not a relationship. So the funny thing is so many people that you know slide into rdms. Yeah or like approaches in person. Are they make it seem like I chose a relationship problem. So it's not we just have so many know. I know I know guys like we will answer any other question to trust me like you don't need to keep sending us relationship questions. Although I do love answering them because me and  David get a bit emotional with every single one. But give me something else out of my finally single ready to mingle Shawn Mendes. My dreams are open for a reason. Why do you think you guys have been able to sustain such a tight? Happy relationship for so long? I don't know. She's really supportive of everything that I do and I try to be supportive of everything she does. Yeah, you know, I don't know we've met it Coachella and you know the musical background there but um, but no we just kind of  We've done well together. Yeah, I don't I don't know how to explain why every guess we've had come on that's in a relationship has always said I just don't know. He just works. I'm like Sir Simon the secret I need instructions. I need like I need like if you ever seen Brooklyn Nine-Nine. No, I've seen some clips on Twitter. Oh, there's a character who has a binder for basically everything in her life, and I'm literally like I need binders from people when they giving me love advice. I feel like love advice doesn't  Really work because it's all different depending on who you are and who you're loving. Yeah, were you nervous about having you know, Kristen your girlfriend be in your Vlogs because it's sort of like you don't bring someone in your followers your viewer is fall in love with her too and then knock on wood because you guys are so cute but something happens and then she's no longer there. Do you I mean, yeah, I mean, it's definitely a thing and when I was first started dating her I was on buying I had a completely different audience where my shirt was off all the time and I was  Trying to be high commercially attractive and when I first introduced her in like an Instagram picture and then in a Vine and stuff like that people, you know, they didn't want to see that I had a girlfriend and you know, but that was okay. I was in a relationship and I was going to show it off and and then eventually the dislike of her shifted into oh my God, we love her and we love you guys together. So I'm you know, not afraid of that anymore as far as like, you know us breaking up if that ever  And you know that would suck and I don't know how my social media following would react to it would people stop liking me because they would side with her and a breakup. I don't know but that's just that's just you know, you gotta cross that bridge when you get there, I think worry about it. Well, hopefully you never have to cross that bridge but exactly if you get there. Yeah, I think the thing is that you know, when we look at the Vlog Squad and I keep using the term, I'm sure there's some of our listeners were like, what the fuck so what is the name of the group? Yeah.  Look at this group of YouTubers that are all friends and cross over into each other's videos, you know lies the cauchy people who don't want you to might be familiar with her, you know, she's been a movies. She's a Nickelodeon show, you know, David dobrik who has millions of years. I mean when they broke up it was on the cover of like newspapers in the UK and search. Yeah, and so I think the reason that the following wasn't as weird after they broke up is that they have their individual channels. Yeah, and I think the way Kristen your girlfriend as a YouTube channel is sort of  If there was people that want to keep in touch with her or see her more there's that Avenue, I think this whole question makes more sense when you know when you started she wasn't vlogging and so it's one of those things of introducing someone who then if they are no longer there. It's like they've disappeared from the internet. Like you said she does she has a YouTube channel as well. So there's that Avenue but subscribe. Yeah, subscribe to me to scottysire research me. I'm oh don't worry says at the very end plug all those socials, okay.  Okay, sometimes I like to I like to plug every three minutes in my videos. Yeah.  So it's really interesting to me is that when you guys started every now and then some of you would get invited to a movie screening, but it was just a screening to then for you guys for like plug or you know, it wasn't real like paid as an opportunity just like something fun for you guys to attend from you know, the studio especially being in LA and now it's escalated to like I heard that the weekend like kicked you out from a table and a club. So yeah, how did you hear that? David's podcast? The problem is I can't say the root Source it may have been a guru gospel.  We've been a tumblr post but from somewhere, I remember that hearing that the weekend kicked you out from a table at a club. We were sitting at a table at a nightclub and someone came up to me and said hey, I like your table. I want it and I was like what is going on? And it was just it ended up being this confusion. I had no idea who was talking to me. It just looked like someone who is with a bunch of friends and did it when there was it was me sitting at table with a couple of other of the girls of the group and everyone else had kind of been moving around. So it looks like our table was kind of empty and I was like, no,  What are you what are you talking about? Like this is this is my table and it ended up being like a sort of miscommunication between the club where we were sat at a table, you know, they gave it to us as our table but it had been reserved and we were supposed to be at a different table or maybe they just said that because they wanted to give the weekend our table. I don't know but it ended up being that that was the weekend. I had no idea at first because his hair was short so we didn't have that like I want to call it a mess, but it wasn't a mess, but it was just it was a mess. It was a matted dreadlock it was  A lot of things going on with that hair and it's blessed that he had it cut. Do you have encounters like that now we're because even if you don't admit it you are celebrities are quite a few people. I mean if you're gonna be photographed outside of a club like Trisha Paytas, then you can consider yourself a celebrity. So do you have these encounters now where you go into a club and you feel almost treated differently because of who you are generally? No, I feel like my my YouTube and my music or whatever has not got me to a point where it's like Oh, I'm a  Traditional celebrity. So yeah every once in a while you go somewhere like maybe it's a movie theater and someone will recognize you or Disneyland and they'll offer you a ride pass and be like, hey, I know who you are. Like I work here. I can hook you up for a second. Once I'm just saying. Oh, yeah, but now it's not too often and when it is generally my audience is, you know teens and stuff like that. So if I was to go to a club I usually wouldn't be special special treatment for me. So going forward.  You know this music is going so well, what else is there that you really want to be able to achieve with that? Like what is you know the short term? Let's say 1 2 3 your goal with your music because you know yourself funding a lot of this so you can't really say why one album out because that's within your control. You can say I want to have a video out because again that's in your control you've done both those things. So what is something that you would like to achieve with your music for music in the short term, I definitely am doing this tour. I'm promoting my album my current album. I want to do features. I wanted I want to do I just want to  Keep on making more stuff and I would like to really get the music that I've already made out. There. There's a lot of people on my YouTube channel that don't even know that I make music for some reason. I don't know how I mention it in every video. But but some people don't they never go click on Spotify and listen to the song They just they stick on YouTube and click the next video. So I'm trying to I just want to get what's that Riff Raff quote. He says,  I just want to blow up and get so famous and act like I don't know nobody. Well, you know Madison like that Madison Beer is independent and her next song which I've heard and it's a banger and a half has offset on it. So, you know these like collaborations that in your head seemed like out of rate your analysis. You just gotta release your inner clown chase. If you see the weekend the complex time be like yo, what's up? I'm scottysire. Here's my music. You never know it one day.  The right Cloud table Yeah, and this is my table get out. Perfect. So one of the great things about the show is that we have Dave's Bob. Some bangers are associated playlist. It is filled with so many bangers. We pick two songs from your latest album. It can be what you're before me on tour. It is American love tell us about that. Well American love was my first time branching out from my friend producers. And so it was my first time spending a lot of money making  song and it's my more Club Banger e type of song Banger e that's not a word is it? No. Yep Club Banger. He's absolutely a word Club Banger e no, but I went I went kind of out of my comfort zone. I didn't wrap about, you know mental health and my social anxieties quite as much as the rest of my songs, but I still kept that same Narrative of you know, I'm drinking in a club because I'm uncomfortable in a social setting I end up meeting someone and I'm super stoked about it.  And as life goes it ends up being that she had a boyfriend and I was a mistake and you know, she never meant to hook up with me. My life every guy beat is not spacely the situation. The next song is Take Me Away. So tell us about that one. Take me away. That is the single the big single the one I released before the album and then as now the bit what do you call it? The lead song on the album single? Here we go. Yeah, that's that represents the whole album that one is  About me meeting Kristen at Coachella and it's about not wanting to be in an uncomfortable situation. But something good can come out of even something that you don't enjoy so I went to Coachella. I don't like being around big crowds of people and I just kind of like force myself to do it. Get out of my comfort zone and something good came out of it. I ended up meeting my girlfriend and you know, we've been together for a long time now and I'll go back even though I don't want to be there because you know, she wants to be there and you know it  Something something good comes from the bed. Well, it's all going to come full circle when you finally perform that on the stage at Coachella. That would be great and be sure to follow Scotty shout out your socials.  My socials are an Eclectic mix of names. I have vanilla dingdong on Instagram. I'm not scottysire on Twitter and Snapchat scottysire on YouTube.

Just just let me know when the interviews up. Yes. Thank you so much for being a part of this Scott. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.
Whenever you're ready.  I am so excited to be interviewing comedian and podcaster himself Francis Ellis. Thanks for having me Zoe. This is fun. So excited and if you notice the sound quality's a little better. It's because I'm recording in a better Studio than my apartment. Anyway, I thought I've just kind of touch on some background information first if you don't mind introducing yourself where you from, where'd you go to school?  What'd you study? Sure, so, my name's Frances, I grew up in Maine. I went to Harvard and studied political science and English while I was there. What was it like Harvard Harvard was fun. I liked it. You know, it's funny. It's like when I say that people always have a joke. I don't have a joke. I'm not feeling like they're like, where'd you go to school? And you say Harvard?  Third and then they want to fuck with you. Can we swear on this podcast? I'm sorry. Okay, they're like, they're either like oh look at you know, like look they just think you're an asshole for saying that and I know it's even there. Yeah, maybe they think of fucking with them or they'll or they'll be like because it's such a cliche only the douchebag in movies ever says that you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, I guess it's like hard to not I mean, there's no other answer than actually saying where you went to school. Well, that's right. That's right. But nobody says that when you say Stanford or Yale Harvard is a douchebag answer. It's like you people people think you're being a dick when you say that well, but what's the alternative just why? I don't know. Yeah, I guess a real one.  You played a sports? They're great. Yeah, that's that's what I end up doing. I just deflect and say well I played lacrosse there which helped me get in that helps your cause I don't know about that exactly. That's another douchebag answer. It's okay. Well, you studied political science and English. Yeah literature him. So but as overall you like your experience at Harvard. I had a great time there. I loved it I learned  How to write there and you know everyone a lot of people say like, well my God, you're a comedian and your parents and you went to Harvard your parents must be disappointed or something, but I would argue that more than a lot of my friends. I'm actually using a lot of the things that I learned in college now in my life. Yeah. Definitely. I mean definitely having that background in English and being well Brad, I'm sure and just being able to speak is  Yeah, speak and write to I mean, you know, it was it was a blogger bar stool for a couple years and and I think everything I learned about writing was stuff that I had learned at in college. Did you do comedy and in college a little bit my senior year I started doing it. I got into stand-up. I did two shows my senior year. There was a comedy club in Cambridge called The Comedy.  Connection or the maybes the comedy Studio it was above a Chinese food restaurant and I would always walk by it. And when I got the urge to perform I finally walked in there one at one day and asked if I could they gave me a spot a couple weeks later. That's awesome. Yeah, and then is did you come to New York directly after school? Yeah. Yeah. So I was a I'd applied for Teach for America and I was kind of excited about that idea and  And I thought I was going to get it and I but I had applied in the like the last round and right as they were checking over our applications. They ran out of funding for that year and they had all these cutbacks so they had kind of offered me a job and then they took it away no way and when that happened that was late to that was April, you know month before graduation and that's when I said, all right. I'm just gonna move to New York and become a comedian see if that I can make that work.  That's awesome. So did you start working directly for bar stool then or oh, no. No, I moved to New York. And I this was in 2011 and I got into the Improv scene at the Upright Citizens Brigade UCB. Oh, yeah. I was doing my boyfriend. Yeah. It's a great place if that's where you know, if you're trying to learn improv. I actually really like the sketch writing classes there too that I took I think I found those more use  For even for me than the The Improv classes, but I worked there. Sorry. I took classes there while I was also doing stand-up and then I started tutoring. I got a job tutoring in that was like what I ended up doing to supplement my income while I was being a comedian and I did that for about five or six years maybe before I finally got hired at Barstool got hired bar stool at the end of 2016 and you mentioned your parents or  like the joke that your friend say about your parents not wanting you to go into comedy. But that is that really how they felt or did they also see that connection between English and comedy? Well, my parents were totally supportive regardless of what I wanted to do. I think they knew that I was going to be realistic about it. They didn't see me as some delusional Wanderer who was shipping off to Los Angeles to find myself as an actor, you know.  I had I had a pretty specific thought and the fact that I was able to, you know, pay my rent while I was pursuing it. That's all they cared about. Yeah, they knew you wanted to initially do Teach for America. So I guess that that makes sense.  So I wanted to kind of I'd obviously know you have places to be and so I kind of wanted to jump right into that. I don't think your life is exciting, but I wanted to jump into kind of the  some questions that touch on like the theme of my podcast course. Yeah, but just for some background when I was brainstorming questions to ask I kind of got stuck because I knew about you being fired from Barstool and know you by your podcast but I didn't kind of had heard about that on other podcast. I just really want to beat a dead horse. Hmm. So I was then looking through our mutual followers and notice it was very male might be  Hopkins lacrosse teams following you and I saw my friend Adrian was one of your followers, so I called him and I said listen, I'm talking to Francis about for my podcast and I stuck on ideas. You know, what could we come up with and he gave me some great insight and he said, you know  Francis is kind of looked at as  he's my idol. He's awesome. I mean and it makes sense. Like you're a good-looking guy. You had a phenomenal education. You were a demon athlete. You're obviously very funny worked at Barstool like your kind of the ultimate bro. So you kind of are and I think people especially young guys like 20 something year olds will consider you or your life to be pretty ideal. So I kind of wanted to ask you about your life when you were working for Barstool.  Prior to being fired but was your life really this picture-perfect? Oh God, no, not at all. And you know, I hate to burst Adrienne's bubble. But you know, I've had unfortunately always been Afflicted with what what is now almost become a self-fulfilling prophecy for comedians, which is you know, the really persistent.  Self-doubt, you know certain real bouts of depression and and self-loathing all that stuff. And you know, I've been a little bit open about it. I was a little bit open about it at Barstool. I kind of had a moment there where I was really struggling for a long period of time with  I thoughts and it all came tumbling out of me in a blog that I wrote one day where I just it was like  it was me just thinking out loud on Page in a blog about suicide and I wrote this long thing which was meant to be a way to show people how I deal with suicidal thoughts. And of course Barstool is a light is meant to be a light-hearted diversion funny humor sports blog for people. And so I I don't I didn't I put  Up, I hit publish for about 10 minutes. And then I had this feeling of like God this is way too personal and too dark. This is not what people come here for so I took it down but what I've learned because this is what also led to me being fired. Is that any blog you put up for even a second is going to be immortalized or you know screenshot and and then of made available the internet is written in ink  so it's still going to be able to be found and so Bunch people found it and it was it was me revealing to a lot of people that you know on a daily basis. I have suicidal thoughts and and that I had a gave like four or five ways that I try to keep them at Bay which include, you know, making sure that I exercise a lot getting outside, you know, taking joy in the success of other people around me because if you pin  Or emotional ups and downs on your own life. You're putting so much pressure on yourself and the outcomes become far more heavy and affect you more. Whereas like to see a person around me at Barstool having a great blog or having a great show or whatever and it's genuinely feel in a get excited by it for them means that you're getting these these boosts and you don't have to work for them that hard. It's just a matter of being  being excited and empathetic but I wrote this blog and you know within that day. I must have received 400 emails maybe 700 DMS from people who were so moved by it, but more importantly who couldn't believe that I was going through this thing that sounded so similar to what they were going through.  And to have to have shown these people from all over the country all different types of people that that they're not alone, you know in their Darkness or they're tough moments made me very grateful that I had actually publish the blog and it was it's to this day the thing that I I'm happiest about having done at Barstool. I had no idea actually  Hunting that article surprisingly but I mean that kind of answers a lot of my questions just out of curiosity board the responses and DMZ received like mostly from men. Well, yeah, I think I think they were probably yeah. Absolutely. You know, my Instagram following at the time was like fifteen percent female 85 percent male and so yeah, I think definitely so I mean I was getting I was getting messages from doctors who were fans.  Who would help you know offer to everyone wanted to say said, you know, if you ever want to talk yada yada some people offering their support some people saying, you know, I got a message from a guy who had said that the day before he read my article he drove his car to the middle of the George Washington Bridge got out and stood over the railing with the intention to jump. He had written his goodbye notes to his girlfriend.  His parents and all this and he stood there for a long time and something made him get back into his car. But he you know went to bed didn't feel great wasn't feeling good at all. Woke up read my blog and said that that he thought my blog was the thing that had spoken directly to him that had sort of pulled him back from the ledge so to speak and I don't I'm not trying to take credit for that. But even if one person  is that affected by something that I've written you have to say that it's worth it thousand percent. I think I mean that's just what I want to do with this podcast. Yes show people that have people on it so they can share stories like that and just take solace in it and be like, oh, okay. I'm not the only person feeling like this. I'm not  You know, the only one suffering I mean I had no idea about that story and I still asked you to be on the spot. Yeah, it's crazy. How did the people from Barstow response that they wanted to put it back up? No, you know, I think I think everyone knew it was something that was deeply personal to me. So people a lot of people for at the company, you know wanted to make sure that I was okay. I don't think that it was the first time I had met  Allusions to having dark thoughts. So I think people had always wondered been a been aware that there was something bubbling under the surface a couple guys pulled me aside into quiet rooms and sat down and talked with me for a while. And and and I think it was just another case of like you just be shocked at how common yeah such an extreme thought is  and the way that people have dealt with it and you know how they get through it. Everyone's different. Right? So you'd have to say though that that anyone who has attempted suicide or really even gone to such lengths to think about it that much, you know, they've survived themselves in a way because nobody wants to be  This way nobody fucking I think that's that's the biggest misconception about depression and mental health mental illness is that people who don't have it assume that that it is a kind of an Indulgence. Yeah and trust me, you know, I am not following. I'm doing everything I fucking can to to make my brain as you know steady.  And normal as possible. I have a sit to from my diet to my exercise routine to my therapist really expensive therapy sessions, you know, all that shit it is part and parcel of keeping this machine running despite. The fact that there is a severe dot design flaw. Yeah in what I who I am, so there's a great special right now on HBO Gary gulman special. It's called the Great Depression.  And he's one of the best comedians in my opinion in the world and roundly known among comedians in New York as being one of the greatest joke writers there is and it's an entire hour about how over the last two years. He had such a severe bout of depression and he's been dealing with his whole life, but that he hospitalized himself and it's all about his recovery from that and he somehow finds a way to  make it this bubbly light-hearted wonderful, you know pontification on depression and he truly frames it as a disease and not some you know, woe is me feel bad for me because that's not yeah. It's like breaking her ankle. I mean it's physical and mental and it's terrible right? So I'm just kind of curious. I mean, I know that you wrote the article as kind of a way to  through which you could  kind of process everything. Did you usually write to process your thoughts? Yeah for what I learned about a year in at bar stool was at the more personal that I got with my writing the more that it connected with readers and that's when I stopped kind of writing like oh look, you know, here's a video clip of a late-night fight at a Denny's and here are my thoughts on it. I stopped writing that stuff and I started writing.  You know 1,000 word imagination pieces about you know, the girl that works at this local cupcake shop and whether or not we're actually in love, you know, or you know, all kinds of just totally ridiculous long form anxiety riddled over-analytical many many.  Paragraph pieces about a very small exchange and the I was so open and so transparent but I would exaggerate a lot. I mean, I would really speak a stream of Consciousness that should never have been on page and then occasionally you kind of forget what should remain personal and maybe quiet to you and you open yourself up a little  Too much and that was always something I struggled with because I never really knew where the line was. Like, you know, should I be burnt should I be talking about members of my family? What should I remain private with it was this gesture written comedy or is this also in stand up? Yeah. I think I'm I'm always at this point. I'm pretty open in every Avenue that I'm involved in so in stand up though you  You have to be funny every 30 seconds. Yes. And so you don't really have the luxury of going on for a full paragraph Without a laugh whereas in a written piece, you know, exactly so I would say I do it a little bit less in stand up, you know, you know, yeah because I mean obviously you touched on it earlier, but  There's a very strong connection between mental health and comedy and you see a lot of different comedians kind of use it almost seems like they're using comedy or stand-up as their form of therapy. I mean like Pete Davidson, for example, like openly talks about his depression and it's  But then he's kind of labeled almost as like this self-deprecating comedian. Like that's you know, maybe what his comedy style would be do you think that the fact that I don't know I guess I'd like to hear your thoughts kind of on.  Whether that's healthier like or hurting or negative that people use Mental Health in comedy so much or rely on it. You know what? I mean? Yeah. It's a great question. I don't think that a stand-up stage and a microphone are an adequate substitute for therapy. Yeah or medication and I fear that a lot of comedians actually believe that  they think that by going to an open mic on a Wednesday in the Lower East Side and getting up there and speaking their Truth for five minutes about how miserable they are that somehow they are being proactive about, you know, their brain chemistry, and that's ridiculous because  you're not you're not getting answers. You're not you know, you're not taking True steps forward to fixing yourself. You're just dumping and one thing that you know mental health issues and depression or it's so pervasive in stand-up comedy that it's almost a joke itself. And sometimes you kind of Wonder, you know is a comedian on stage.  Talking about being depressed just because they've seen all the great comedians do it and they think this is the language we speak or are they truly suffering and and and usually you can kind of hear it in the way that they talk and what they're talking about. But what happens the big difference is right the the great comedians that talk about  Out there depression. That's the Gary gulman guy. They they will still write jokes and really great jokes about what it's like to go through this and Gary gulman. For example. One thing he talks about is how he knew he was in trouble when he started eating ice cream with a fork.  Right, like if you find Fork tine marks in an ice cream container, that means that that person is too depressed to use a spoon and a bowl like a normal functioning person. And I think that's that's great. Right? Yeah, and that's like actually trying to find the silver lining in the light in this dark thing. But if you're just getting up there and kind of wallowing in your Despair and trying to elicit sympathy  The audience I think you're doing a disservice not only to yourself but also to to mental illness because you're just saturating everybody with it. And then everyone stops believing it. Yeah, I think also I mean it  I think in some ways it almost then is either used as a crutch kind of or a card to pull out and also.  I don't know. I mean I do see the importance of bringing it up, but  I  was I going with that I think.  Sometimes like the whole point about mental illness is that it's not doesn't necessarily, you know, it's not blatant and in your face like you could come off like you are as like a very personable person and very happy and all of that and still suffer. So it's it's not doesn't have like a face and it doesn't have an act. It's pervasive regardless of what you're talking about kind of and just like how you said with this comedian who talked about ice cream and kind of Incorporated it.  Except the whole point is like he right. It's so high functioning still happy person or comes off as that, but you know also has these awful thoughts. So I think that's I mean even just the fact of like kind of how you opened up about your article shows that I mean I had no idea. I was just going to ask if you ever made jokes about  Anxiety in the past like little Rhino, you know? Yeah. No, I yeah, it's so you know, your original question was is it bad? Well, let's say like should should comedians be using it as a crutch and I don't think so. I don't think that's good at all. Of course. I think it's like any subject it, you know, it could when presented right can make for amazing humor, but if it's just  Mentioned as some kind of for the sake of mentioning it, you know, that's that's bullshit. Yeah actually read this article recently that was talking about how there's now exists a culture or twenty something year old guys kind of who aren't in comedy but they use comedy maybe in like daily life as their means of therapy. I think that can probably be traced back to what they you know, what they watch on Comedy Central and things like that or what they see from comedians because the  Like oh this is the way I can joke about it and just kind of brushed off rather than actually dealing with their issues. So I was wondering I mean you mentioned that you go to therapy, but for someone who a guy who got her can't afford it or what resources are offered to other comedians or just in general if any to deal with their anxiety or depression Etc, I guess I guess this goes to  almost to the blog that I wrote which is, you know what I can only offer what has helped me and if you can't afford therapy, you know, that's that's sad, but I know that there are help centers and even you know, if you have health insurance, you can get in network therapists who are very very good, but  What I would say if that's not an option is, you know exercise for me is so valuable. Yeah, I really make a point every day to get exercise in some ways, you know, whether if I'm if I'm lifting weights or running on a treadmill or even just getting out and you know jumping rope or something like that. It doesn't need to be on a full-on workout, but  Get your heart rate moving and get your blood moving and it just adds oxygen to the brain. And for me that has been an immensely important tool in helping me sleep. Well, so that's like the first thing sleep is so important, you know, you hear a lot of very depressed people say like I just never want to get out of bed. I just want to stay in bed and the key to getting out of bed in the morning is not going to bed at 1:00 in the morning. Yeah, you know try try.  To have your light off before 11:30 and the key to that is not bringing your fucking phone into your bed. Okay, I set up my phone charger out in the hallway of from my bedroom and I will plug my phone in and I will set my alarm and then I will walk into my bedroom and it's in a different place and I will  I will then I will read my book before bed. Maybe five pages. I don't know. I don't want to sound like a Hermit but your phone screen should not be the last thing that you see before you go to bed. Yeah, you know wipe it from your brain and then your phone alarm will go off in the morning and you'll be forced to get out of bed and you will go turn your alarm off and what you should not do is then pull your phone out of the plug and go back into bed with it. Keep your bed and your  Own separate. I can't tell you how important that is. Yeah, that's true. I should definitely be better about that. I guess kind of the last thing I was wondering about in regarding mental health and kind of how it works. How men do all these I think that there's like a tendency or to unwillingness of for young men to share their feelings. And I think that I mean obviously your whole job is share your feelings, but  Whether they be about mental health about your day what not. So I guess kind of what advice would you give to?  How would you encourage young men may be in their 20s who are think that by showing weakness it for showing?  That they're not happy.  How would you encourage them to open up? Well, I think mental health like a lot of issues has really taken amazing leaps forward in its Acceptance in popular culture. If you were to compare it to you know, America's thinking on like gay rights, you go back to the 50s and and 60s and gay people were seen as an aberration it.  You know it was it was there were there were no gay pride parades. It was this unbelievable couldn't fathom it. It was detrimental to the nuclear family all that shit and then, you know within 30 years and especially within the last 15 the country has swung over to everyone's in favor of gay marriage gay marriage. Yeah, of course, like what are you talking about it you're seen as being a crotchety out of touch idiot if you oppose it.  So that's a good parallel. I think you know, I think with so many celebrities and comedians some athletes have opened up about their struggles with mental health a fascinating one for me is Ron Artest. I watched his he was a NBA player famously played for the well played for the Lakers with Kobe for years, but before that he was playing for the Indiana Pacers.  Hours for the famous malice at the palace which was like, it's like the worst brawl that has ever happened in the NBA where he went into the crowd and started attacking fans and it was only found out later. I think that he had severe bipolar disorder and now he has become a spokesperson for mental health awareness and is you know, a very decorated face in that  Eddie and his but here was this tough kid from the streets, you know who came up as an NBA player and nobody was talking about that but had he been more open about it, you know, you can't help but Wonder might have made the team or the organization have helped him get the help. He needed to avoid this sort of thing that happened.  He probably retired and maybe like two thousand thirteen or fourteen or something. But he's playing all through the 2000s and yeah, but even back then I mean, yeah, you're right just in terms of progress. Yeah recently. That was something like I can't like really creative but it's something comparing kind of how baby boomers talk about mental health versus like Millennials and gen Z, whatever right, but just by Heart Like harsh contrast.  Us be more open which I think is just so imperative. Yeah, but as far as again teach your question because I feel like I keep getting sidetracked the  you know, I'm hoping that a 20 year old man in college in a frat, you know, it may now or maybe a couple years from now, I won't be worried about going to his friends and saying dudes, you know, I need help. I'm not happy. I'm really not happy. I'm really miserable. I'm having a lot of dark thoughts and that not those those guys will  Know where to point him, you know, even if they don't feel comfortable kind of helping him out on their own they'll know enough to say like dude, you have to go to the office of health services or the whatever the place on campus and you need to talk to somebody because there are people here that are set up to help you you got to do it today. Yeah fucking go and hopefully that, you know, that becomes a normal thing like  Telling somebody hey man, like I cut my finger. Where do I go? Or you know that sort of thing. Do you think that I guess?  I mean you worked at Barstool witch.  Is controversial I guess like the company and kind of more so I'd say left the company and more. So just kind of its audience.  Do you think that in any way or did you ever find that you kind of had a felt that it was promoting a culture of like toxic masculinity that would in some ways kind of?  Prohibit that um, it's a good question. I I didn't feel when I was there that that the work that people that that everyone was putting out was encouraging men to revert to yesterday's thinking I did not feel that Dave or anyone there was sort of like  Sizing men to mistreat women or or to dive deeper into the toxic masculinity thing. I really did not feel that way. I think unfortunately what happened was culture. Yeah became so much more sensitive to it and rightly. So rightly. So I think I think the outside world really moved forward and saying like it is no longer okay to  talk to women this way in the workplace. It is no longer. Okay to do this the me to movement exploded while I was at bar stool. So you know with that unfortunately came a lot of you know, a lot of people started pointing to Barstool for stuff that they had said in their 15-year history, which yeah 15 years ago. I mean if they had said some of those things that they'd said 15 years ago today.  A or 10 years ago, you know. Yeah, you'd be like, whoa. What are you doing? Like you got to know that that's going to cause some problems. But while I was there, you know from 2016 to 2019. It had already undergone a major overhaul a major, you know, a major effort to become more gender balanced in terms of its content contributors in hiring a  Erika nardini as a CEO and you know Dave was the first guy to tell me like when I wrote whenever I wrote something that was controversial like yo, you got to be careful. Like don't do that. That's not who we are. Yeah. So, you know, the ultimate irony was that I ended up getting fired and effectively taken down by an article that was portrayed as being somehow anti-women although  People didn't really say that. I don't think anyone really saw that because frankly if it had been a man I would have written the same exact thing. It was just grossly insensitive to to a very, you know, very touchy subject and with a terrible outcome. So, you know, who knows? I don't think anyone would have said that any of my work leading up to that point though is misogynistic and I don't think much of the work that I saw there was particularly so  so hey guys, so I just wanted to quickly say again how I record my podcasts and it is with anchor as you may have noticed the sound quality is got little better because I bought new microphones, but I still use anchor to publish and distribute my podcast to Spotify and apple podcasts and probably a bunch of other platforms that I don't know the name of but shared there and it's really the coolest thing ever because it sets me up with ads that are companies that I can.  Answer and then get money from and it's the easiest thing to do. All you need to do is go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started or you just download the app from the App Store. So again, I definitely definitely definitely recommend it and if you have any questions, you can just send me a DM.  I'm going to ask you now 5 questions to end this episode just so we can kind of guess like dive deep for the last couple of minutes. Sure. So the first question what's one thing in your life that's happened to you. That's made you a stronger person today. I would say definitely getting broken up with by a person that I was deeply in love with a girl that I dated for seven years. Thought we would end up together.  And that ended and it sent me to a pretty dark place and but then you kind of each day you get a little better and you find happiness again and then you realize okay. I got through that that didn't kill me. So that'll make you stronger getting dumped.  I guess and what point in your of your life that was that like that wasn't it? Yeah, that was in I guess 2016 right before bar stool like eight months before Barstool. Yeah. Okay second question is do you believe everything happens for a reason?  No, I like to think that I have some control over my own choices and that not everything is inevitable. But I also know that when bad things happen a good way to to bounce back from them and to find the positives in it is to say like okay, you know that happened for a reason and how can I grow and learn from it and prevent it from happening again? So it's weird. It's like when things are going well, I like to think.  I made that happen. And then when things are going badly, I'm like God is fucking me, you know, yeah, that's that's true. Yeah, we're like just finding this out like the silver lining in everything and yeah and making it something good. I guess you can look at everything as being something good or at least like a learning or a lesson, right? The crystal ball could tell you anything about yourself your life the future or anything else. What would you most want to know?  Um, I'd love to know if I will be performing stand-up in 10 or 15 years, you know, is that something that I'm still going to be really passionate about will I be much more successful in that in 10 or 15 years, or will I be doing something adjacent to stand up, you know, like writing for a TV show or acting or whatever it may be that's something that I'd like to I'd be interested to see.  Do you kind of have an answer that you'd want to know like you'd wanted to be? Well, you'd be blown away. If I looked into a crystal ball and 15 years from now headlining Madison Square Garden, you know, that would be pretty nuts. But even if it were like theaters, that would be cool or I guess sold out clubs all if all my club shows were sold out, but I'm not that far out like I'm sold out clubs now, so I guess  Just want to know that things were a little bit better than they are right now, you know? Yeah got it. Okay. What if anything is too serious to be joked about coming from a comedian? Yeah, I think most comedians will tell you that it there's nothing that's off-limits as long as it's funny. The problem is that certain topics is just way harder to be funny about, you know, it's so much harder to write a fan actually funny.  Rape joke that most people can at least acknowledge is funny and it's even harder still if you're a man trying to do it and I'm not saying like all men should be able to it's not what I'm saying. I'm saying a woman who has more experience with that like whatever is personal to you. It's easier for the audience to connect with stuff. So like, you know, if I shouldn't right I'm not writing jokes about police brutality because I'm not really  Goodbye that whereas like a black person or you know, a person of color who has endured that that's going to be much more personal to them. Yeah, cause you to write things I guess that you have experience with. I think it's easier to for an audience to buy it from you. Yeah, Yeti. It'd be pretty hard to buy that. Yeah.  What do you love most about yourself?  Um, I like that I wasn't what's that love. I love that. I was not afraid to take a shot on on something. That was so uncertain as comedy. You know that I've never shied away from going off the beaten path and not doing the safe thing that in college. I didn't follow the way that all my friends were on of going into Finance or  Having really pretty secure livelihoods and becoming very financially successful that I just struck out on this idea of being a comedian and you New York and you know, I think seven years later. I was headlining the Wilbur Theater shooting my special in front of 1,600 people and that was Major validation for me that I had made a decision. That wasn't insane, you know. Yeah, I think that's a really good thing to be proud of and  just like you love your courage. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay last question in one sentence. How do you find solace in the city?  Cook for yourself.  I like to cook my own meals. I find it very therapeutic and the focus of cooking and then eating even if you're in a shitty tiny shoebox apartment or if you're on a farm out in Vermont, you know, the taste of cooking your own food is makes you feel like you're at home and that's peaceful. Yeah. I never really thought about that. What do you cook I cook very simple food. I'm fine.  Means a chef de cuisine but you know, I like to cook fish and sort of more of like a Mediterranean diet type thing like that. Yeah.  Practice. Thank you so much for agreeing on the interview. I really can't tell you how much I appreciate this and just will really try to this moment the rest of my life. Oh, please my I'm very happy to do it. It's really fun. Thank you.

So I want to talk about things something that's very very personal and so been pretty hard for me to open up about it for years and years now. So say the least but now that it's been some time that's passed and I've healed a bit. I'm ready to speak about it. So I want to talk about emotional abuse domestic abuse how damaging it can be how some people get stuck in it and how it hard.  Can be to open up to others and you know clear your mind. There's so many aspects to it. That is so challenging and you don't really realize you're you're in some kind of horrible toxic relationship until you're in so deep and you fallen for this person. They it could happen to any of us and I'm sure anyone listening. I'm sure we've all  since this in some sort of way, maybe not as extreme. Hopefully not and if you have then talking about it really helps. So basically you guys if you haven't known I was married and my past. Yes, I am a divorcee you would say and I'm proud of it. I'm glad I'm divorced because I got myself out of a very very toxic.  Relationship. Let's see that I officially last him at the end of 2014 and ran for my life basically packed up my bags packed everything up within hours one morning. My mama came and helped me and relocated me without him knowing where I was. I was officially married for one year.  Here, but I was in that relationship for three years prior so good for years of pure abuse emotional abuse physical gaslighting. If you don't know what that is, look it up a lot of damage happens those four years my self-worth myself love.  Just just feeling trapped being scared. So my abuser. I I it's hard to say that I know I think the reason why I'm doing this for you guys is because I read many many times that speaking about it helps you heal those wounds and helps other people as well as hard as it is for  Me to speak about this. So excuse me, if I'm mumbling here and there so yeah, hang in with there with me. My abuser was Charming smart. He amazing businessman when I met him he showed me all those good qualities and I was a little bit of a broken bird when he found me to be honest.  And I think that's how abusers they can sense who they can control because they you know, someone who has a huge amount of self-love and a self-worth usually don't find themselves in these these relationships and at the time I was little bit I was young. I was lost I battled depression over the years prior.  And I was struggling and I was alone in Los Angeles. I moved from Colorado few couple years prior and I just I just was just alone and kind of you know, just lost the lost lost girl. So when my abuser came around he made me feel safe surprisingly. He made me feel like  like I don't know just secured and he spoiled me he would always walk on the inside of the outside part of the street. I felt like oh my God, that's so sweet. You know, he would always get the door for me, you know, he was never good at communicating but he filled some voids that I felt felt comforting in a way. I felt kind of like I felt protected.  And he he went above and beyond and a lot of categories in the beginning and it wasn't until slowly. He started showing his anger issues. I'm not going to lie. There was red flags. Okay, there was red flags and usually there are red flags, but we Overlook them or we give them the benefit of a doubt or we just kind of  Make excuses or we see that they're good and other qualities, so we just see it as like, okay. Well we can we can work on those. So again not having that self-worth and not knowing I deserved a lot better. I kept looking over those red flags and a lot of those red flags was the kind of people he hung out with was a big  A big red flag his lifestyle was a big red flag. His anger was the major ones how he would snap even just driving and traffic things like that, even though they weren't necessarily towards me in the beginning. They were still red flags that I overlooked. So  It wasn't until I started falling in love and I was kind of needed him. I felt like and that's the worst thing you can do in a relationship is being feeling like you need them. Okay, that's one thing I want to teach you is you don't need no one. Okay, you want to only need yourself? No one in this world.  Need you more than you and you need yourself. Okay, you need to fill those voids never let a relationship fill voids that you're lacking in yourself. And that's one thing. I wish I could go back and teach myself that you know, Jessica you are worthy you are loved and if anyone's going to protect you you got to protect yourself. So remember that I'm going to give you a little tips and scenarios as I go along with the story.  Yeah.  They abusers will make you very dependent on them. They'll make you feel figure out your weak points and they'll try to fill those voids to make you feel like you need them in your life. But it wasn't, you know, as time went on the abuse got worse emotionally abused the put-downs the anger outbursts and that you it's almost comes like it's a part of your life.  If part of the relationship and and a good years, you know after time goes by and I don't even know I can't tell you why I stayed I think because they flip everything on you so often and fights that you almost feel like it's your fault every time and it got to a point where I was tiptoeing I felt like I was tiptoeing around him because I didn't want to  make him have outbursts. I didn't want to get in a fight emotionally can be very damaging the emotional abuse kept getting worse and worse and worse. It got to a point where I couldn't even ask him how his day was he would flip out on me think I was spying on him. I felt like I couldn't talk like I couldn't be myself because I felt like if I said something wrong or in the wrong tone of voice he would  Take it wrong and flip out and when I say flip out, it's not just a little bit of anger. Okay, I'm talking throw things break things. He would always break all my stuff. He's thrown a candle burning at my face before and I got hot wax all over my face and got burnt. I'm talking about extreme outbursts. I was scared.  And I would try to speak to my family, but the same time, you know, I didn't I wasn't ashamed I guess I was ashamed and I was embarrassed and I was scared. I if I could go back again a lot of these scenarios as if I could go back and tell myself one thing is you you got to tell people when these things are happening.  Happening before they get worse and worse and worse and I didn't open up about it. I didn't go and get help. I didn't I didn't wasn't completely honest about with my family. Like I would tell him that he would have anger issues, but they never knew the extremes of it and every every fight that happened when I say fight when all the damage was done.  I just remember always sleeping on the couch and I was just so depressed and all these every time these things happen every few days. I felt like it was like a roller coaster when you're feeling like you don't know when this Outburst is going to happen when this fight the next fights going to happen when you're going to get blamed you feel like you are walking on eggshells. That is abuse you guys that's not healthy that is beyond toxic. So,  It fucks with your head to it and it messes with your head and you feel so confused. And that's part of gas lighting is they will switch everything on you. Your your state of mind would be like did I say that wrong? I remember always questioned myself with him. Like, you know how he would flip everything on me. And then I'd question myself. Well, could I have said that better or did I use the wrong tone of voice?  And I raise my voice and like you literally playing all the scenarios in your head question yourself and questioning. Like am I crazy? They make you feel like you're crazy if your partner literally makes you feel like you're crazy and you can't think straight that is gaslighting. Okay, that is emotional abuse. And that really just it that over the  Years and I think is why I felt so stuck and I felt like I couldn't even talk about it to anyone. I couldn't get the support I needed because I was so just lost in my head and just I just wanted to cry all the time. I just wanted to sleep. I just wanted to to not think about it on the good days. There was some good days and I was always so happy if I got through three days and no fighting with him without him having  Outbursts and I would literally even keep a diary like okay, this is the third day without his Outburst. I'm so happy things are getting better. And you know, sometimes he'd he'd tell me, you know, he was going to work on it or get get help and things like that or he come and give me a kiss on the forehead not with us his way of saying sorry, but he never really ever  ER said sorry which again I wish I could go back and help myself. Like what what are you doing? You need you need someone to hold your hand and pull you out of this and reality I needed to pull myself out of it, but I was just so emotionally drained. I couldn't talk about it to anyone. I just I couldn't even could even like get the energy to speak about it. So if you're in this anything like this you guys  I want you to know it gets worse it does because as I go on with the story, you're going to see it just gets worse and worse and worse than the more. You keep to yourself the more you don't get help the more damaging this does to your you the more damaging. It does to to the relationship the worst he gets the more power they get and when I say he I mean this can happen for guys to there is very emotionally physically.  Lee emotionally abusive women out there just as much so I'm not trying to just say only men are women can be just as bad. So I'm reaching out to everyone in the world and I want you to know that you need to see these red flags. And if you see them you need to get the hell out as soon as possible because I didn't I was a broken bird eye and every time the fight  Would happen he would say horrible things to me and I think that's why I emotionally I was so gone. I lost myself every single fight a little more and more. I lost myself. I stopped loving myself the little bit of love I had when I did meet him for myself. It was gone real fast after her after dating him for so long and it wasn't until before he  Opposed those are the little time frame few months before things are good overall because he'd claimed he was going to anger management classes and this and that and I believed him and I went with him, you know a couple times, but I thought he was he said he was he said in things seem to be working out and I think in his mind he knew he was going to propose to me. So he  Feeding me all this stuff pretending being known he's doing better and things will change and blah blah blah. We had our I still felt like I was walking on eggshells and I was you know, those those feelings never went away. But again, his outbursts were very damaging to physically all that, but it wasn't until  We got married once I said, I do all those those problems escalated and all those little I'm doing better. I'm getting help went out the window. He knew he had me once we got engaged once we got he pushed the wedding real fast to I there wasn't much time from engagement to wedding. So with enough  Three months or something. It was pretty fast and I think the reason is because he wanted me he wanted to secure me down to make sure I wasn't going nowhere because he knew I had I had so many doubts so many days of the week and I was hurt and I he wanted to secure me down and that's what abusers will do they will do whatever they can to secure you make sure you ain't going nowhere, you know, a lot of men will get their girls pregnant.  Not a lot of girls will want to get pregnant themselves. Even they will try to get married. They will they will cut you down at Nino shun your family. So you don't have family around you. They will put down your friends. So they you don't have that many friends around you they will ask, you know isolate you and anyway the possible. So this was his way of isolating me even more on top of everything he ever did before so  Not only was I you know hoping for a better future, I assumed marriage, you know, I might make things better so which is the stupidest thing in the world if anything I want to teach you guys marriage makes everything any little problems you have escalates like a million times because when you're married with someone you expect them to be treating you even better than they did before. Okay. You're my  When you're supposed to not do those things, you know, you're my wife. You're not supposed treat me like that. So marriage actually makes all those little problems a million times worse. But anyways, once marriage happened that's when things got a million times worse. That's when even more physically abusive it was you know, I'm talking about abuse. I'm talking about knife to my throat I'm talking about  Bruises all over my arms. I'm talking about my animals getting hurt and my dogs him attacking them because he knew it would hurt me. I'm talking about extreme. Okay, I'm talking about I was terrified of what he was capable of I'm talking about him taking my keys away on my from my every time we would have a fight he'd take my car keys and hide them.  Um because he wanted to make sure I couldn't go nowhere it got to a point where I would have to like pack a backpack and hide it so if things got bad, I would have to take off on feet and just leave for hours and just sit at a park because I would didn't know I was going to happen until he cooled down I'm talking about the abuse you would imagine his every time he would get angry at me are freaked out and have it.  Outbursts he would spit in my face and I can't explain how how like I don't even know the word for it is how sickening it made me feel every time he'd spit in my face. Like I remember I was just in shock and every time he would tell me he would never do that again, and he always did.  And the fact that you marry someone and you want to believe that, you know, if they love you, they'll treat you better if you keep trying and you be the perfect wife, they'll treat you better, you know, and I had all these things in my head thinking if I do better maybe if I don't say things in a different way, or maybe if I think about things I say before I talk to him. He won't have it out Bursar. You just kind of  I just started learning how to avoid try to avoid him having outburst and I you know, I felt like but again, I felt like I couldn't be myself. I couldn't really communicate with him. You know, he would be supposedly working and not come home for 15 hours. You know, sometimes he would just say I'm working late so I'll be home at midnight and there was nothing I could do. I couldn't question it. I couldn't ask.  Where what he's doing for work, I couldn't ask where he's at. Who's he's with I couldn't I couldn't I had to just stop any of that because I knew it would turn into something.  The amount of control he had over me I felt so out of control and with this all these things happening. The Depression was on another level. I actually even started cutting myself it was you know, as like, you know, what teenagers do I started cutting myself because that was the only way to relieve the pain. I would remember sitting in a corner of the room just curled up in a ball crying for hours.  And being so lost couldn't think straight, you know, there's days where I couldn't even I couldn't even remember my own phone number if you ask me because I was so my head was so cloudy.  So, you know, I was scared for my life and I did everything I could if I could tell myself back then before, you know, just dating someone you falling in love with someone just because you love someone doesn't mean you got to make it work just because you love someone love doesn't fix everything you guys you can't fix someone that that that is that damaged as much as you love them you  Scan and love does not make them change. Okay as much as you would hope that you would think right you I mean usually if you love someone you want to do better for them or for the relationship, but that's not the case for everyone and I thought if you love someone you do whatever it takes to make it work and I did I did everything I could in my power to try to make it work try to understand.  Try to understand where he was coming from try to help him. I wanted to help him. I wanted him to be happier and not be have this anger inside. I almost felt like he was two different people. He had this there's side to him. That was the guy I knew but then he had this like Devil side to him, which I didn't know. I didn't know this person and it and it was just it would  Like split disorder, you know and I didn't know which I was going to come out any hour of the day, but don't only reason I got out eventually is when he had a fair on me. Not even that many couple of few months after our marriage after we got married which was on top of being a ready to devastated on.  How he would abuse me physically and mentally every other day to add on top of that to add an affair with a very very very young girl to say the least. It killed me. I already thought I was dead inside because of him but to throw that on top, I already talked about losing yourself talk about losing self love and self.  Everything I was gone. I just I didn't want to survive. I couldn't I couldn't get up. He packed his bags. He and I the girl came up to me and she told me where everything showed me proof and I confronted him and he said yep that happened and I didn't get apology. I didn't get explanation. All I got was him coming home packing his bags and telling me.  Me I he'll give me time to move out and let me tell you at that time is abusers make you very dependent on them. And he was very dependent made me very dependent on him. He would only let me work at the time. I was a little I was a hair stylist. I wanted to be a model, but he wouldn't allow me to model. So money coming in was very very small and he would never give me any money. He would he would cover it.  Things the bills and everything and take care of me in that way, but he would never physically give me money because abusers don't want you to make money. They don't want you make you money so you could leave them. So he was smart in that way because he controlled me in that way. So when when I had to leave him when I got to a point where I needed to leave him I didn't have money to leave. I didn't have nowhere to go. I had three dogs and zero money saved up and he  He told me yep. I cheated on you. You get out, you know, he told me that I had to get out and it got to where I couldn't even find I couldn't even pay for a lawyer and I couldn't I couldn't I didn't know what to do and it wasn't until that time where I officially told my family 70% of what was going on, but I never told them how abusive he was but I did tell them.  About the affair and how I need to get out so it wasn't until one day my mom came flew out to California one morning when I knew he was working as soon as he left the house. She came over and we threw everything and moving van and we got my ass out of there and I found a new place to live and it was expensive and  I spent every little penny I had on moving into this place that to rent and I got the fuck out of there as fast as I could and it was the scariest day of my life and I was terrified ever since then to this day. I still have my doubts on my safety to this day. It's I'm still traumatized to see a little a lot, but I'm here to tell you guys my story.  Because those flashbacks they don't ever leave. It's almost like PTSD and I get triggered very easily. I those flashbacks of him hanging me over the second balcony, you know destroying slicing up my mattress all the time cutting up my clothes breaking things. Just breaking everything. I owned throwing  me on the floor kicking my chihuahua putting a knife to my throat.  Police getting called and multiple times but the police never able name never helped me they would make reports and try to go after him and he would flee all those memories just constant even before I moved out. I hate to say this, but I try to commit suicide and to me think about that now is just sickening. I can't believe I almost did it I'll  Early had a belt around my neck. And I was about to kick the chair underneath me in a closet and that's when my chihuahua came into the room my dog and I am she looked up at me and was like Mama like, what are you doing, you know and I jumped down from that chair and I hugged the shit out of my dog, and I just started bawling and I just started praying to God like God, please help me.  Give me the strength, please. And I was that's when I got the strength. That's when I got a little extra strength when I prayed for that strength and my dog literally saved my life and I still have my dog to this day and I look at her every morning and I'm just blessed she saved my life because she did not walk in at that very moment. I wouldn't be here and I mean to you guys and if I can go back to that time that day.  And I would tell myself Jessica you are going to grow and get better and stronger from this and you are going to find yourself alive. This is a lesson. This is a good lesson and you're going to help people and I'm in a such a good place these days. I am so happy and I've learned self-love over all the years and I've read every single book you can imagine you guys and I have grown and I want you to know that if you're in a deep deep dark dark place whether it's Anna.  Abusive horrible toxic relationship or you just are in a deep dark place and you you ever think about suicide please? No, these days will fade time kids better and you will get stronger and to get that was self-help books when I finally moved out. That's when I started seeing a trauma therapist a trauma therapist deals with trauma traumatic.  Circumstances and I took the least had a lot of things and it helped with so I started finding myself and I started reading self-help books everyday and and I started I learned shooting. I started taking shooting lessons and self-protection classes because I had to lift my straining order I had against him. Finally. I got a lawyer for the  divorce and I got a restraining order but because of that restraining order my life was even more in danger to say the least. I'm not staying no one should get restraining orders, but because of my situation it fired him up like you and believe and I had a lot of death threats to say the least from his friends and to say if I don't lift it then I  I won't survive basically and it wouldn't be coming from him. He would send people I have direct threats from that. So what did I have to do is I had to lift that restraining order because honestly the police were not helping me all the times. I kept screaming for help going into a police station making, you know, please report they couldn't watch my me 24/7 they would Patrol my neighborhood.  They couldn't just sit at my house and watch me babysit. So that's when I decided I need to protect myself. I got security. I got a gun I learned how to use it. I did everything to protect myself and I kept watching my back. I never told anyone where I lived and I kept away from anywhere and the area where we used to live and to this day. I haven't spoken to him.  And to this day I still watch my back and I Sakai, I keep my safety up up to standards and I still learn to this day on how to remember to find myself self-love self-awareness and know you're worth you guys know your worth and there's little red flags. You better address it or you buy run and if that person doesn't change or willing to change and it's there. It's just so deep ingrained in  Them you need to leave never speak to them again because we can't fix everyone we come in the counter to and I knew and I know that now and I know that you can love someone but you can love them from afar just because you love someone doesn't mean you have to be with them if they are toxic. They are messing up your world. If they're making you sad upset drained emotionally cloudy your head is cloudy. You can't think straight you're getting headaches. You can't sleep. You can't eat any of these?  Things are happening. You need to get out. I can't believe how much horrible days I had because of this man and it makes me sick to my stomach that I I was stuck with someone so toxic and if you are in something like this, I need you to get reach for help. You need to get help you need to go. I even started going to after my divorce and I was out of that place and I could  I think straight it wasn't until I did move I my head started getting less cloudy the less fights. You have the better you can think so you need to get away from that person to you can start clearing your head out, but I started going to a woman's help groups for domestic violence and they're usually free and you're you're the main cities and I started going to a few of them on top of my trauma therapy.  and I started getting support from women that knew what was that that had the same problems that were facing the same issues and they start understanding and I could they could understand me and where I was where I was sometimes it's hard to reach out to people like family and friends because they just say well, why don't you get out you need to get out or the you know, they don't understand what's mentally happening inside your head and how draining  And depressed let me know depression is as high and and just lost you are and you're weak so you need to reach out in any way possible because you need that support because without that support from other people you're too weak emotionally to do it yourself, and that was my problem as I didn't get help. I didn't tell my story to anyone and that's why I was stuck in a horrible toxic life-threatening relationship for  Or years and I can't believe how how lost I was and I'm just and to this day. I still need help. I still seek help. I still read books. I'm almost considering going back to therapy because I do get flashbacks here and there and I still have to feel like I watch over my shoulder and it sucks that I have to feel like that but you know what? I think we all need to watch over her.  Her no matter what because these days in this world. It's you just never know. So protect yourself protect your spirit get help, please that's immediate thing. You gotta do is seek help. You need to get away from this toxic person. So you can clear your head and remember and these relationships. It just gets worse. The more abuse that happens in more fights that happen. It just escalates and it just gets worse and worse.  some worse, and honestly if I didn't get out  When I got out I don't I wouldn't be here right now to say the least I would be I would be buried in the desert or dropped at the bottom of the ocean and I'm not even joking. I am dead serious 100% serious. I would not be here. That's how bad every time the fights would get and when I say fights it was him fighting himself. Basically, I would I got to a point where I couldn't raise my voice. I couldn't cry he would get mad at me for crying. I would have to lock myself.  Self in a bathroom or a lock myself in a room and wait hours curled up in a ball crying silently trying not to make a sound and let him calm down, you know fights. He would kick me out and not let me sleep in our bedroom. I would have to sleep on a little couch with no blankets who wouldn't give me blankets. It was the abuse you could imagine.  I'm just I'm just happy I'm I'm I survived and I'm happy I'm here to help all of you and I'm happy to help all of you. And if any of you don't know who to reach out or you don't have family or are you tried to reach out to other people, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Sometimes my dams or email gets a little flooded. So you have if you have to write me like 10 times don't don't hesitate.  I am here and I'm I just want everyone to know that you deserve a partner that makes you happy that brings you he's that makes you less stressed and that's the way to go. And if if it's anything else, please get out. Even if it's something minor even if they they argue here and there just you maybe it's less not too big of fights, but it happens still too much. Please get out. You deserve to be happy and your  spouse your lover should be bettering you should make you feel like a better person not less. So just take that and really really remember that for your future and whatever you're in right now you guys thank you for listening to this long podcast. And I promise I'll do more I because helping others is seriously my what I want to do. I want to help others and I can't imagine anyone going through this because it is  Is the worst worse emotions you can deal with all by yourself. It's scary and a lot of people don't make it out of these relationships. There's a lot of murders because people can't get out or they do get out and then they don't safely get out and their spouse comes after them. And I'm just I want I want everyone to get help seek help go to the police go to somewhere. They that the spouse doesn't know. I always have the bag Pat protect.  Ourselves get classes. Tell everyone tell your neighbors. Tell your family. Tell your friends. Tell everyone possible. So you have Escape Route always have Xscape plans a b and c because sometimes you can't get out of the house in time sometimes, you know have nine one nine one one speed dial on push one button the calls do whatever you possibly can 9-1-1 in some states you can text for help get help immediately. Do not  Let this drag on so so it gets worse you guys, please. Take care.
Today is Thursday, October 3rd 2019 on this day in 1995 48 year-old. OJ Simpson was found not guilty of a double homicide while the matter was settled in the eyes of the law the debate over OJ's culpability continues to rage on in the court of public opinion today.  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original everyday. We flip back the calendar to this date years ago and recount one event from True Crime history due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13 today. I'm covering the October 3rd 1995 acquittal of OJ Simpson on charges of  Bull homicide the world was shocked when OJ was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend. Ron Goldman on June 17th. 1994. OJ Simpson was a former football star and actor on television and the big screen a true American treasure, but the evidence against him was indisputable or so the prosecutors thought however on the morning of October  Tobar 3rd 1995 the LA County jury had a very different opinion.  Court was in session after 11 long months the people of the State of California versus Oren Thal James Simpson was coming to a close at the time. It was the longest jury trial in the history of California and in a few moments. It would finally be over the crowd Buzz with anticipation as judge Lance Ito entered the packed courtroom around 10 a.m.  With news cameras capturing every moment Judge Ito requested the audience refrain from reacting while the verdict was being read. And with that. He asked the defendant to rise and face the jury as the clerk announced his fate.  Going into the trial the prosecution believed it would be an open and shut case just after midnight on the night of June 12 1994. The police had been alerted when a neighbor noticed Nicole's Akita howling by her gate its pristine white fur was stained red with blood ten minutes later. The police arrived on the scene in Los Angeles has upscale Brentwood neighborhood. The whimpering dog was standing  Over the dead bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Nicole's neck had been stabbed and then brutally slashed. Ron had been stabbed over 30 times. It was ferocious sloppy work and the killer had left evidence in the form of a bloody glove and Footprints from a size 12 shoe.  Around 4:30 a.m. Police went to tell Nicole's ex-husband OJ Simpson what had happened? He wasn't home. But police officer Mark Fuhrman did find something else a Ford Bronco its interior covered in blood along with the companion to the glove. They had discovered at the crime scene five days later. OJ was arrested for Nicole and Ron's murders, but only after  Drew a 60-mile car chase in which an estimated 95 million people tuned in to watch as OJ drove his Bronco through the streets of Los Angeles at the trial the prosecution team of Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden provided DNA testing showing that the blood found at the crime scene was a match for OJ's but O'Jays so-called dream team of lawyers led by Johnny Cash.  Cochran Robert Kardashian and Robert Shapiro had another story when they dug into the personal history of Mark Fuhrman the police officer who had discovered the bloody glove at OJ's house. The defense lawyers uncovered a sordid past apparently during a taped interview with an aspiring screenwriter Furman had previously admitted to planting evidence to help secure convictions. Additionally. He liberally used the n-word.  Couple times during the interview during Fuhrman's cross-examination Judge Ito allowed for this tape to be admitted into evidence. Therefore. The defense lawyers were able to paint Furman who also owned a Nazi Medallion as a white supremacist. They also established a theory that Furman had planted the bloody glove at OJ's house, even though they had no evidence to back this Theory up it resonated with the jury. The defense is job.  Job was to establish the seed of Reasonable Doubt in the jurors minds and it had taken root.  Coming up the jury reaches its verdict and now back to the story.  After 133 days of televised Court proceedings nearly 150 Witnesses and 15 million dollars of taxpayers money. The people of the State of California vs. Orenthal James Simpson was drawing to a close although the prosecution had a slew of evidence suggesting that OJ had killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The defense had artfully established a  Full amount of doubt. The question was whether it was enough to persuade the jury around 10 a.m. On October 3rd, 1995 judge Lance Ito as clerk Deidre Robinson read the verdict. We the jury in the above entitled action find the defendant orenthal James Simpson, not guilty of the crime of murder as the verdict was read. OJ allowed himself a thin smile.  I'll he mouthed the words. Thank you to the jury as his lawyer Johnnie Cochran slapped him on the back and pumped his fist.  But the reaction from Nicole and Ron's loved ones was Far different Ron's Father Fred Goldman looked up at the ceiling in pained disbelief. The only sound other than Deidre Robinson reading the verdict was of the gulping sobs of Ron's sister Kim Goldman Ron's mother Patti could only shake her head and Whisper. Oh my God.  The reactions outside the courtroom were just as divided as the verdict was announced over the loudspeakers on buses traveling along Alvarado Avenue many of the Riders broke into cheers, but in the ritzy Orange County neighborhood where Nicole and OJ's children were being cared for by their grandparents someone put up a sign reading OJ. You're not welcome here.  The trial had become so ingrained in the National Consciousness that even President Bill Clinton was compelled to release a statement the jury heard the evidence and rendered its verdict our system of justice requires respect for their decision at this moment. Our thoughts and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible crime. Meanwhile OJ was celebrating his Newfound Freedom. He returned to his bro.  Wood mansion at 11:16 a.m. A little over an hour after his acquittal as he and his Entourage partied late into the night. It seemed like his troubles were over but the justice system wasn't finished with OJ Simpson yet.  Although he had been declared not guilty in a criminal court OJ faced a civil lawsuit for Nicole and Ron's murders unlike the criminal system which deals with legal punishment for breaking the law civil cases deal with disputes between two parties rather than dealing out a jail sentence. If the jury and OJ's civil case ruled against him. He'd be forced to pay financial compensation to the victims families in  OJ underwent a three-month trial for the wrongful deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman unlike in his criminal trial OJ was forced to testify previously. He had denied that he ever wore the same kind of size 12 Bruno Molly shoes whose prints had been discovered at the crime scene. But while he was on the stand the lawyer representing the goldmans produced photos showing OJ wearing them on  On several occasions furthermore judge hero. She Fujisaki took great pains to prevent the same circus like atmosphere that had pervaded judge ito's courtroom. He banned TV cameras put a gag order on all the lawyers and prevented the admission of any arguments without evidence. Ultimately the jury ruled that OJ had wrongfully caused Nicole and Ron's deaths. He was forced to pay.  Thirty three point five million dollars in Damages to their families while it wasn't the same as putting him behind bars the ruling at least put him into some financial difficulty and that difficulty would get OJ into even more legal trouble.  As the years passed OJ's Financial woes forced him to sell off his sports memorabilia, but eventually he decided he wanted everything back in September 2007 OJ and several armed men held up a pair of sports memorabilia dealers in there Las Vegas hotel room after getting caught for stealing items that he had previously sold. OJ was charged with 12 different crimes.  Being armed robbery and kidnapping in December 2008. He was found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in prison.  In July 2017. OJ was released on parole the board that heard his case voted in a unanimous for 2-0 decision to Grant him an early release even one of the defendants in the case went on the stand to speak in OJ's defense, but not everyone was happy to see him become a free man speaking to the Guardian newspaper. Ron Goldman's Father Fred said what's troubling to me is not only  Him, but the whole system gives second chances to Violent felons or for that matter anyone in jail. Ron doesn't get a second chance Fred Goldman's comments showed how OJ Simpson's legal battles were much more than just one man facing criminal accusations regardless of what actually happened on the night of June 12 1994. OJ Simpson's trial for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and  Ron Goldman became a Flashpoint for racial Injustice police misconduct and a referendum on the American justice system as a whole as of 2019 those debates continue to rage on and while they do OJ Simpson lives as a free man.

Class is in session. You're listening to squat University by dr. Aaron horse Shake. Now. Let's start the show according to Trenton is manic depression settled and flipping in the fantasy. And what's up Podcast listeners. Thank you so much for checking out Today Show. This is episode 64 of The Squire University podcast the go with each and every one of these shows is to bring you as much Value Pat content help you move better in the gym and in life decrease your body's aches and pains and help you reach your true athletic potential. Now Today's Show is all about how to warm up properly when you get to the gym. So imagine this you're getting ready to lift some big weight. You've got a big Squad day big clean day, whatever you're doing. You're ready to live some big-ass weights. But the first thing you need to do is warm up, but should you stretch should you foam roll should you do lateral kicks with the band what you do? Unfortunately, it can get really overwhelming when you scour the internet look on Instagram talk to friends and coaches as to the best way. Is to warm up because there's so many options. Literally if you scroll through Instagram, you'll probably see 15 or 20 different channels that have different options and different best practices for warming up and you're like do I use this? Is this right for my body? Well, let's talk about it today. Now the first thing that you should do whenever you walk into the weight room is to Define your training goal for that day. Are you doing squats are you doing deadlifts? Are you doing cleans presses bench, press Define what your training?  Goal is because the movement requirements for that lift is going to dictate a little bit of a change for the way in which you're warming up. You're obviously not going to warm up for bench, press the exact same way. You would for squatting. So first step establish a training goal for today. Obviously, it's quite University. So let's just talk about the idea of going in and doing a heavy squat day now think about it like this if you go to a fancy restaurant, do you order every single item off the menu?  Of course, not you pick an appetizer. You pick an entree you pick a desert you pick something from each specific category the same goes for warming up. We want to create a warm up plan that's going to have pieces of certain categories that make up a warm-up that will positively influence our training goal for the day. Is it going to positively influence my Squat and if I leave it out if I leave out specific parts.  That warm up. It's going to negatively impact my lift. It's all about performance when we're coming up with the specific type of warm up that we want to use. I want you to proof form to your greatest potential the second that you pick up the barbell now as a side effect of a proper warm-up, you'll actually be moving better and you will have less risk for injury, but my specific goal of having a in crafting a specific warm-up is not just a decrease injury risk.  But instead to enhance the potential performance for you, this is an especially important as a coach because when you're talking to Young athletes particularly and you tell them hey do this it's going to decrease your risk of injury. That's not going to click in their heads. They're not going to be like, oh, yeah that's important for me because when they're young they're probably not experiencing a lot of injury yet. So the last thing on their mind is let's have this in my warm up for the long run to decrease my injury risk, of course not as with most athletes.  It's our mindset every time we walk into the gym is to get one step closer to our performance goals, or are we reaching and hitting new PRS and my getting one step closer to that 500-pound 600-pound Squad whatever your goal is. That's what's on your mind. You're not thinking about decreasing your injury risk, but what happens and what you'll find out is that if we warm up properly you'll be taking one step closer to hitting those performance goals and have less risk for injury. So let's break this  Now nor warm up into three distinct Parts. Remember you go to the fancy restaurant. There's a appetizer. There's an entree there's a dessert. So let's talk about what specific parts of our warm-up do we need to hit? What categories are there? Well, I want to break it down into soft tissue mobilization Mobility work instability work now in my opinion. I find that a lot of people would benefit from doing some soft tissue mobilization like foam rolling prior to their work out.  Most people are going to come into the gym in they're going to feel either a little stiff from the truck prior training sessions or they're going to feel just a little bit stiff from sitting all day doing whatever they do throughout life jumping on a foam roller in finding specific individual areas that you can roll out a little bit can often help you feel like you're moving better and improve the performance directly after now obviously a foam roller is going to be your cheaper version. There's a number of more high-tech versions of things today. You've obviously got like the hi  Revolt different Farah gun things like that that are going to help improve soft tissue mobilization, but our combat a little bit of a hefty price tag, but there's nothing wrong with those but the idea is that we're improving soft tissue mobilization by getting some tissues to move well over each other again. The second area is going to be Mobility work. That's where your stretches your joint mobilizations are going to come into play with the idea of helping improve your movement quality. That's a difference between mobility and just  Rate flexibility work. Do I need you to improve your hamstring flexibility, or do I need you to improve your hip joint Mobility so you can squat better obviously Mobility has a movement component. So it's going to be much more applicable to helping us move better in the gym better technique equals better improved efficiency so that we can lift some big-ass way. The last part is going to be stability basically in my priming muscles to turn on and coordinate with the rest of the body so that we can keep our joint safe and moving in the eye.  The old alignments that they want them to so let's go back to our squatting example. If you're going to squat you obviously need mobile ankles. You need mobile hips you need strong glutes. So coordination with your hips and you need a stable Court obviously talking just lower body down. Those are some basic requirements. So let's throw out some ideas. Let's talk about the ankles first. Now, how do you know if you have limited ankle Mobility? Obviously, I've shown this test plenty of times. It's called the 5 inch wall test.  Want you to kneel down by a wall put your foot 5 inches from the base of the wall. If you don't have a ruler put your fist down and extend your thumb that's going to be roughly 5 inches. Is it a golden rule for everyone? No, but if you are far away from that wall, when you try to drive your knee forwards keep your heel down. See if you can touch your knee to the wall. If you're far away from that or you have a big imbalance side to side. That's something you're going to want to clear up before you load Your Body by putting a barbell on your back. So let's say you have limited income.  Ability, well soft tissue mobilization. Obviously, we can foam roller ankles foam rolling has been shown in research in many people to improve joint more range of motion directly after so for you if you have limited ankle Mobility jump on a firm roll roll slowly up and down your calf muscles searching out some stiff, maybe some tender spots sit on it for maybe one to two minutes again. I don't need you foam rolling for five minutes one to two minutes max. Get up retest that 5 inch wall.  Test do you have improved ankle Mobility try a deep squat again check recheck see if that was efficient and effective at improving your ankle Mobility, which is what we're trying to go after right here. So that's obviously the soft tissue mobilization category Mobility wise we can stretch the calf muscles. I'm personally a big fan of the deep goblet squat stretch. Obviously, we'll talk about that when it comes to hip mobility section 2 because it fits under there but basically take a kettlebell take a plate.  Usually grab a 10 kilo plate or a 25-pound kettlebell personally sit down in the bottom of a deep squat because you're holding that weight is going to offset your body and allow you to really sit down and stretch out and not have to worry necessarily about any restrictions holding you back from being in that deep position your then just going to swivel your hips and sort of drive one knee over your tone. When you do that. You're going to feel good stretch in the back of your calf Achilles area. The reason I like this one so much is because it's very specific.  To the motion that you're trying to improve we're trying to improve ankle mobility in a deep squat. So the did goblet squat stretch is great for that. So usually something like that I sit down in the Deep goblet squat. I'm going to swivel one knee over the toe. I'm going to feel that stretch in the Achilles region. I'm going to hold it for 10 seconds. I'm going to swivel back. I'm going to do the other side. Usually personally, I do three to five rounds on each side feeling a good stretch now again, why am I doing 10 seconds?  Prior to training most of the time we're going to want to do low duration or low length in time stretches 10 20 seconds research has shown that if you do a very long duration stretch like a minute or two minute held stretch. It's going to negatively impact the ability of that muscle that you're stretching to produce force and power thereafter for some time. Obviously. Everyone's gonna be a little bit different for the next couple.  Couple minutes half an hour hour directly after everyone's different and how quickly that comes back. But basically if you do a very long duration stretch of your calf muscles your ability to produce power and force out of those muscles directly after is going to be negatively impacted now does that mean everyone wants to stretch for only a couple seconds and do 10 seconds stretches before turning not necessarily again. It's all about what you need as an individual for myself. I have pretty good and come over.  Eddie I do a couple of stretches I'm easily passing that 5 inch wall test. No problem. I have other people though that when they try that five inch wall test, it's horrible there like a full five inches away. Basically their name will not come forward for that person obviously improving their ankle Mobility to an even greater degree with a longer stretch hold is going to outweigh the potential negative impact that decreasing force and production thereafter from a  Long-duration stretch, so I'm wanting that improved Mobility much more than I care about a small decrease in muscle performance thereafter now eventually as that person gets closer to maybe doing a meat or something like that where it's like, hey, it's all about performance right here. Obviously at that time, we can tailor our stretches a little bit differently, but during training the technique improvements because of the person's ability to get into better movement positions is going too far outweigh the negative impacts of  All decrease in muscle performance. So obviously again always think what does a person need as an individual? There's no one size fits all when it comes to warming up. Now while you're doing that stretch for your calf muscles if you feel a pinch or a blocked sensation in the front side of your ankle you obviously need to be doing some banded joint mobilizations that will not clear up by stretches or foam rolling alone. It means that the way in which your joints the bones in your ankle are moving over each other is  Is being impacted they're not gliding and rolling. Well, like they should so a bandage joint mobilization can be great. Now if you want a good visual this head on over to squat University.com. Click on the blog article tab at the top scroll down to the third Block. It's called how to improve ankle mobility and I've got a very easy explanation with some visual videos and pictures of how to improve abandon joint mobilization how to perform one with good quality and that should help decrease that pinch sensation in the front of the vehicle. So we're done with  Ankle, let's move on up. We obviously need some good hip mobility that goblet squat stretch. I just talked about that's a great one. I literally do the goblet squat stretch every single day. Just take that weight sit down in the bottom. Usually I try to start off with a stance that's maybe a little bit wider than the normal squat stance that I usually take just because that's really going to try to push my hips open and expose myself to a greater range of motion, but try to sit down there maybe 20 30 seconds and stand back up another stretch that I  usually throw out at this time will be the world's greatest stretch. It's just a very deep lunge. You're going to have your front leg forward and pushed out to the side and then you can also add in some thoracic spine mobilization by dropping your elbow down to the ground and then reaching up as well. If this is something you want to get a good visual of again Square Universidad complot article tab at the top scroll down to how to improve hip mobility. There's a great visual pictures and video as well. So that is going to be stretches for hip mobility again.  Trying to improve mobility and just like at the ankle we can also do bandage joint mobilizations. This is often something that I will throw out if someone has a pinch or black sensation in the front of their hip sort of that growing pain in a very deep squat, they feel like a pinch sensation or if you have side to side imbalances in Mobility. If you have a limitation in external rotation or internal rotation on your right verse your left doing some bandage boy mobilizations can be a  Eight way to really improve those and get things moving more symmetrical especially in the weight room when we're trying to squat clean snatch. We need our body moving as symmetrical as possible. And if you have these imbalances like 10 degrees of internalization on your left, but 30 on your right while it may seem like that's a small difference whenever you're loading your body in a symmetrical manner like doing a squat over time those small and balances small side aside differences are going to create.  Jews in the way, your body is absorbing force all the way up through your body. It's going to lead to an overload of certain areas. And again, it could lead to a potential for injury. We see this commonly whenever an athlete is missing hip rotation, eventually, they lead to back pain because their spine is absorbing forces differently than if they were moving a little more symmetrically so band enjoy mobilizations are great for visuals of this. I have a lot on one of my blogs that talks about bandage.  Mobilizations for hip impingement that's under the rehab section of my blog once we're talking about that. We've got Mobility out of the way. We're talking about stability now now when we're talking about stability, we need stable knees obviously stable hips and a stable core what are things that can help Prime that I'm a huge fan of a few bridges in side plank clamshells, both of these things put a band around your knees. I love using the hip Circle band slingshot Mark Bell those  Make a great quality band. They've got a couple different styles of band. I think the grippy hip circles one of my favorite the orange one. I believe is the one that I have that I think it's the extra large version. I like that one a lot. And then the hip Circle 2.0. I have a red band. That is an extra large that I think is a good quality band as far as the resistance. Now what you're going to do land your back band around your knees. You're going to pick your hips up. You're going to drive your feet really really hard.  It into the ground and squeeze your bum muscles as hard as you can. Usually I'm going to do this. I'm going to hold for 10 seconds. Now, if you're doing this correctly you're glued should be on fire. One of the common things. A lot of people say is when they try to do Bridges like this their hamstrings cramp now a very very easy q that can help decrease that is to jam your toes down into the floor and try to push your feet away now still keep your your heel down so you're not going totally on your toes, but  Jim your toes, don't try to push the floor away from you. Like you're kicking your legs straight or extending your knees. What that's going to do is turn on your quads slightly, which is then going to turn off your hamstrings is called reciprocal inhibition. Your quads do the very opposite motion of your hamstrings. The quads extend the knee the hamstrings bend the knee. So if I can turn on the quad slightly reciprocally your body does this neurological change words like hey quads turning  on hamstrings turn off so we don't get a cramping sensation. So basically if the hamstrings are turned off slightly and you're still performing the same movement of a bridge what else is there to extend your hip your glutes? So that's how a tiny Q where you can get that cramping sensation in your hamstrings when doing a Bridge Drive your toes in the ground trying to push the floor away turn your quads on slightly. It'll really get your glutes firing. I do maybe five reps of that of 10 seconds. My glutes are burning. I'm ready to go to the next thing if you think about it, why is hip extension so important?  The bridge so important to include in their every motion of a deadlift of a squad of a clean of a snatch you have hip extension your hips in a flex position were driving up. So the bridge should be a Mainstay in almost every warm up. If you are doing any of those barbell movements because it's going to Prime that motion of getting your glutes to be the most powerful hip extensors. We run into problems in performance and an eventual injury when we allow our body to  To not rely on those glutes but instead move about our back or our hamstrings more than our glutes. So we really want to prime those glutes prior to training so that they are the strongest muscles perform in that hip extension. I also like to do a side plank clamshell now, this is great for core stability, but also really opens the hips and primes external rotation torque. Now, what is external rotation torque think about it like this. If you go to squat and perform your squat stance Jam your big toes,  The ground drive your knees out to the side slightly still keep your foot firmly planted the ground. Don't let your foot roll inside. But if your foot stays planted and you drive your knees slightly out to the side. What's happening is your externally rotating just slightly at your hip joint in the femur is centering itself in the socket and because those lateral hip muscles are what are performing that action it is creating external rotation torque. So it's a turning force a turning torque.  To drive your knees out to the side what that does is like I said, it's enters the hip joint and we want to keep that external rotation torque engaged the entire squat so that we don't run into an instance where the femur is for basically moving forward in the joint and creating a hip impingement. So creating external rotation torque allows us to maintain those open hips and sit well within our means into a deep squat without the risk of hip impingement. So the side plank  I'm show sort of allows you to Prime that motion you're going to lay on your side knees bent band around your knees. You're going to push yourself up on your elbow knees into the ground. So it's a modified side plank. You're going to keep your feet in contact with each other and just open your knees up hold for 5 seconds. So not only are we performing a movement but we're also performing a static hold. So we're engaging those muscles and then we're going to close now. Not only are you working that upside hip because you're creating movement of external.  Ation, but that down side hip especially in the muscle called the glute medius your lateral hip muscle. Your glute medius is working hard to limit excessive or unwanted motion of the hip dropping back towards the ground. So you're priming stability of your bottom hip by performing the side plank clamshell. It's actually the main reason for for performing the side plank clamshell versus just a regular clamshell. Now, if you scroll back through my Instagram by the time this podcast comes out, there should be a good visual of that.  Motion if you want to see that now once we've gone past the hips we climbed our glutes we've talked about our hip mobility. Let's get to the stable core. My favorite warm up for priming core stability is the combination of the McGill big three now. I've had a podcast dedicated just to the mid go big three. I've talked to dr. Stuart McGill on this podcast three different times. So if you want to go back and listen to any one of those there's amazing information out there, but simply put the McGill  B3 is a combination of Three core exercises the modified curl up the side plank in the bird dog the goal with each and every one of them as a combination is to Kit all parts of our spine the front back and side to side to allow us to strengthen and to turn on every guy wire of our spinal system to keep the spine safe and strong whenever we're then going to  Move big white now your spine is inherently very mobile and allows us to bend over touch our toes to round if we want to extend our spine and do a back bend it can Arch it can twist either way. It can do all combinations that if you're doing any type of the newest latest dance craze, but whenever we're trying to pick up wait, we want it to become instantaneously stable and stiff so that we minimize risk to the spine because the more load that is placed on it when it moves there's increased risk for  Overload of certain tissues and eventual injury but also and more so talking about performance. It allows us to really perform to the greatest potential because they stiffened spine improves our ability to create force and Power in our extremities. So if we can Primark or prior to training it's going to really help our performance and I promise you this the bill McGill big three should be a Mainstay in your warm up. This is something that I really started doing probably about a year ago. And I mean it only takes a few  It's I do the modified curl up. So one leg is bent. I'm laying on my back I brace my corn. I'm picking my head just slightly off the ground to where I could slide a hand underneath my head. That's it. Hold it for 10 seconds. And I do 6 reps of that and then I do the modified side plank now if I'm already doing the side plank clamshell, I leave that one out and then I do the bird dog again six Reps for 10 second holding. I really am trying to squeeze and create tension in my entire body. If you are doing the McGill big three, correct.  Ecklie with enough intensity trying to brace your core and create tension in your entire body. You'll be sweating a little bit by the time you're done. But usually I'll do six Reps for 10 seconds. Now other people will change that up just a little bit Elite powerlifter Blaine Sumner. He's been on the show before he does one set of 20 seconds for each of them. But he's still doing the McGill big three before he ever gets on the barbell and someone that squats a thousand pounds on the regular if that's a  His warmup I think it should be a part of your warm up. And what I noticed personally is that when I took a little bit of time to Prime my core prior to getting on the barbell. Obviously, I'm not squatting at thousand pounds. I'm not even close to that. I'm a very moderate modest athlete if anything but I could notice instantly a little bit more power and strength with my higher intensity reps. Whenever I started really focusing on taking a couple minutes prior to getting under the barbell and priming my core. So that's going to be sort of the lower body way of thinking about warm up now if that  That's all you need done get it in and get to the barbell training a proper warm-up should not take you more than 15 20 minutes 25 minutes max. If you've got all day in to do a three-hour warm-up shirt, you can spend your time and do a little bit longer warm-up for most people we are in and out of the way room. We've got lives to live. We've got very busy schedules, but I need you to take at least 15 minutes to prime your body. Is it going to be a little bit more a little bit less that's going to be individual to what you need in your  Nation or your timing of your schedule, but take some time to do that. Now the question then comes. Well, what about upper body? Let's say you're doing snatches or cleans for me personally. I'm going to be doing a lot of those things that we just discussed. Like I said I get in I do a little foam roll. I'm going to do a deep goblet squat stretch stretch my ankles stretch my hips for me personally at this time. I don't need to ban enjoy mobilizations because they don't have any black Sensations in my ankles were hips. I have had them to in the past. So it's a tool in the  Box to take out when I need to I'm going to do a couple Bridges a couple side plank clam shells and do my McGill big three all in all 15 minutes max. And then I'm ready to get on the barbell. But if I'm doing snatches are clean and jerks that day, which is for me three times a week, even though I'm not competing in Olympic weightlifting anymore as I did for over a decade in the early 2000s. I still train Olympic weightlifting every single week because it's something that I just love to do. What am I doing then? Well again, it's got to be individual to your body.  Again, let's think about the different categories soft tissue mobilization Mobility stability soft tissue mobilization for me personally. My lats can be really really stiff sometimes so I may take a couple seconds and foam roll my lats specifically. I'm going to put that foam roller right at that big chunk of meat that's going to hang out on the lateral part of your armpit. That's where your lats run remember those big v-shaped muscles. They start at your low back and they run all the way up and attach to your humerus bone on the outside part of your arm. So you're going to find  the part where the big meaty part that you can really roll is going to be your lateral armpit for most people it can be pretty painful. If you have a good amount of that stiffness, but if that's right for you, you'll see some improved Mobility directly after I often will do maybe a stretcher to for the lat. I love the Box lat stretch and specifically I really like doing eccentric pull-ups recently. Now a lot of times when people think about Mobility work, we instantly think stretching and foam rolling and we don't often think about  Eccentric components what's an eccentric? It's a forced contraction with muscle lengthening. So if we're thinking about the bench press right, when you contract a concentric contraction would be pushing the barbell away from you. Your pec muscle is shortening as its Contracting. Well The Eccentric contraction is muscle lengthening under tension. So the lowering portion of a bench press your pec muscle is lengthening under tension. Well, let's take that and apply it to your lats whenever you're doing a curl up or  A pull up the pulled towards the bar is a concentrate contraction. So your muscle fibers of your lats are shortening under tension. If you slowly lower under tension, that is an eccentric lengthening and eccentric contraction. Those muscle fibers are lengthening under tension research has shown that in some people slowy Centric lengthening of those fibers can improve tissue flexibility directly after so for me I've done  Maybe two sets of three eccentric curl-ups. Usually I have my hands in the pronated position. So Palm toward my head and I'll do where I'll jump up to the top and slowly lower for about five seconds and get all the way down to the bottom and I'll do a set of three or maybe two sets of have some time and often. I'll notice. Wow that's a huge increase in range of motion directly after when I go to pick up that barbell if I'm putting it in that front right position for doing front squats or doing cleans or when I push that barbell over my head for doing snatches.  Or jerks that bars able to move that much easier into that position. Now again, it's got to be individual true body. So if you don't have stiff Lots you don't need to be doing that. You're just wasting your time always find what you need to do to be specific to hitting your individual restrictions. So you can do PEC slats thoracic spine. That's a lot of Mobility work. Obviously. We need to hit that last category stability work, especially with the shoulders. I want to prime those lateral.  Hers. I love doing the Thera-Band W. You can just grab any resistance band at a gym elbows by the side rotate your hands out. Keep your elbows bent at 90 degrees. Hold it for 5 to 10 seconds again to hold is the difference between doing strength work and doing stability work strength is just your ability to produce force and power stability is your ability to limit excessive run want to motion. So when I pull my hands out to the side and I hold it for a couple seconds those muscles start burning pretty  Goods because I'm turning them on and getting them to contract and turn off for a sufficient amount of time. That's the type of quality in those muscles. I need to work specifically my rotator cuff muscles whenever I'm doing very Dynamic and quick action motions so that I'm allowing my body to stay in those good positions and not faltered under the weight of the barbell. So again, I'm hitting Mobility soft tissue work and stability now, once you are done with those that's when it's time to finally pick up the barbell and start your first  Couple reps now again, we're not adding weight the first set you are doing purposeful bar work specific to squatting. Usually what I do is I'm going to stand up. I'm going to keep that hip circle from the bridges or the side plank clamshells. I was doing I'm going to put that around my knees. I'm going to stand up and I'm going to do one set of maybe eight to ten reps super super slow with that hip circle around my knees. I'm driving my knees outside working on foot stability grabbing the ground knees.  Driven out against that band resistance and if I'm going super slow, sometimes I'll have a couple pauses on the way down and I'm talking my first one or two reps may take 10 seconds to do that. So slow I'm going but I'm feeling for those muscles of my glutes firing symmetrically in my body staying perfectly balanced. Then I'm going to bang out just a couple quick fast paced ones work on my stretch reflex at the bottom and then I will put weight on for my second set now usually talking about that hip Circle band, I love  Swing by first two sets with weight with that band still on my knee. So for me personally if I am doing any type of squatting usually my first set is at 70 kilos. So the big red plates on the side and then usually I'll jump straight to a hundred kilos and with something like that. Usually I will do sets of eight sets of five. Usually sometimes I'll mix it up, but usually my first couple sets are a little bit higher volume. I'm still keeping that hip circle on because I really want to work on engaging my  Lateral hip muscles my poster hip muscles and just having thing everything moves symmetrically those first couple sets are very important to really slow down and make sure that your body is working well and Prime to move symmetrically because a lot of times people will go through them lackadaisically because they're like houses 40 50 60 % of my one rep max. This is easy. I'm just going to go through it fast because I'm still thinking about my bigger sets if you do so and just bang them out really quickly and you don't really think about how you're  He's moving in supporting that load it leads to not having your body primed effectively enough for whenever you get to your heavier sets. I promise you if you take the time to make your one or two first sets with white do them a little bit slower been really really concentrate on getting those glutes engaged having your feet grab the ground making sure that you're perfectly balanced and driving hard off your feet on the ascent. It's really going to pay off whenever you put bigger weight on the bar. So once you go  On through your soft tissue work your Mobility work and your stability work. There's a set with the open barbell at least if you're doing squats or deadlifts, if you're doing obviously snatches are clean and jerks. You're only doing a little bit more of a very specific warm up to whatever you're doing that day and we can go into in the future a little bit more Olympic weightlifting specific warm-ups. I'll have Chad Vaughn on the show and we'll talk about that because Chad's awesome when it comes to All Things Olympic weightlifting, but the idea that I really want to ingrained in you guys is that you're doing  At work and then you're following it up with one to two sets of bar work and then lightweight and just perfecting every single movement. It's something that I've actually talked about all the time, but the athletes that make it to the top become Elite or just think about yourself reaching your true potential and being a strong as you can become to do that in to stay there in to continuously produce at a very high level. It's not because of some secret program that you don't have.  Have or it's not because of some certain supplements that you're not taking but it's um an unyielding desire to perform perfect repetitions. No matter how much weight is on the bar every single touch time you touch the barbell you want to perform a perfect lift. And if you can do that, especially with your warm ups and your first couple reps, it's going to bleed into your bigger list. If you perform a great-looking lift with high intensity at lightweight eventually those heavier weights start moving faster start moving easier because you've primed your body now,  A logically to move the same exact way the big thing to understand is that a proper warm-up doesn't mean selecting everything from the warm-up menu, especially if you don't have time, that's the biggest thing people always tell me. Hey, and I've only got an hour to work out. What do I do? You have to be specific, but if you can find maybe one exercise or to exercise that's right for your body in each of those categories that we talked about today.  It's going to prime your body efficiently that much better to move that much with that much more quality in you're going to have that much better performance. Again, if you are doing the right warm up, you're going to perform better in as a side effect. You're going to have a decreased risk of injury. That's what the warm-up is all about. So, it doesn't matter if we're talking deadlifts if we're talking squats if we're talking cleans if we're talking snatches the same concept applies.  Write down on your menu. What is your goal? What are the different categories and then what fits into each one of those categories to hit what you specifically need people often say, well, what can I do? I don't know what you can do because I need to know what you need individually not everyone needs to do ten minutes of Mobility work. I see some athletes that are very hyper mobile meaning that they have a ton of mobility in certain joints. They obviously just need more of a dynamic  You need to spend a little bit more time on stability work. So we need to understand what your body needs. So that is if for today's show thank you so much for checking it out. It really means so much to me to have you guys listening to this podcast if you're enjoying the shows or you want to hear anything specific in the future any specific topics, or you have anyone that you'd like me to interview for the show hit me up at Twitter at squat University and continue to share the shows across Instagram.

For signee is a brock Belcher out of Birmingham Alabama. Next we have landed renter out of Frisco, Texas. What's up?  Everybody Welcome to the 1/12 podcast. I'm Brock. I'm here with Landon Ritter and Andre is very this is our first-ever podcast. What's up guys? What's up? Good evening, just to start off our first episode. You guys want to start off with a little Icebreaker something like that. Yeah, of course. All right. So what what's your biggest fear when it covers my biggest fear would probably be being alone in my own thoughts for too long. So nighttime very well. I'm very afraid of the night time.  Of the night just just lack of light or denied in general both. It's a thing I can that be a thing Afraid of the Dark. Yeah, uh, he actually does sleep with a nightlight. That's not a lot and your room. That's a this come. No, we have one freshman year in me and NightLight. Yeah, you had one like in your class? No, I swear you had a nightlight Brock. Have you been seeing the light it would make sense?  Yeah, but  Just close your eyes and panic for 10 hours a night my dreams and sleep. Do you even sleep? He's The Machinist. You just doesn't sleep ever its power down just power. It's very hard for me to fall asleep sometimes because I'm too busy being afraid of my own thoughts. Do you have another beer like look like, you know, like like I play high places not your own breaking who know I don't have a fear of falling that's right a fear of heights. Like if you're falling just in general like guys  Lucky, I don't really afraid of tripping. I am horrified of rock climbing. I don't see why people take enjoyment out of that because I'm afraid of falling even though I'm in a harness. You don't like roller so higher I know that I don't like I don't like I don't like being in control. I like being in control of my death. I like well he can control it. That's dark.  Let it all go afterwards. I just throw up everywhere. That's the best part part. No i d like a mama. Well, I don't really like it that much.  I am I I don't like when my stomach when it died drops when they go so super high then it drops into this is a little twisty boy you like trampolines.  No, because my trampolining by myself or my trampoline with my friend, well if your trip way, okay, if you're trampolining by you sit by yourself looking car you have a cyst trampolining a word jumping on a trampoline if your trampled meeting by yourself. Are you in your own thoughts? Yes. Yeah, so that's what I don't like.  That's okay, I guess so it's not that it's not tripling its being alone. Yeah, you're it seems sleep the dark and being alone and roller coasters. Yeah, probably I just I don't know rock climbing. I hate Rock. That's scary climb. I don't like people that what that lady talking about rock. He doesn't like people that rocks with rock climbers. Hey Rox.  So wait do Hitler the mall or like actually going outside and truly fly. I in the world. Would you ever want to climb a rock those people that free time? That's unbelievable. Yeah, that's crazy. I've seen yeah, I see a couple of shows on dudes that like just free-climb giant Cliffs with nothing just one slip and you're toast gone.  It's crazy. What's your biggest fear product? Help my team? I'm kinda they can guess my what do you think it is, you know better than me. You seriously don't do spiders a hundred percent percent. Is that why cinnamons in the bathrooms for deflect all this? Yeah, and then we posted above your toilet to protect me okay to clarify to clarify because we can't visually show you the cinnamon is our baby doll that I gifted Brock from Goodwill. She only cost me $3, but she's beautiful and she hangs up.  Little railing a bathroom. Oh careful toys. Okay. She rests. There you go. There you go. There are things like their toilet and then we have like a little mini picture of what was the flats. It's like a flat stability of the only version of me on dries. It's Watching Over Us taped above the toilet. Just Bobby urinate to make sure that you're doing a good job to protect you doing all your bits from all the spider and we'll also also it keeps me like company. There you go. So you know that  You have to people about yes, just having casual conversations with cinnamon and undress. Yes.  What's your biggest fear speaking in public? Probably doing a podcast that's doing a podcast. Yeah, it was scary. I'm glad you it's really good speaking into a microphone is your biggest finger. Yeah something along the lines. I've always found that funny people that like can't speak about. Yeah. It can't do by just freeze up a little better at it. But when I was in class I talk really fast whenever I give my speech like it's easier to say  Front of a mirror bowing to get in front in front of a bunch of people, you know gets really scary but does it's just like what are these people thinking when they can hear every single Center saying are you acara for what you say is your fear of just being judged by other people public speaking? Oh that's deep. Uh, I don't know. I guess it's I think it's public speaking because it's whenever I'm in a huge group and I'm like presenting on something that is of importance to a lot of people.  It's just like all the sudden it gets really important. I get all 10 nervous and tense. I just talk really fast, but I think I still think I'm pretty good at public speaking. I don't have like a big fear because you just perfect. Thanks. Yeah, is there exactly I know you don't have to doubt it.  All right. So when was the last time you guys went rock climbing last time? I went rock climbing probably. Oh, I remember freshman year when we went to the went to the white water rafting. There's a rock climbing place there. It's closed, huh? What? Well, no, I don't know are we I don't think there's a rock other was there was a little rock climbing. I didn't get to go. Did y'all get together? Yeah. I did. I was the first group that when I was like in the third group in the power went out leading cause of all the scene.  And Johnny, that's cause you're perfect. That's I was with the scrubs man, brother. But yeah, no, we went rock climbing and no, I mean I'm not good at it. I wasn't at the time Johnny was unbelievable. You just flew up the wall. It's cause he's a freak athlete. Yeah, that's kind of crazy. Yeah, that's a lot of time still scary because it was free. There's nothing holding you up. If you got to the top Brock when was the last time you went rock climbing?  The last time I went wrong, I don't know if it was rock climbing, but you know those like ropes courses.  Where you're like hooked in like oh, but there's like ropes that go across from like telephone poles. Oh, yeah. I hooked in by likes candy. I think I know what you're talking about spelunking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and you just zip like, no not exactly. It's like an actual ropes course that you have to like climb your way through and there's like different rope obstacles this flunky. No. No, you just want to say  Have you ever been smelling? What do you do when you go spelunking? I heard you just get all muddy and just kind of crawl between the crevices. I went spelunking in fifth grade. It was in the fifth exactly that yeah, it's great. Well, it was a field trip. We went to the caves in Georgia. We just get a hard hat and then you go to like down in a bunch of caves. Okay, where in the world are their caves and Georgia Tech Georgia? Probably a dumb downtown. There's something South South Georgia South Side South Side. So yeah.  Yeah, you are south of Atlanta. There's no telling what you're going to find on there. But yeah, you just go down and then you just kind of walk through these caves and there's stalactites and stalagmites all over the place. And what's the difference which ones which one's going up the else going down on it? I don't know I could never do what you like. There's an old Jimmy Neutron episode that used to say which one was which I was freaked out. Yeah. I'm not really sure which one is which but and then they take you to this big area and the because there's lights in it, they shut all the lights off and that's like the darkest I've ever seen anything ever.  You turn all the lights off and you're like a couple feet 100 feet underground. So there's a zero light anywhere. You can't see anything. What's so what's the point is point zero seven steer torture. It seems like land is worth sounds like Darkness rocks and being alone being alone and claustrophobia cost him an obeah. Yeah, so they wanted to show you like pure Darkness has complete absence of light. We're going spelunking. That's what we're doing late and me and 112 groups belong and then they just had us climb through these really narrow.  Crevasses it seems really dangerous for a fifth grade and there are couple people. I got stuck in a bunch of places. So yeah, you know another fear being buried alive. Oh, that's imagine. That's bad. That's good. That's just like a natural. Oh good question. Would you rather be burned alive or buried alive buried alive those burning Underground?  That's tough. I'd really varied or drown.  You buried like what how do you die when you're buried alive? You've been at oxygen? Okay. It's like you're honest being buried alive underneath the bottom of the ocean Robert died before you got some fun in the dark is crevice of the ocean. Well, I think I feel like just being in the Box buried alive would be the worst part before you die. And you're just a sec. Okay? Yeah.  Punches know you get like a full-on middle coffin. You ain't gonna be seen the picture of the John Wick three words buried with the cell phone right in front of his face. No. No, that's not from John Wick. That's where it's from another movie. I've seen it. It's the girl that was in Blade Runner the new or one with Ryan Gosling the on a day are my holographic girl. Yeah. Yeah. She is in that movie it basically his family is like out on vacation. He's home alone and heard another friend like  come over and basically seduce him and then they like videotape everything and like their whole Spiel is like they're exposing men and like they expose him and threatened him and like tries to all his money and then they end up murdering him. So they like bury him in the backyard cheese host all the videos to Facebook and everything. So they basically like ruin his life. That's the okay spoilers. All right. What is it out? Yeah. It's a lot of you seen it. Yeah.  It wasn't very good. You know where he's being the terrible actor that he is. Was it a bunch of really good movie? Well, he's a horrible actor. There's no definite Matrix on that. I said, he's in a really good movies and John Wick, those are kind of average. I'll tell I love Donna. I like I watch them the Matrix is very good. Maybe she sells yeah, but he just I don't know how he kind of got his way into acting. He's not a good actor whatsoever. I took Landon who are you to be qualified as a that? I took planted tank Brandon. I think we'd better.  In Atlanta performance in my horror film than Keanu Reeves has had in his Landon or Jack Nicholson from The Shining better actor - thank you guys. It's very nice where would land and Wrangle the all-time actors list? I'm known for my methode active my methodical acting. Can you give me your best Heath Ledger Joker?  Sorry, because you can't spell slaughter without laughter.  I love that and that on the side of his truck. Yeah, what do you drive? Oh my God stupid Christian Bale in that movie good character voice Ben Affleck so much better. I'd have to agree with that. What do you think about that Landing?  I prefer the David what was it? But David Spade David Spade David Beckham first original Joker or at a West Adam West. Yes.  I've got me a bit of a batarang. This is curling bad things around. I'll get another sexy tattoo. Yeah.  The implied Twisted Joker's Posh Spice only cool. I would like to see that just get married.  Oh my God. Yeah, that's who thinks maybe the new Batman.  I hope they have a Whatsit Michael Keaton as Batman Beyond, I think that'd be really it was like old battles like an old Batman been down that road. He's been babbling bring it back making Batman Beyond with a small black suit like the blacked-out suit. That's well. Then you need to get somebody to be Batman. So who would you have to get to be Batman? What do you mean? Well, you know Batman Beyond is not an old Batman. He just teaches. Oh right his name. Is it Timothy?  Valens name I don't know. Who would you have as a new Batman?  I would say Tom Hardy. I'm sorry Ben pain Tom. How are you? I promise you I could put Tom Hardy and at any superhero or villain position. I heard that he might know who I would use Batman Keanu Reeves solution to see his face.  Coming up. Yeah, he's good. He's good.  Better than the new Aladdin already tell you that I can already told I think it'll be okay. It's just how do you beat the old Bank under probably have a little like look good. Obviously. Everybody knows the plot already. All right. All right Max you guys a question we can have this prediction. All right Will Smith's performance in YouTube Rewind or You Will Smith's performance in Aladdin?  I don't use makeup in Aladdin.  Is really bad, wherever Disney whoever designed that character and washed out that much money should be fired yesterday immediately. They release the trailer they should just straight-up animated the person.  I or I don't know who would you actually they could actually pay for that a holographic robbed again brother. Robin Williams would make a great Genie. He would Hi, man. If only that had been done before they should do that. I don't know why they haven't done that who would make a good Genie though? That's alive. Oh John Goodman. Wait, who's you know what Robin Williams actually be pretty good because you need so much heavier set. You would want to make a really cool Jeannie.  Scotty Reeves care, how do you see Aladdin trash kind of trash? Yeah. If John Goodman was chuny I would actually kind of cool would be that'd be weird if it was like a lot e-tail though directed by Michael Bay Paul any Disney movie directed by Michael Bay just any movie directed by Michael Bay. I would love to see the guy that voice is Optimus Prime just be the voice of the animated. Genie. We're like Hello Kitty or something just like some super random, but just has Optimus Prime.  man's voice  I could you imagine like SpongeBob with Optimus Prime's voice. That's what every character is SpongeBob. Just as a Transformers voice. Yeah, that'd be sweet. Be cool next content for the Wonder Woman. We're replacing everyone's voices with Optimus Prime. I will do an entire podcast in transformer voices to be sweet. She did we got to work on that and that's actually work on our transform lives about the Transformers movies. When and where did they start to go down?  Like a downhill kind of square first movie ever. The first move is really good. If you go back and watch it, it's not that good. It's English. I'll about anything. That's cool. It's not really a good movie name one good actually because they're a movie that you like. That's not Korean.  I like LOL and I like I like a lot of movies that are not green. I like almost every single 824 movie.  None of those are Korean. I don't even know what that is. It's a production company. But yeah, where did it go downhill? Yeah, that's the first two were good. I even like the thermal bit. I like the first two when I was in Middle School. I say Mark wall when they Embark Walmart. So the third one was good to that's horrendous. Yeah, I like the when Mark Wahlberg sword fights or was Optimus Prime by himself, and that's when they lost me.  Sorry Mark, it's our emac emac, but when they got rid of Megan Fox though, but then they gave us I like Rosie Hunted Two Girls. They replace her with do you like them? But your name, right? Yeah, I think Rosie Huntington their name. I thought Irish music month Pinkman. Yeah. She's married to Jason Statham. But is that that's her name? No, that's a different guy. Oh Rosie Huntington. Yeah, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or something like that. Yeah. She was in  Mad Max which is a amazing movie. I thought anyone I didn't like it. You don't like it. No, did you see in theaters? Yeah, don't worry Tom Hardy. Yeah. That was awesome. Did you see that? I did did you like it? And I have an opinion? Well, I saw it alone in the theaters appreciated it. I mean it was cool. Unbelievable. All those were practical effects. I mean like it was I'm not gonna say it was bad.  Is didn't like it but it's awesome wasn't my cup of tea and I've seen the original one and it didn't really like that one either. I don't like like the it's not huge Mad Max prison. I thought I just like the effects in this one. I thought was really really cool and the Medigap - I stand by what I don't like her. She's good. I liked her in the Seth MacFarlane movie The Western A Million Ways to Die in the West that was all that was funny. I love that was really funny. What other movies is she in? She's in like something Tony.  Girl version of like a James Bond or something. Totally. She's in Tully monster. She plays like that came out a couple years never heard of these movies. She's in a lot of movies. She's good. She's a good actress. She's just don't know. What's another movie.  I can't think of anything. She's in besides the seven for the movie and Mad Max how many Transformers have it all the new Bumblebee movie was awesome. Really really good. And yeah, I like hailee Steinfeld. No, she's good. She's really good in the plot. Apparently, it's supposed to be a prequel to the first one, but I hope it's not because I want them to like create a whole new Flat Line. That'd be really good. I just think they should stop making Transformers me if you saw this one you'd hope they just because it's really good to me.  And it's completely reveal their own bubble b-two, it's Bumblebee versus like Starscream or something. That's dumb. It was good. Yeah, but it often but they like make you wait. So it's like they don't show you everything at once and then I think they're going to if they make another one they might bring Optimus Prime in but at spoiler alert at the end of the movie at the end of the movie he turns from the Volkswagen Beetle into the Camaro that Shia LaBeouf fines.  That makes sense. Yeah, so that's why I think it's he buys his car. Who's the guy he buys his car from it was Bernie Mac Bernie Mac before it turns into that car. And I think it's a pretty cool. I read a couple places that it's a prequel, but I'm not entirely sure that it is a pretty cool. So I hope it's not Michael. Mae's not doing it. I'm not seeing well, he didn't do it. I know I know it's way better it so much. It's the best. It's the best Transformers fast. Although I will say the coolest Transformer scene of all the movies.  Is the second one when Optimus Prime's fighting Megatron and Starscream in the Woods by himself, and he's he's winning at first but then he gets like his arm cut off killed. Yeah, he gets killed spoiler that by now. Yeah 15. That's the coolest movie in Transformers the hole  sir series whole thing. It's the coolest seen not disagree. What's your opinion? When Optimus said stick the Cuban my chest when Mark Wahlberg finds auction starting I started having like an emotive. Juban bar trust that one. Yeah. I started just bawling I weeping but he doesn't but it if she doesn't do it and that was the sad part was willing to sacrifice himself for the human race. Yeah. Did you see this?  Fight, why would you now he's in his own head? We should just do a Fear Factor episode where we just put landed just lock me in a dark room put some night-vision cameras in there. Just see what happens you feel like Paranormal Activity. He's thrown around the room being be split.  slamming my shoe against the  Some of the ground for Grand bottom the ground the ground and didn't hear him singing. I feel after that so scared they probably were it was the Beast it was me.  I'm gonna find your NightLight. I swear to God. I think I lie there you'll never find her. That's what we need is another taken not taken taken for that before five. Take taken 76 just taking every year. What are the post of the first one is daughter gets taken, right? Yeah second one, who knows, you know? No. No, I have seen the first one second one second one second.  Being his wife right Joe's daughter has to come save him. Yeah, so what's the third one?  I don't know but I how many times do you like? Music How does it go? That's John Wayne? Yeah, great. Oh Liam Neeson has him he's never played a different character other than Qui-Gon Jinn then that I can find you and I will kill ya he was in Love Actually.  What he was in love at? Yeah, he wasn't actually I can't confirm. I don't remember that but he was the same character. It wasn't made by a Korean would come in and kill both of them.  Pressure one punch, man. Can I get a real legend? John Wick versus Liam Neeson from Taken John wait, probably right? Yeah. Probably gonna make it right put my money on junk even though I never seen each other. What's his character's name in Matrix, Neo Neo. Yeah. Well, I think Nia would be about anybody. He's the one but like we should have a bracket of just like movie came out to be cool. They would just be like superheroes like a character like  Somewhat realistic movie right? Cool the 10 versus Tony the Tiger who wins in a fight. All right. Yeah, he wins in a fight in a fight. You know what you know what the Kool-Aid man does he throws Tony the Tiger in him and that turns upside down so he drowns. He's break the glass where he puts rat poison in the Kool-Aid just a nice refreshing glass of you like raisins. Kool-Aid Tony be like they're right.  Yeah.  Got some calls how thick is that glass though?  I don't know. I don't know the dimensions of the going on in the cold.  If you can if you can break the glass and he wins that's the only thing you need to do. Okay. Well, I mean he could just drown to it looks like that's what I was asking him throw them in there and then turn upside down so he can't get out. Wait. Has anyone ever seen a cat swim?  oh tiger Swagger's women are looking for bubbles are art Superior than  Those two pressure Fruity Pebbles better than Frosted Flakes. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

I have like a fear of Martian ever since I saw you.  So would you rather fight a shark or more small the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man? Well, I probably rather file D up a shark just stand on my own land just like well, I think I would have  And this year I know that was an oval. That's my favorite SpongeBob episode of all time.

Yeah, but not like their own like not their own cereal. Yeah, they have their own cereal and it's really good and it's been around for a while. It's interesting. I didn't ever really thought about that till now.  The fun Stones must be rich maybe have you seen the live up to John Goodman live-action Flintstones. Terrible. Terrible movie terrible great movie never seen it but I've been different that's not good. It's just simply not good. It's all practical effects. Even the dinosaurs. Not good. Sorry. Jurassic Park was way better. Oh, well, I would hope so drag probably know what's really really going out on a limb.  First what between the two Jurassic Park in the Flynn's live action film sense really drastic. I just didn't think like they're that like Jurassic Park is that realistic just because dinosaurs are extinct. So wait, how many finding this year the actors? You can argue that it doesn't take place in the Jurassic period that's I think that's my point. It created it. They created the dinosaurs now they didn't yet, but they did but they didn't that's the premise. No, have you seen dress?  the preseason Rasik laugh to real  I'm just questioning. I how they made that possible.  We're trying to explain it.  The T-Rex won an Oscar for that movie. That's why I'm saying they took where do they find the answer? There's it took real dinosaurs. I'm with you I'm with you. Oh, I see they know he was a suspect. It was real dinosaurs. Yeah a real dinosaur. They all one like some kind of award. There are fantastic actors. I thought rafter number two good kind of screwed on the supporting actor. Yeah. I liked it. Yeah, I got real political about it. Yeah, that's a mistake. Yeah, they got to give to the Triceratops.  Did you like the Chris Pratt? I like the first one I didn't see the second one. I heard while of the first time I like the second one. He was great the dancer on that one. You can tell he really spent a lot of time on his character really develop your own method actor. He's here method. He's very good method actor.  The first one was good and then the fight between the T-Rex and then the whatever Predator well then here's a fantastic the indominus Rex something like that. Yeah the abdominal Rex. Yep. That's was no school because I was like a callback to the first one with the T-Rex. Yeah. I know the plot was good. Chris Pratt's just good actor. He's funny can't really go wrong with him.  It's good. I miss old so old fat old tractor sale. Did he sell out and get hot? Yeah, of course. Yeah, that is a part of selling out is getting hot.  I would sell out I'd be the biggest selling how much money would it take for you to sell out right now.  Well, Define sell out. I don't know. Okay, again hot. Leave your friends even job my friends leave my job. Yeah, but you get hot, you're famous. You get rich. I leave all my friends.

I had like a billion pretzels and it made one big pretzel out of this Millie pretzels and it's the best job I've ever had and then I woke up it was gone and he's back to the darkness back to the darkness and I can never sleep for 3 weeks could never sleep for three weeks good. So you could never sleep or you couldn't sleep for three weeks. I couldn't sleep for three weeks. Oh,  that's a long time. So yes or no, would you leave your family? No, I don't think so. I love my dog too much. Is it still you could do you could buy every dog. Yeah, if you got to take your dog with you and only your dog, no way. I don't want my dog my dog. So do I get to take you with me? You could stick yo, yo, that's it. No, you get to take a look at yo. Yo, yo ass is dead. Can we negotiate?  Die but yo-yo can come. Oh, I would never wish death upon a living creature except for the dinosaurs.  God this is so hard yo-yo comes but should it but she gets super skinny and like really and shapes which is not as fun to cuddle with anymore. No. No, that's a deal. That's a deal breaker. You get you get a billion pretzels look Joe dies, but you get to take your your with you and then no one else and a billion dollars and a billion really impressed and a billion dollars. Keep coming over here more offers. That's it. That's three look exhausted. I think really that's out of the box and really talks coined you can have  And look at your house today.  And what's your dog's name? Yo-yo has to go with you. Yeah, but then I'd just be sad all the time because we always with you money can't buy happiness. But yo-yos with you. Yes it can but yo-yo is pure happiness. The dog is built of happiness. I've never understood money can absolutely but happiness.  Are you serious? This is gonna give me a billion dollars right now. I'd be pretty happy lot of depressed rich people. I'd be fine. I did buy something else you get bored of yeah, you're just bored of all the things you have Rock. I'm concerned. You might have a heart attack before you can even spend your money.  Maybe the amount of Coca-Cola I could have yeah, you just have my yacht I could be the CEO of coke. I could buy it. That's what would make you the CEO. Yeah, would you just be the owner fair enough? You can appoint yourself. See I would I would buy Atlanta. That's why I would do it, but I would destroy it could even afford the state because the worst off.  Lost at sea birds never had the stupidest Stadium. I'd rather play at the Birmingham Legion Field. Yeah, you know, you know what they're rather plant Auburn Stadium. Ah, Bobby cook yo-yo would you go or yes or no?  I had no answer. No answer the question to do that tune in next week to hear my answer or you could ignore the billion dollars and the pretzels and just keep everything. You got know. You could be Sanders. Would you take it? Oh absolutely loved but everybody, you know has to die. Yep. No, but you have to snap when you snap your family doesn't know half of your family does you don't know what you have? Oh.  They could all die favor. Everyone has an individual 50/50 chance of dying. Your whole family could die.  Aah splashes are so hard where your entire family lives except for yo. Yo, yo, yo gets evaporated or whatever turns in - but you're Santa's but everybody's around and then when you think about yourself and know so just by so I wouldn't be able to get the tax Orbiter Brandeis my what tax return my taxidermy taxidermy.  I mean technically everything is about you. That'd be pretty good because I can say who do you think you are running round leaving scars collecting your Jar of Hearts?  during moving part  and then that could make it like a little joke, but I'd really be sad because yo-yos about your dead dog. You're singing to the ashes of your dog. Why are we talking about my dead my habit?  No, probably not. I can live with that sacrifice. That's her. I mean I'm talking about like my immediate family or like everybody in my family.  That know anybody Peridot or anyone, you know, anyone I know currently. Yeah, I don't like you guys anyway fair enough would you know, you can't talk to anybody, you know?  billion dollars  You don't even think about it. You know you yeah. Okay, they just kind of finagle your way into being friends with Drake. Oh say no more. I mean, I mean you just put you just fun to Drake's new album. Heck. Yeah, I would do that. I don't think he needs funding for many more in the rough edges if you could live in that 250 million dollar house though. Yep, that's exactly where I would live if you could bring  Five people you know with you. Could you bring did I know? Yeah and then we'll go will you like you don't know but hypothetically could break till it with you.  Well, this is gonna get me in trouble after the answer because that's what we do you to do you check out every family do you?  Okay relatives. I wasn't going to take any more people that I know so you do right or yeah we go. Okay. So yeah you too. I'll think about it.  Does it count that I have met Diane Williamson twice G would would he know anybody I know but I know him.  Hmm you too.  I'm gonna have some upset people back home.  Now they wouldn't care they might.  They might be listening.  We get it for viewership.  Five people five and not including yourself. Well, including yourself or not, including not include myself in five to five new people. Yeah you too. There's a name sticking of doubt my head but it's like to not bring and it's just the first round. I know you're thinking right? Yeah.  Stuff that is tough. You got to think about who you're living with and then you have to think of compatibility. Yeah, you are in like a hundred thousand square foot house though. So it's like you could go days without seeing each other. Yeah. Well, you have your own masseuse, so no one's going to be tense because someone's can be massaging you at any point at any day. Well that was a little rapey know there's a masseuse. There's something I know, but anybody can Define weddings  And I got you to get this there's a lot of stress relief opportunity in the house. Yeah. Yeah because they're people cooking for you cleaning for you. I think my biggest stress relief is that I'm in a $250 million to $50 million living in a big cardboard box. You still haven't decided if you're coming or not. That's true. Yeah. Think about it. You too.  I don't even know if I'd bring you. I'd bring your dog with me and not you. That's that's fine. But I was just vandalized your house.  There are some people who would be like good to live with but the same time like wouldn't be very like fun. You said who would I'm saying names? All right, say some names on of all right.  We're coming to you next. Let's see what surprise for my answer Patrick Whitfield. Oh, yeah, doesn't that inspired me? I'm going to show him this to me like you're coming to my house. He would be one.  He might he be the one to say no. I'm not gonna I'm good, you know.  So your third, yeah, that should be good. I don't want to bring Matt. Sorry Matt. No, he wouldn't want to come maybe not he was just beyond my putting green all freaking day.  Maybe Lucas maybe Lucas. I don't know. I was living with Lucas. He's great and he laughs at me a lot today. He made fun of us a lot. But yeah, like condescending. No just like really hurtful things. Yeah, he's very direct. He's really knows how to get under your skin is like all the right things to say.  Well, well, well if you would just destroy everything but I could get him his own little is a little bit on how to destroy. Yeah, he'd have his own little distracted. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Like we gotta put him in a padded room with yeah, I do. I really do I think perfect for you.  What am I four five? That's fine. Maybe that's two notes for this doctor with with Phil and and well Lucas. Yeah, that's five. Yeah, I think maybe my father.  Maybe I might bring somebody from back home. You will Loop Christian to my later.  Yeah, can I pick one of them? It's hello. Luke. See Loop would get married really soon as he loves his girlfriend. So he'd leave so beyond why even bring you same with will for sure be fun. I'd bring him if I brought some way from home. Yeah. Okay. Well you want but you may need you have five friends to bring.  I'd probably bring my family. That's it. No, I said no bro. No family is worth it.  I probably we take this time to bring you this message brought to you by frosted flakes. Hey, Kool-Aid Kool-Aid bring my girlfriend. Sometimes I believe it's a safe answer. You know, it's very safe answer. No you wouldn't.  Every my dog, okay, not a blood relative. You never know. You're right. You're right. I feel like to be honest that was up. That would be all you would bring. Yeah, that's it. Now you bring us now because you just didn't have any friends. So I didn't say that. I'm one of your friend I said, you don't have any other friends. I'm sorry.  I'm going to bury you alive. I'm gonna lock you in your darkroom pipes. Take away your night. How would you be able to do that? Because you'd be underground so  Andres who would you bring bring YouTube Fletch Adrian. How about no. No. I don't want to come.  And I'm thinking wait Phil because that's a good answer. Yeah, right. I'd be awesome. He just keep me entertained with his Pantry or sure.  Yeah, you too, Adrian Fletcher Whitfield. Okay. So you're in your 250 million dollar house. They just opened the movie theater for you go in and they say you got three movies. What are you watching three movies for the rest ever know just like that like the first three movies replays I could watch not like that are coming out new Dark Knight trilogy The Dark Knight three times.  And honestly probably watch The Dark Knight and watch The Dark Knight Mad Max. Maybe I want to add want to see action Mad Max be the one you wanted. Yeah, I don't want to see action movies in there and maybe Transformers had one watch the Scooby-Doo Scooby-Doo to and then I want to watch monsters Unleashed again. I think so you'd watch one of them actually.  Better that makes sense. That makes butterfly development. Yeah, because like, she's me creepy a human called memorable characters. Let me tell you and the dark when they go to the mansion. That was great. I love this scene where she where they heck out of them a little ball. She has the makeup kit and I was really clever. I like that and then when Scooby-Doo puts on the boxers ruined ruined you redo Roble, that's great. How many times have you seen that movie? How old are you?  Almost twenty three Seventeen times. What is my what you choose 10 mm 27 times so you pick you said The Dark Knight Mad Max and Transformers and has been through probably Transformers to know I'm taking my entered be Scooby-Doo one Scooby-Doo to in Transformers first one because I just think action movies would be really cool to watch their first just to get a good feel.  Mad Max by one of the best ones. Oh, no, who am I kidding? Sorry Mad Max Transformers Avengers Infinity War. Oh  just to see if Anna's on the big screen. Yeah, just to see Big Daddy on the big screen. Oh speaking of Big Data Django be a good one to watch speaking of Big Daddy - that was a good one Star Wars Star Wars movie you hope. Oh The Last Jedi first just watch the worst movies ever. That's suicide.  And what terrible obviously The Princess Bride it's an awesome movie which is a great movie stop. Okay. Okay. This is coming from the one who watches Supergirl. So let never yeah what with how good is your opinion here buddy? As Supergirl is underrated. It can be corny. But if you just stick a lot Sky great apply, so it's it got really bad.  I would I would say Empire Strikes Back probably the first one I want okay, because that's my favorite Star Wars movie. So that's one what were the other nope? Nope scratch that I would watch all three Lord of the Rings consecutively. So turn our streets.  Sleep with him getting so big third one's good. Oh my God first visit and yeah, they just don't and I mean they're long, but that's why people this is not realistic.  That's your be really a giant time. You said you would watch Transformers. That is so much more realistic. How is Transformers more realistic than one of the Ring my God because they're from an alien robot planet named Cybertron. What about that or in Middle-earth? Yeah, which is just a fantasy world. Yeah. That's my point. I'm defending you understand. Okay, I was like that's not our world. This is supposed to take place in our world. This is much more unrealistic assumptions.  Cybertron that's you. Don't watch Game of Thrones see okay, but now hey game with friends like you go. Well, we can have a conversation about you.  He just doesn't like the whole swords its rewards and incest like normal. There's no incest in The Lord of the Ring is incest in Game of Thrones. Yeah, but like is plot. It's part of the plot. Yeah weird. It's a plot driver. That's that's all it is. That's all right, you get over it. Incest is natural where I come from. Oh, that's that's true. Yeah, Alabama, that's not a friend of that was like, hey, it's kind of skyrocketed viewership.  Amen brother this is a show I can watch I can get on board with this Hey sister cousin.  You gotta listen to this day podcast, they're talking about it so we can tell my daughter brother brother sister mother. These guys are real funny real funny guys.  Did I tell you all this Conan O'Brien found out that he's like how would you react if you found out you were a product of incest, I'd question my entire existence. I'd have to figure out where that incest took place.  What it feels like not that long. I don't know you miss me. I don't know. That'd be weird be a good conversation starter. No. No, that'd be good conversation starter. Worst a have a nice to meet you. I'm a product probably freak out. That would be an awkward. Are you doctors? Like hey, hey, what time is it?  Good about I could if I get it about this one, right? Yeah. Alright. Alright guys, that's been our first episode of the 112 show. Thank you guys for listening that was kind of an unscripted first episode. That's fun. Little conversations are wow, it's really been an hour. Well, if you stuck with us for an hour, God bless you talk about in your own thoughts is really really really slow. That's a cool into their spacecraft. Thank you for listening guys. All right.
Hello everybody and welcome to the casino show for November 14th, 2019. We have seems to happen for today joining me we have for the first time a PC Gamer contributor do a lot of great freelance stuff for us some lovely features including one of my  It's about the eso player who lies on Bridges. I'll link that in the check that you got to read. You haven't it's a Lauren Morton. How are you? That's me. Welcome good. Good looks we're happy to have you on here and you're going to be joining us to talk about some Red Dead Redemption stationary. Yeah, some good times good times and rounding out. The Posse is Chris Livingston staff writer.  Also written many things for the website. Would you believe it? How are you Chris? I'm good partner howdy. Oh, yeah, I forgot we have to be role-playing this entire show. I don't know. Yeah, so the best I didn't practice my accent. It's a pretty good American accent you have going and I think that game takes place in America or some version of it. So it's like I think you're on point. Yeah good show today good show.  Every day we're going to be talking about the big horse in the room Red Dead Redemption to we kind of touched on it last week. But this week we finally have been able to spend a significant amount of time with it. So we've experienced plenty of performance issues and and responses in that regard will be covering spent a lot more time in the multiplayer, which I think will be sort of the heart of this this episode and  All of us have sort of so Lauren you've played just kind of scraped the beginning of the story mode. Is that right? Yeah, I just started a bit and then I was tempted to join the Posse and I haven't gone back to single player understandable understandable and Chris. You're around chapter 3. Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of I guess I did the opposite I was playing only online and then once I started playing the single player mode, I haven't gotten back to online like oh, it's so much better and single-player. The world is full of people and detail that's not there and you know online so I haven't been back yet. We scared you off line the come back. Yeah see the pile of corpses. I'm sure we'll mention that's the point. Uh-huh. It's kind of a different different mood depending on what your goals.  Our or the Twisted minds are playing with and I you know, I I finished the game way back when it first came out on PlayStation 4 and I'm around chapter 3 on the PC. I won't be playing it through all the way again for review, but I know it's good mostly been spending time multiplayer. So let's talk about in terms of Red Dead will be doing a segment on the best sounds and PC gaming. It was a question of the week was at this midweek question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Chris & Co collated a bunch of great sounds and PC gaming I didn't contribute but this is going to be my contribution and listen to those on on the stream. I'll link you guys the Articles you can listen along. I'm think I can play them for you. So I'm talking to you to my guests, but the listeners will be able to listen along and we'll talk about why they're good my we like them or and maybe some other sounds that come up off the top of our heads.  Yeah, but before any of that we're going to do highlights the week in news quiz, but let's begin with highlights of the week. And those are anything in piece of gaming whether something we played something we heard read smelled even that has to do with our Hobby and that we think is worth sharing. So why don't we start with a first-timer Lauren was your highlight of the week? Should I pick something odd or something less odd? I came prepared with few options you can  Film both out if you like, you know, okay. Well, I would vote fraud. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a breath. Okay, then quickly. The less odd thing is that the stardew valley update one point for coming later on in the month. It's been over a year since the multiplayer update which is the last like official one. So that's exciting. He's calling it The the everything update because I guess everything has been touched in this update. So I'm psyched for that. I've been looking forward to it collecting all the news for months as little.  Things come out and my odd one. Is that about an hour before this show over the weekend? I wrote about yes your grace the the bad King bad dad, you know management kind of game that's going to be coming out later and I joined their Discord just kind of on a whim just to see what they were up to and then never left and I got they like have you joined a house? So I picked one at random, you know, one of the Kingdom's in there.  Lore, and then today at around like 11:30 my time. I got and every and everyone ping from that server and just I was like what is going on? So I went to go check and there were 50 people and voice chat and they were running a live roleplay wedding in their setting and it turned out I was in the the kingdom that had been locked in the dungeon. We were all in the dungeon.  Had a secret chat just for us to coordinate an escape plan. I had not been keeping up with that throughout the week, but it turns out it involved wraps and we had two princes getting married, which it was the the event and then a king died. They poisoned the wrong person as part of their escape attempt by mistake. It was wild. I didn't know it was going on. I recorded the whole thing, but the idea of like Indie developers running args and weird role-playing things before their game even comes out is  Fantastic to me and I was so glad I got to wander into the worst Escape plot. And when we escape the dungeon, we all spammed rats in the chat because we were pretending to be rats in the dungeon apparently, so that's that's my weird highlight of the week. That's fascinating. What's this game called again? Just for people whom I know. Yes, your grace. Yes, come your grace and that's not out yet. It's not out yet. They are there beta launches. It's an open Beta you can sign up for on their Discord tomorrow.  Auro, which I think is why they were running this today and based on what I've heard about it. It kind of reminds me of playing rains and rains Her Majesty, which I love being bad up and uncovering secrets in so we'll see that was it was a fun event. They put on today was really there was Minstrel music in the background in the chat. They had just like minstrels playing even while people were dying. So it was grand sounds like a great Community shit. Yeah, Chris. What about you?  Yeah, so I played a bit of a game called yoga which just came out this week. It's a action RPG with kind of some very light roguelike elements and also some light kind of branching dialogue and kind of a little reputation system for this character you play who's a blacksmith who's had one arm cut off by a witch and you kind of run around run around in the  World kind of trying to have as our who wants this Golden Apple that's as much as I know about the story so far except that every time I leave in addition to looking for this golden apple, and also my grandmother tells me to find a wife while I'm out there too, but I'm only mostly just found monsters and bandits and I fight them. I have a hammer one hand in to replace my missing arm. I've  I've got a pitchfork that I can now use as a grappling hook you can kind of craft weapons and tools and things in fact my hammer, which was just a hammer. I found some silver or and now it's a it's like a big Silver Cross that hurts kind of cursed creatures and things so I'm still very new. I haven't played a lot of it. But one thing I really love is the soundtrack and especially the combat music which I have discovered is  Is from a Romanian hip-hop group there called and I'm sure I'm going to pronounce it wrong, but sub-sub karpati, I think but the music is great. It's like this weird kind of Russian hip-hop with a lot of strings and it's very exciting and unlike the reason I kind of looked into it is because the combat sections are often very short running around flinging a hammer around and  Killing giant bugs and monsters and as soon as the common enzyme like I want to listen to that music more so I looked it up. They do sell the soundtrack. So I bought that immediately. Is it on bandcamp or something the soundtrack is well, the game is on Epic the soundtrack is also an epic. I assume you can maybe buy it by music from this band somewhere else. I'm not sure. I just bought the stuff from the game itself, but it's a fun game. It's  Very kind of got this like Charming art style and it's fun the conversations. You have our fun and I'm curious to learn more about like some of these decisions. I'm making like I'm trying to be kind of good because I want my reputation to to stay up for as one example. There was a giant chicken at one point blocking my path and I had to as you do find an enchanted corn cob to feed it so it would move.  Move to how stuff yeah, of course. So I kind of had the choice like I could steal it from the sleeping guy or I can wake him up and see if we could come to some bargain on if I could have this Enchanted corncob. So there's like little choices here and there and apparently they do affect how people react you in the world. So yeah, it's been fun so far. It's called The Yoga right on. Yeah. So listeners I'm playing you guys can't hear it. But YouTube I'm playing some of the music in the background and yeah this  This is good this as the kids say Bops possibly slaps. I'm not laughs. I where we at. Yeah boxes, maybe a little I think that's like 2015 like we're slaps territory now, but it does that ever knew about Bob's. I guess maybe I made that up. I've had people tell me I think I just made makeup history of you might be thinking of like 1915. Okay. All right. Yeah, this is a one more time. This is the game does yoga  Yes, and this group is Sub. Karpati sub car, PA TI.  I'm like, yeah, and it's not just the combat me like all the music is really good. There's just different things for different areas of the world. And but I really the comment music I really enjoy cool. That's why it's like this medieval setting and then you have this like really high paced hip hop kind of feel to it. It's kind of cool right on good highlights so far mine is mine is less exciting, but I've been trying to like my whole guess. Well, you know, I got to I suppose but  There's an outdoor hiking theme going on in games for me lately and part of that is expressed in Red Dead, which I think can be what I like about that game and I'm like trying to parse this and we'll talk more in depth when we hit that in a second. But a big reason I like it is because you can do the wacky stuff we're going to talk about or you can go on these really lovely solitary like almost walking Sim that's really reductive like hikes.  Because the world is so rich and detailed that it's just nice to be in and sometimes it really captures that sense of especially at night a sense of like nature feels kind of imposing and threatening and real enough to long story short hiking and red feels good feels perilous and beautiful all at once. I hiked in real life recently and it was just a it was cool to like kind of get the same vibe from it.  And the cherry on top is like I've also been hiking and death stranding which is the full on hiking simulator. It's coming to PC later on obviously next summer when you hike and read it to you like walk or do you sprint I you know, that's it's interesting because I'm like, I usually have a goal in mind like sometimes it's like I just want to climb to the top of this mountain and I am compelled to take on the idea of like the role player and not  because because like the animations are so good and everything else that like, I don't want to Sprint to the top necessarily and just do the video game thing that I really slow down and soak it in either all my horse or not and like listen to the Ambient sound and just like try and be a  Take in the scenery and be something of a word I'm looking for a vacationer in the wilderness, but I'm also likes usually like trying to hunt something. So I'm listening for the sound of like a bear or whatever and the distance and like you're really it pays off to like slow down and like cut out the horse Hooves clomping or your heavy breathing and just like listen really pays off to do that. Yeah. I don't know like I think it's cool that it can allow for that and it feels  It doesn't feel like I'm really like forcing the game systems into a shape necessarily like an awkward shape. It's the pace of that game is you're rewarded for going slower and taking things slower. I think at least or suits that kind of play style. Yeah hiking just hiking games got a good hike and now it do good hikes the walking simulation.  Genre has really taken off it has but let's let's hop into a news quiz here and Chris. Have you done a news quiz trying to think he's been initially. I did one news quiz. Yeah. I did a news quiz on my lash right on Lauren. If you don't know. This is just a made-up game that have ripped off from every other Radio Show in existence where we take some headlines from PC Gamer and I remove a word or to rephrase them a bit and you have to figure out the missing term fill in the  And whoever wins doesn't matter because I choose in the end anyway, but we're just gonna put you guys on display and see how much you actually read our website and I never have to subject myself to this because you know, I know all this about the game ya bub it so I'm going to give this one to we'll start with Chris this time because this one's a gimme for you Lauren. Okay? Yeah. All right. Here we go news quiz starting.  He is getting a big version 1.4 content update on what day this month.  Hot cheese, I don't know. Let me see here. Let me I'm going to look at a calendar. I'll say the 20. No, I'll say the 19th.  What were you gonna say? I'm gonna say the 26th, but that's actually Thanksgiving. So probably not you nailed it which one there was the 2626 they're going with your gut there bud. Yeah the 26th at everything update that learned details. I think it's slated for the yeah that day and sounds pretty exciting. I don't was their detailed notes for this yet. No, not detailed. It just kind of random collected bits over the last few months.  Got you. Got you. So it'll be interesting to see what what yeah, what everything means. All right. This might be a good chance chance for me to actually play it because I bought it like two and a half years ago or something and every time I start to launch and I'm like do I want to do this till I really want to get sucked into this and I was closed so I haven't I'm too afraid to play it. It's got hooks. It's got hook. I don't blame them together. I guess one of the big maybe was you learn who brought this up?  Up in chat who said like there's a new screenshot button that will take an entire picture of your whole Farm. Is that one of these small but big like that's a small feature but people have been people share their Farms a lot. That's like a whole thing like showing your optimized farm and people have had to do workarounds to get like full parm parm pictures. It's a little thing but but realize that we should do like an updated gallery or something when that comes out of good Farms next question already.  For you, Lauren and official alien blank is coming out next month.  An official alien blank alien as in the franchise Ridley Scott's alien, an official alien blank is coming out next month. Oh man. I saw the picture for this and I've seen the headline and I didn't internalized it because I don't usually care about alien.  I don't know don't know it's okay. It's okay DLC. Not a bad guess whichever last alien game. It was isolation. Yeah, I think that what happened several years now. Yeah, it's been a while really belated DLC incorrect, but a nice guess either way and it's a bit misleading because we are PC Gamer.com, but this is a sort of a related to our hobby. It's a tabletop RPG is coming out next month role playing game with to play with  It's cinematic and campaign sinan cinematic lets you play through like scenarios similar to the film's in a session and the campaign takes over or sort of more of a Gloom Haven structure and lets players explore the Universe At Large for multiple sessions. That sounds kinda cool. If you're into that that Universe the universe what aliens in pretty wild can you play as Android because I'll be sweet I would hope so, that'd be cool. Be cool. So what they call them Androids in  well artificial person was what the guy said and aliens to he preferred the term, but it came here with the actual term is we need Andy Kelly here. I think it was Android these me. All right. Next question epic games is we're back to Chris here at the games has acquired blank a company and its huge library of photogrammetry assets.  That's a toughie. It's stuffy. This is kind of like inside baseball like like the kind of stuff that usually we don't it had an odd name. Whatever it yeah. It's quick Soul. They do quick song song of yeah. Yeah. So qixels founded back in 2011, and their whole thing is just capturing Real World objects buildings animal for all sorts of stuff that can be downloaded by game artists to use. It's kind of a big deal because epic has really streamlined.  Video game development engine and interface and all these resources available to developers sound kind of nice Unity does a similar thing with its Market of resources, but these high res Assets in unreal which you know, it sounds like a killer combo if you're trying to make games and that's an awesome job. Just take it out of like really awesome photos of textures and things that sounds so cool.  First time I remember hearing about it was the vanishing of Ethan Carter I think is when people started like being aware of photogrammetry and they did a Blog on like taking a bird Gillian pictures like going out in the woods and taking a billion pictures of rocks and stuff. It was pretty cool. Yeah. It reminds me of I did my interview with the CEO of speed tree which has trees trees and everything and like it's like, yeah, we just hired one hired someone their entire job is just to run around and take pictures.  Of plants and trees and bushes and I'm like that's the damn dream right above video games is great. But I just wander around with a nice camera and just chill with some trees. Sounds great. Alrighty that question John Carmack. We all know this person, right? Yeah. Maybe John Carmack is stepping back from Oculus to work on developing what that's this is gonna be full of stuff from like ice.  I saw that headline but didn't remember it. It's pretty fresh to be fair. This one's a fresh one. I edited the story and I'm trying to remember. Okay good. I feel a little bit better. How far back and slack. Do I have to go to see that to help work on a type of product stepping back from Oculus. It's not necessarily a product.  Say that.  That makes probably harder. No, I don't know. It's a line of Kitchen products. Can you imagine I would love to see carmack's kitchen line be like some really fucking logical perfect serve delicious. Yeah. I imagine carmack's knife. It would be like the knife the platonic knife you imagine in your head when you hear the word knife, it would be perfectly efficient for every an emoji. Yeah. No. No, he's working on stepping back from Iraq.  To work on developing artificial intelligence. So interesting. Yeah.  Let's see. Yeah, he's kind of he's quoted his talking about the work. He's done throughout his life is always sort of had a solution in mind or like an end in sight and need and he's quoted as saying here. I have sometimes wondered how I would fare with a problem where the solution really isn't insight and that quote I decided I should give it a try before I get too old. So he still Consulting CTO at Oculus, but the guy's gonna make the robots that kill us all yeah.  And they'll be very efficient vehicles all super efficient super efficient and probably can run Doom next question. Oh, this one's bizarre. All right, the Royal Canadian Legion commissioned a model of what in fortnight's creative mode to help it connect with younger Generations.  It was just a war memorial thing or something. Yeah, remember the name of it. That's my answer of the war the war memorial thing yet close enough. They commissioned a model of remembrance Island to help it connect with younger generations. And yeah, it's a war memorial. I'm not too familiar with a exactly every aspect of a Canadian Canada's history of War. But yeah, this was actually created it.  It's kind of eerie, and I wish I could show a video your of these this really austere Memorial in fortnight's wacky Colorful World. So you can go visit a war memorial as a anthropomorphised hot dog. If you like really really feel, you know, the history in your veins. It's it's you think it's successfully connected with the younger generation.  Raishin, it seems like a weird thing. Like I want to really connect with kids. So I'm going to build a war memorial and the kids are going to go bananas over it. I mean, it's like a strange strange thought it isn't strange thought and I think it's totally misguided and in intensely creepy. It's if anything it's like I've seen it in game. Do I need to go see it in real life now?  Right good representation. There's I don't forget tourism. Yeah. Yeah, I floss to the front of it in the game gonna floss in front of it in real life. It's yeah, it's totally something else. That's all you what but go watch the Lincoln Shack here the YouTube video that like demonstrates it is  I don't know. It says like know what does it say here a tribute to remember inside Fortnight. Once the other Splash image here. No battles. Only respect. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, very strange. Alright. Next question is a bit of a Twist here name three Google stadia launch games. They were revealed this last week name three. It's like I'm hitting your head and saying name 10 candy bars.  Who's next? Who's this? This is this is an Epsilon just so it's me. I thought it was Chris. I was like darn it. Chris keeps getting the ones that I might be able to do Destiny to mhm. Oh, I'm gonna get it mixed up as well with the other list of games that we've been keeping track of shoot. I said I could do it, but Destiny to Tomb Raider you'll what  To two meters. Well, okay. I'm not going to let you I'm not gonna let you do this. There are two Tomb Raider. There's three tomb Raider's so you could technically yeah and then a third Oh shoot. What else is coming? Is there an Assassin's Creed game? There is Odyssey. Yep. Yeah. Yes, you did it. Yeah, the official launch day lineup was revealed including three we mentioned guilt which is that horror.  I'm from tequila works correctly. I might be wrong Just Dance 2020 Kine Mortal Kombat 11 Red Dead Redemption to Samurai shodown Thumper and those three tomb Raider's so that's the 19th. I believe that's coming up pretty quickly. I just looked at that list like two hours ago. So I'm gonna be embarrassed if I couldn't find three it's not the most exciting list, but I don't know. We've kind of been talking.  King baby especially based on the AMA that happened already yesterday that it feels like stadia is trying to get out before the holidays in some form. It's a lot of features are missing too including 4K streaming HD our support on the PC at launch achievements some other things so  Yeah, we'll see how it goes. It's going to be fascinating. Either way. I like to the week James. Why would a Achievements not be there? Like what's the technical hurdle in getting someone in an achievement? Right. Well, they said the data is being tracked but the like the interface for it is not quite done or it's not going to be part of the launch. So, you know mmm, it's probably just a UI thing if I had to guess how these interface isn't finished yet.  Except this time not to not to like, you know, give these developers any crap. I'm sure they're working around the clock. It is just a very it's a weird first foot forward. Next question. Steam is having a blank day sale on November 11th. Let's do you know this one Lord, uh-huh some like singles day. Yeah singles day, I guess 1111  cuz it's all ones. Oh, I see. Yeah a tradition that started in China as a jokey excuse for blind dates and parties where Singleton's can meet. But now there's going to be a singles Day Sale. I'm assuming it's all about single player games. I'm assuming that's sort of the fun twist. Yeah, but that that excuse me that day already passed but it is a  Honey, it's kind of a nice little nod next question. It seems a toughie. I'm realizing I may be stacked all these against you Lauren. Okay, I can deal GTA V has sold five million copies since May for a lifetime total of what and I'll give you like some wiggle room here in terms of that. You have to like nail the number on the head, but I don't know. I'm so bad with imagining numbers. I don't even know how many millions is a lot of them.  It sounds like a lot this answer but it sounds like a lot. Yeah Reese. She said there's five more than there used to be. Yes. And when did it come out the first released back in 2013, like originally originally. Yeah 2013 thing that's old.  I don't know 80 is that a lot of millions? That's a lot of millions, but guess what? It's more it's more it's more than that. It's over a hundred. Yeah, because it a hundred and fifty a hundred fifteen million, which is that's a many that's a lot of million. I would say if I was going to think about how many millions is a lot. I would probably say a hundred fifty million is a lot of those. I just do not conceptualize big number, right?  Right. How many people are there? I don't I measure like in terms of my home state Montana which is like kind of just right around a million people. And so I imagine a hundred and fifteen Montana's like that's a lot a lot of them. That's a lot of people who have purchased this game. Just five million since what was it? May yeah. Yeah, that's for a game that 2013 that's pretty incredible that Lifetime on all systems.  I believe it is all systems. Yeah, PC is probably a good chunk of that though because that's where a lot of the life online life is but yeah, I'm just assuming I don't actually have no analyst or whatever but either way big big money for rock star. I can't imagine I don't think our Rock The Red Dead Redemption to will be the a similar Breadwinner. I don't think it's like culturally as embedded but it will still probably print a lot of money.  Company right on that's news quiz. Lauren wins for being a good sport. And you and Chris. You got a little I don't know. Chris wins it Chris actually win though. I didn't I don't know why I have to leave now. Yeah, thank you for getting tiny little Keepsake eliminated from the podcast. That's it. That's how it goes. Yeah, you get eliminate from the funny cuz yeah news quiz. Let's let's talk red dead though and really get into  To it because this is a big game. I think why don't we start with?  gosh, we just start with single player because we're both that's like the thing we can sort of just like get through because we're we haven't, you know, you two have not like satin it forever, but I don't know I guess my first question is  This particular Chris because you said there's a lot more detail and sort of ambient storytelling and character building and just like reactive stuff in the single-player. Can you maybe tell me a few moments or things that have grabbed you?  things that stand out I think I'd like first of all in general like this is the kind of game that I just sit around waiting for like I just love a big open world where there's a lot of different stuff to do but there's absolutely like zero pressure to do any of it in any given time, you know, once you get through the introduction, which is long which is like 90  Minutes or two hours or something. It's kind of like okay, you know, here's here's 10 things to do in your immediate vicinity, but there's not any kind of like you're not really shoved into it and you can just copy what you want and  Yeah like that. That's the kind of game. I like where if I feel like making some sort of progress It's there's a lot of options to do that with and if I just feel like doing my own thing like said taking a hike or going fishing or just like zooming out on the map and going. Oh, I haven't been to this spot yet and I'll ride there and if I want to just ride straight there I can do that. But if I'm looking for some distractions, there will be  Like a few along the way it's not like a far cry thing where there's icons throwing themselves at you. Yeah, it's more like oh sort of off to the right. I can hear something or I'll see a little blip of a little radiant encounter. So it's great. If you're if you want to do nothing if you want to maybe get distracted here and there or if you want to really get into some kind of, you know official mission. It's all very there for you when you wanted to be. Yeah.  Which I really love I'm talking about like finer details like how it I just kind of Wonder at this like there was a stage show in one of the cities that was like it was like this three at it was like an optional right? It's an optional thing. Yeah, it's tuned into theater. Yeah, and I'm like, okay, I'll go into this theater and you know bought a ticket and go in there and sit down you just going to sit in the theater and then  Someone comes out on stage and starts talking like the MC or whatever. Mmm, and then there's like a three-act show and there's like a fire eater and like Houdini type guy who catches bullets in his teeth and then there's like a four-piece band and it's just like I've been in there for 20 minutes just like watching the show with a bunch of you know, AI controlled citizens and  While you're sitting there, you can kind of interact you can you can like cheer or Boo or whatever. It's like react positively or negatively or whatever it was going on and there's all these little kind of lines and things that you can clap and sometimes you cheers and sometimes they shout something and so this third Act is the song. Hello, my baby, but before the song She's the the singers talking about the telephones this new invention that  I go now now if you don't want to be found they can they can find you, you know, you have no privacy and all this stuff and and I just hit the react button and Arthur he yells out the hell with the telephone. Hmm, and I'm like like it's this one line of dialogue that you can use in this presumably only this one situation in the game if you happen to have sat in a fucking theater for like 20 minutes and it's just like I love that.  That kind of like attention is paid to to to stuff that you know, probably most people might not do anything. Even if you sit there you might not react during that woman's 30 second speech about the telephone. But if you do there's something there that doesn't just feel like oh this is, you know, my reaction 3 where he Hoots or hollers or something. It's like a very specific bit of detail and that stuff is just so much fun and it  to feel rewarded for you know, really sticking your nose into a part of the game that maybe not everyone does and for for for a kind of hanging in there for that long, you know, you feel like they really paid attention to a lot of these kind of details which obviously is something you can do when you're can just dump a huge truck of money on to a game and yeah to a studio and have God knows how many employees  these that you've probably worked to the Bone for months, but it's that kind of I don't know that that's just very appealing to me. It's like, oh I did this thing for 20 minutes that required me to really sit there in a chair and there was a little reward for me because they thought of that so and like and I guess I'm more Grizzly note things like hunting, you know when you hunt it's very unpleasant.  You shoot a animal and don't kill them to the point where I'm like really very careful when I'm hunting because like I shot a deer and it was not a clean shot and it ran away and was staggering and was screaming and was flopping around and it was this horrifying experience. You know, when you when you shoot animals and other games they can react you'll see blood and they'll you know the run or they'll fall over or whatever, but this was like  Really upsetting it was like, oh my god. I've just horribly wounded this animal and it's shrieking and thrashing and like that changes the way I hunted from then on it was like I do not take a shot unless I am sure I'm going to immediately instantly kill the sound because I don't want to go through that again. And that's like like this another fine kind of horrifying detail that I haven't really seen in  In a lot of games. Yeah on that note like I noticed it really treats fight like the violence is  not the main draw to this game, which I appreciate but when it does it kind of like arrives in really rapid bursts unless you're like mainlining the story but even then but I was inspecting a it was in the multiplayer mode the online my nose just like clearing out a bandit camp or whatever and I inspected all the bodies like after the fact I went I was just saying I like taking their money in their stuff and  I noticed that they were all like arranged they weren't just like rag-dolled randomly according to just like lazy Fizz. I'm sick lazy that's in genuine. But you know just kind of like lackadaisical physics they want there was like a guy gripping his stomach and is like eyes were like glazed over and he had like this kind of Grimace on his face. Like he had dropped in a natural position like gripping where the bullet hit him and the other guy behind it was in this really like awkward his arm pinned behind his  Back like position. It was just like I was like, oh my God, this is this is really awful what I just did it gives I mean like you do a lot of murdering in that in that game and it is not like the most it's not like Last of Us 2 levels of look at what you did but that like that ambient attention to detail is there and if you really expect anything you're bound to Come Away with usually some kind of deeper.  Impression of it which I really appreciate and I think how that plays off in this single player mode that stuff like are three usually has a reaction to most of that ambient stuff or something to say because of the know what you call it the reactive highlight stuff. You can kind of talk to anybody or say stuff to anybody comment on a lot of things that are highlighted on the environment and it really like I don't know that stuff. I think more than the stuff he does.  Does in the main story modes or Camp campaign missions which are very like typical rock star fair not to I don't know. I find them a little disappointing because they are they don't really embrace the open world nature. But there they are good scripted like dance along missions. I find like Arthur's diary entries the things he says like in the third Act of a play that you don't even need to see or comment on all that stuff and meet Lee and  heads up this really like curmudgeonly, but guy who's just also full of a lot of love and has his really unique hopes and and fears and over the course of like this game is  Really really fucking long. Even if you like Mainline the start if you Mainland the story, it's like 40 to 50 hours and B. Then there's a like it ends and then there's another 10 to 15 hours of the game and like you Chris. I wouldn't recommend just like mainlining it that there's a lot to sort of of Random Encounters and side missions that some like fundamentally change how you perceive Arthur and the encroaching in  Realization and imperial arm of America. It's I don't know. I think it's a overall. I feel like the story is a really sort of sombre limitation about  The Fading Frontier as opposed to like GTA V is like almost like mocking and angry satyr ization of modern industry, so I don't know I think this is will move on to multiplayer now, but I think it is Rockstar's best story and some of the best characterization in any game ever again like it's hard to knock kavya with the fact that Rockstar is this huge industrial Force.  with with all the time and money in the world to do this and questionable ethics about how they, you know about their work culture and crunch and so on but it is undeniable that it adds up to something that's unlike anything else in my opinion, but  Anyway, sorry Lauren. I talked a lot there. Did you have your right at the beginning the story mode? Is there anything that like is catching your eye about it or or you just like mmm, I've barely I've only done just a little bit. I played like an hour or two the night before we all jumped into a posse together and the only thing Chris mentioning hunting makes me think of like in every game this happens any game that asks you to kill wolves inevitably you kill them and they sound like dogs.  And I've Got My Little Monster sleeping behind me. And so the the dog parent and me is just like I don't want to hear him scream. So they have you killed wolves in like the first chapter of Red Dead and like I'm not, you know, I'm not like anti shooting or violence in games like it's but I hear the the wolf screams and it cuts at this little part of my heart. And so I'm gonna want to kill anymore bulbs. Please. Don't make me do it again. Well and like Chris said like I've been ambushed by the many times and it  The typical video game encounter are I guess I can in most other games the Wolves would just be like aggressive AI enemies that kill you. They like just begun for you non-stop until you are dead or they're that  But in this like if you they will attack you and like your scare your horse and buck you off your horse. And then if you take one or two out, they will get scared or like limp away and shriek like you said and it's like, you know normally like in a you might like be in a game you might feel like this Vindication like I kind of get them all but I am like, oh God. What if I think of it? It's over. Yeah, let's let's just carry on. This is a terrible terrible thing that just happened. Yeah.  Written online. I think that's like the thing I focus the most on while playing for review and it just a brief overview. It's just kind of opens up the world to you and a bunch of other players to do kind of whatever you want. There are some prescribed like multiplayer activities like shootouts horse riding. Excuse me horse races some like changing playlists with more experimental mode.  Odds and some other activities like that. There's some like story missions to where you can cooperatively kind of do the typical rock star thing of writing to a place shooting some dudes and then riding somewhere else while characters talk and that's like all good and fun, but I think the creativity that the open-world allows for and just like the breadth of activities like really what  Is the draw like that's the draw and we all pass it up last Friday or something Thursday something like that and kind of just I don't know like the big like what defined how much I like this game especially online for me is the fact that we the big question was like, well, what do we do and we sort of just made up our own and we never answered that question. No, we were definitely never defined a no, it wasn't a frustrating question. It wasn't like  Oh God what you know, like we're bored. We got up doing things instead of ever deciding what we wanted to do excitedly. However, making very many conscious decision and most of those things like the things that we eventually well. Let's go here. Like I think we started off early just like let's go alligator hunting. I don't know if that was earlier later. Actually. It's all blur but alligator hunting just turned into this just the alligators hunted us. The alligators hunted us. Yeah first I think we started by  Through a series of events Morgan was hogtied and yes, what happened to just remain hog? He loved it tied up through the world and when we went up to go alligator hunting, I think it was his suggestion actually to be see if we could feed him to an alligator. Yes, which didn't initially work. The alligator did not eat his tied up self. Yeah so later he was eaten when he's not that up when he was just walking around in the water.  Looking for alligators. Yeah, it was like perfect comedic timing. I had like because if you use like the they call Eagle site. There's that Assassin's Creed whatever Eagle Eye you can sort of highlight herbs and animals in the area and there's like these tiny little like highlighted things at the surface of the water is like are those like plants or something and then one started moving as soon as the second Morgan says, oh, I'll just go out and check and the next second he's screaming and  Confirming yanked under the water. There are alligators. Yep. Yep. And so, you know, we we bagged a couple and played around in the swamps for a while. We also tried to do a dramatic like action car chase thing where we tried to have I don't know who was driving the carriage that point but we all got in and someone was supposed to drive it over the edge of a cliff and right I'll jump out and it turns out it takes longer to jump out of the carriage that any of us anticipated. We all tried at different moments and they were all the wrong moment.  Because we all ended up at the bottom of the clip is really tragic. There was just those I think one of the horses survived I just felt bad for it because it was just sitting there looking at its entire life just Up in Flames. I think it wandered off into the hills or someone took it but yeah all sorts of moments like that. I know prior to that like Chris and I will get to the corpse train and all sorts of shit in a second, but we decided  just go fishing because that's I mean that's like the other aspect right is you can just do an activity and the world is so believable and like flushed out and just gorgeous and the fishing minigame is like interactive enough and the fish themselves are diverse enough and like they're you know, there are big ones to catch and you can consider weight and size and all the things fishermen love to think about but we ended up just  Trying to commandeer a large shipping boat, you know, it's just kind of like this the world is so interesting in that way that you just kind of get ideas and they come up and thing you plan to do will probably not be the thing. Well almost guaranteed unless you are really really strict with yourself. It won't be the thing you end up doing which I don't I really appreciate that. Excuse me.  I kind of want to know if the theater that Chris mentioned in single player is in multiplayer because it's there I went in but there was nothing nothing plain. But is there is there an empty stage in a bunch of yeah, you can go and put on a show I think as I can imagine like I'm thinking of when Stephen did Arc role play like using that's what's in my head. I'm like someone's gonna do that on that stage like put on a whole show for a bunch of people.  Yeah, and I agree. I think that's like my chief criticism of Red Dead online right now is that it is it is like such as so much potential is this role-playing environment? It's the old west like who doesn't love that and plus you've liked nature. You've all these beautifully rendered old setting and so many roles to take on within that space What beat him a barkeeper some kind of frenzied mountain man who lives in a Shack in the  Words or or you know a stage performer. There's just not a lot built into it that incentivizes or gives you tools to really like inhabit that stuff quite yet. I know like GTA V has custom to save custom servers or what's I don't know exactly how the world. Yeah, I think it's like five em, it's like a custom modded server where Racha there's all these other extra function built-in like so  you can do different jobs. You can like work in buildings and you know have a taxi service and all these various, you know, you can customize a home with furniture and stuff like that. That's all been built on top of GTA. Yeah, bye-bye modders and special servers and it would love I would love to see that like natively embraced by Rockstar. I guess PC players will always like want to tweak and pull it that stuff. But out of the gate it would just be nice to  That stuff represented or or considered to largely supported with with Mod tools. I mean people are going to do it, you know Rockstar has sort of tolerated mods for a long time, but they've never really my opinion really supported them by by making it friendlier from honors, you know, if you if you want to use a GTA mod others, like five different things that got to download and different scripting things and yeah huge pain in the ass and that's not  Not in my opinion, that's not mod support that psycho will tolerate it and will you know sue someone if we need to but it would be nice to be like here are some tools, you know to give people some more access. Yeah to create things and make it a lot easier. I think it's because that I mean I role-playing communities pretty incredible amazing and some of our best stories the stories I hear in games come from that  I'm just pointing that but I think like still there's a lot of room for as we found out really fun like impromptu social interactions. I know I think my favorite thing. Well, I don't know my favorite thing, but the best thing that all posses should abide by is enabling Friendly Fire should all enable Friendly Fire because that means you can lasso each other up and I think Lauren what did you call it?  Lasso your friends like The Unofficial sequel to Mount Your oh, yeah Mount Your Friends hog-tie your passports iron pots or something. It's so true. We were in saint-denis but a lot of time hog-tying each other just putting each other on horses. Yeah. Well because it started with we killed someone by accident. It's not a person but an NPC we killed them and I wanted to just dump the body in the river. So I tied it up and put on my horse.  And then we started at some point just hog-tying each other because we realized if we turn it on we could and that's when Morgan decided to be a human backpack. That's right. And it's really didn't want to walk around. I loved it. It's fun. It's like I don't know. We just kind of made up a little game like hog-tying someone or like last week someone up hog-tying them and then if you're hogtied, you can like jam a button to break out and the game was like can I hog tie them pick them up and throw them in the water before they before they escape and you know, if they do Escape who's gonna  so who's going to get rope each other first it just and then like a couple other posses sort of showed up and we started just kind of playing with they did not like that game as much they use by any pulled out guns hog-tying bad. Yeah.  I think we had one little decent lasso fight with another Posse. I remember seeing I remember just just turning around and seeing several lassos all going at once and people just flopping over and jump back up and oh, yeah, I have clips of that. I'm pretty sure and it was just like it was like a big beautiful thing and eventually like because we were next to the train tracks the train came and out of nowhere. I don't know who we just said the train's coming get in front of the train.  Or maybe we're entertaining the idea earlier, but everyone like including like another Posse or to joined us and engaged in this like a game of corpse bowling. You might call it we all we let the train come at us everyone sort of screaming all at once over the proximity chat and our bodies go flying and then it like when you die, it'll freeze the frame and say death by or whatever.  And for mine, there's like eight or nine bodies including a horse or two just Frozen in the air and it says like James died from self cause of death fell like I don't know that's exactly what happened. Let's not argue. I think it was during our are hog-tying. Minigame. I wanted to put Chris on the train tracks, right I was going to do with him and then we just decided to I don't remember either I was too slow or so. I think someone killed me first well,  I was carrying Chris's hogtied body and then we just decided to do it voluntarily. Anyway, yeah, my favorite moment is when we decided Well, our bodies were still there when we respond including the horse bodies and I don't know who I don't know but we're like, let's do it again sort of just came up and Morgan becomes like this weird perverse like Twisted guy. I don't know like the things he says are not wrong exactly or alarming. Well, they're alarming but he just kind of like really into the corpse pile. And so yeah.  He had a we agreed to hog tie each other up and ask people to throw this on the corpse pile and people were lassoing their dead horses and bringing them back onto the corpse pile. And there's this moment where this guy I came over is it like Thomas Chen 89 or something comes by and goes? Oh my god. What have you done? What do you think? You said you killed half the town and you're like no. No. These are those our bodies. It's fine. It's cool. It's cool. And eventually he just joined us so he lined up everyone.  Lined up and we all go on the tracks again and is really funny. But then we were interrupted by another roving gang who were doing some Deliverance role-playing and asking us to squealing pigs and such a real original but the train came at the exact moment. So this is like a moment of panic where these guys are trying to kill us and Lauren you're like, well at least we're on the they killed us while we were standing on the train tracks. So mission accomplished everyone screaming over chat like it was just like a really rude.  Surd, things like that just happened purely by chance and you know, the the design of that world. It was just so bizarre. And yeah, the train came knocked us all once more into the void that one person was really concerned. He was like, I don't believe this is this is what really happened in the wild west. Yeah. I was like, I don't believe it. That's true history look it up.  Up. Yeah shortly after like that kind of like an the kicked off a big gunfight throughout st. Denis and it was just kind of killing each other randomly and you know screaming and Chaos confusion. And so I run through the streets and call for a ceasefire meeting the saloon meet in the saloon everyone meets in the saloon. It's kind of its really tense like Western scene, you know, everyone's in the saloon Morgan's by the buying drinks. We're going to find a bar. They take C partner grab me. Yeah.  And someone like starts talking shit and you can hear like, I don't know some argument break out. I caught like the end of it and suddenly someone's on the on the ground getting stabbed Morgan takes out his pistol shoots the person stabbing and just pandemonium. I didn't even see the first punch get throwed me and another person Throne. We're sitting at a table in the bag. You're having drinks. Yeah. Yeah, and then while the sudden screaming started as we both Sprint out the back door,  That was open next to us and just ran into the alley like nope not dealing with this. I don't know just a lovely like string of events that I don't know how else you replicate. It was like very, you know, we weren't like being punished for because death is like, you know, it's not a big deal and that game we weren't really being punished for dying, but everyone was being rewarded for just kind of playing along and goofing off and doing cowboy stuff or you know, like caricatures of  Turn genre stuff and that was great. It's touched up by the the absurdity of you know, the game systems like last time we see each other and stuff. So ragdoll physics. It did remind me of it's been a long time since I played the first Red Dead online, but the thing I remember doing most was like getting online with friends and then just deciding to go to a bandit Hideout and like killing everyone and then waiting for the police to show up and then killing them all to just seeing how long you could survive. It was like a  Remote right for but in red dad and that's kind of what we ended up doing by the end. We stop shooting each other and then just started shooting all the sheriff's that showed up to see how long we could all keep from dying. Yeah. It was like this climax to you know, like in one hand. It was like a horde mode absolutely and it was like fun in that way but it's also it's like big climax to like are weird. I don't know narrative Arc. If you want to call it something like a story. But yeah, and so I like that that stuff is possible. But also I can  just like choose to it's a persistent your characters persistent, but I can choose to also kind of have this meta goal of my own where I like. Oh, I want to save up enough money to hike into the the mountain the Grizzlies and find, you know, take out get the best Grizzly pelted possibly can which is difficult because you have to save up for a rifle some cold weather gear make sure your supplied and so there's like still enough of the Sim like the Western like survival swim in there, too.  Forced to consider long-term economic and survival decisions. I don't know. It's I am like super fascinated by this game and enamored and excited get back in. I will say it's annoying like the progression system like to get a fishing pole. It's locked behind like 14 levels 15 levels progression something like that. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. That's that's lock for like very, you know, seemingly very high.  Also, I just wanted I wanted to like make kind of like a nerdy Cowboy. So I was like wanted to get a bowler hat. Yeah, just like the idea of a bowler hat and some like, you know wire rimmed spectacles and the bowler hat is like locked until like level 17. Yeah. I don't even know how how far you have to go to get spectacles. There's like a slot for them. But there's no option anywhere. I think it's like level 40 or something I even went there's an optometrist shop.  In the big city and it was like said it was open from 6:00 a.m. To noon and actually stood there waiting on line seeing if it would actually open and it didn't of course and like I right next door has a doctor's office. I walked in there and he has glasses on I was like, I just want glasses. Why can I have glasses? So I think that's like really high level stuff in it. That kind of sucks because it's like it's just I kind of want to build the kind of character. I want now not not like after 40 hours or whatever.  But yeah, yeah, some of the stuff is locked. I think a little too. Yeah, and I guess the extra icky thing about is that you can bypass a lot of that if you have gold which is the premium currency you can earn a gold through some ingame activities, but really slowly so it's like I don't know it's frustrating. I just want to fish For Heaven's Sake and I have to like do other things forever if I want to do the thing I can just instantly do in the single will not instantly be no like pretty quickly on do in single player mode or whatever.  a lot of stuff just really arbitrary and ill-conceived in my eyes, but I think ultimately it doesn't get too much in the way of just like the possibility space and the impromptu improvisational  Shenanigans you can have I look forward to getting back in there and just toying with people or trying new roles on for size. I know like one of my favorite moments was a big gunfight was happening in armadillo or no of Blackwater and I just started carrying the bodies really slowly and solemnly to the the church graveyard and eventually both posses kind of caught on and one of them lined up.  Me as I carry their dead comrade to the graveyard and kind of like sat there in a row behind me as I dumped them. I buried them like threw them on the grave and over the mic the person attending their own funeral because they respond just as well. Thanks, mate. So yeah, I don't know there's a lot of room you kind of like get out. What you bring to it in some ways. Even if you have to kind of fight against that progression to to Really unlock a full Suite of role-playing tools.  and such but  It's cool game any closing thoughts are like things that we kind of glossed over. It says lot to unpack and we talked about first. I want to say like  anytime you hear something is a prequel to something else. I'm like hmm. Like I don't know maybe maybe I'm just selectively remembering but like nothing prequels are are great idea that usually seem to be like well now we can add in a bunch of you know, shoehorn a bunch of explanations for stuff that no one really needed to know but like as a prequel like I'm kind of into this like I do kind of I think they're doing a pretty good job of showing you some of these characters before  And what they were like before you meet them in the original and dead. So it's I'm pretty impressed with the with the story in single-player and stuff so far too. Yeah, I hundred percent agree and having finished it. I think it's yeah about as Rich a prequel you could ever ask for it's really something else. Yeah, you know, we're kind of cutting close on time. So I for to since with we kind of lost lost the stream there for a bit.  So I think I might save the best sounds and PC gaming bit and we can just kind of get through these two short twitch questions and I'll let you guys get out of here while we talk about Red Dead for a while, which I'm happy about say I will skip skip to QA. I'll save the sounds for another day. I think it's going to make a good second didn't contribute to that question. Anyway, I didn't have a good things. All good. I didn't either I was this was my way to make up so PC gaming questions.  We tend to prioritize questions from the PC Gamer Club to club PC Gamer.com to find out more but twitch chat if anyone's hanging out and you have questions about PC gaming anything to do with it, go ahead and at PC Gamer In twitch chat and if we have time we will or if we have any questions, we will answer them, but we have to hear from the Discord somewhere where they go.  Oh, they're so acid wolf is back with another hot men around and I love these. These are just like don't explain just answer its questions pick one from the following each the following three pairs. Number one walking Sim or immersive Sim.  Lobster Jim my God again or what? Am I? Oh I can hear you. Okay, the freak out walking Sim or immersive Sim. Hmm. I would say immersive Sim because you can usually get a little bit of walking Sim in there too. Fair enough I go walking some because usually they're actually narrative games and I like the stores philia. This is a diff tough one for me.  Immersive Sim. I love my walking soon as but I also love toys and and hacking that's what immersive same is. Just there's a hacking minigame. That's all it is. Number two action RPG or strategy RPG. What's the strategy RPG? I need an example. I can't think of anyone that might be that like getting like tactical like yeah, I mean Pete sometimes strategy and tactical Learners. I think like something like a  An isometric character-based thing where you're moving characters around and yada yada tactical role-playing combat like a Divini perhaps, right? Yeah versus action like a dark souls or a I don't know about action for me action RPG for Chris. I resent someone asking me to choose my favorite because all RPGs my children when you put it in turn when you call divinity.  Strategy game I have to pick strategy but I was going to say action because usually end up playing things like The Witcher or yeah Dragon, but mmm, I don't know I refuse to answer that. Okay abstain. I'll say action RPG because I love a good I don't know. I love the the feeling of a like a dark souls slowly improving your character. It's I don't know these kind of these sub genres have very different goals. So it's again, it's a tough one, but it's the point of the hot minute round is not fair.  Questions. It's just to make you feel pressured and stressed number 3 looters shooter or competitive FPS is easy one for me, but  I don't know really play much of either so I I'll say loot loot because loot is nice and I'm not that competitive and I'm not good enough at games to be competitive. So I'll go with loot. Give me some soup. Yep. I hung up my competitive hat as a teenager when I realized I was bad at being competitive in my Halo 3 days. So I also would say looters shooter. You know, I would say lunar shooter maybe goddamn. I'm not even following my own rules, but  I just feel so like Destiny to is burned me so hard. It's It Feels So exploited right now. And that's what I associate with leader Shooters seems like get out of here. So I'm going to say even though I don't like competitive games too much could they stress me the hell out competitive gonna go competitive. It's a political statement makes us well. It's a good question and we'll wrap with this question here. Mock's asks what genre  classic PC gaming question what genre is due for a Revival anything you got y'all been missing out on and these type of game from long ago. Well, I'll Bang the Drum. I always bang so well, we've already had right like Harvest Moon is come back right in the form of star do and we've had classic RPGs come back. Most recently. Those would be two things that I had wanted and now I have but  I always talk about Guild Wars 1 and I know it's kind it's almost an MMO. It was almost an MMO. It had a lot of it was very instanced and it was it was back in the earlier like heydays of wow, and I was Guild Wars player not a wild player and there's nothing like it anymore. There's nothing you're either entirely entirely MMO or the closest thing is Path of Exile, which is not actually close its Path of Exile is you know, yeah, right so  I want back a an online Social Hub thing where then I get to go out. I miss that you could assemble a party of NPCs to be all of your companions and your friend dropping as well it the you could sell low it or you could have friends you could mix and match it was great. And there's nothing that does it the same anymore. I would like a new Guild Wars one. That's that's good. That's a good pull. It's a good yeah deep cut there and you know what? I think I agree with you because that's like the last  Mo I really well MMO adjacent game that really clicked with me good call good call but you Chris I've been sitting here trying to think of an answer genre. That's not  Really alive and well, but I can only think of anything. I don't know. I would say adventure games but just go Elysium kind of the yeah kind of like satisfy that with also some incredible RPG stuff in there, too.  Yeah, I don't know. I'm going to go all the genres are great and many revivals because it's easier. Yeah, I feel like this question is asked as like bait for like for someone to say RTS games, but I yeah, I don't know like I don't consider myself.  You asked me the wrong crowd Mock's because you got a really specific deep cut MMO ish answer and to sort of like for me. I'm like, I'm just I just want games to be interesting whatever shape they take and that's my really like hands off just make cool stuff developers answer like I don't think RTS games or whatever need to come back necessarily unless someone feels compelled to make one and I don't know.  I think the digital Marketplace like it's crowded but it can it can Harbor all sorts of Niche interests and genres and subgenres. That's what's beautiful about PC gaming about our defense. Has there been a good tower defense in a while. I feel kind of that kind of feel like it died out.  I just want another Plants vs. Zombies because yeah, well, hey, I played a touch of the new one and I was it's the 3D whatever third person shooter one and there was a mode in it that sort of captured. It was like Tower Defense see in a lot of ways maybe a little too well to Shooter e for the same kind of one hand Mouse clicky.  Play but you're right. It's kind of amazing. They haven't just done another one of those but you know, that's that's are really ambiguous answer one really specific one and two really ambiguous answers full motion video horror the comes yeah, there it is that okay, I changed it. It's that it's that good God. What about the stranded? Genre guys the oh, yeah. Whoo. Yeah. I think it's a new genre. Not not.  I'm more of a stick. I like the stick genre not the strange on run. No carrot stick. This is all going to make sense when deaths training comes out and kojima's lack of subtext hits us all over the head whether you like it or not. I kind of dig it. Yeah, that's gonna do for today our show today. You could always catch us. Well, I don't have like a specific time slot chosen, but it is Thursday mornings kind of 9:30.  It'll probably have to be a little earlier if we want to get UK people on which is sort of half the goal of this new time slot as well. Yeah, 9:30. I think you can you can find us for most weeks twitch.tv slash PC Gamer. Hopefully we iron out whatever this internet issue is might just be my provider you can find us after the fact that youtube.com / PC Gamer or the audio version anchor doc anchor.com anchor dot f m / PC Gamer or our whole Archive of  Asks, and feeds on iTunes and Spotify and such a PC Gamer.com / tag / podcast. Yeah, that's gonna do for us for this week Lauren. Thanks for joining us. We'll have to get you on more often. Thanks for having me. Yeah, for sure and here for really specific answers. We'll get we'll get you on for the Guild Wars episode The Guild Wars 1 episode and Chris always good to have you of course it was  Fine, it was fine. Okay. Well you almost got voted off. So that's right. That's right. I'm lucky to have lasted this long watch your ass next news quiz, that's gonna do it for us. Thanks again for joining us will be here next week and until then don't forget to Lauren.  Like And subscribe doesn't know it either we end the show with a call to Game On so let's try this again until next week. Don't forget to game on.
Class is in session. You're listening to squat University by dr. Aaron horse Jake. Now. Let's start the show according to Trenton is manic depression settled in podcast listeners. Thank you so much for taking out Today Show. This is episode 53 of the squad University podcast that go with each and every one of these shows is to bring you as much value-packed content to help you move better in the gym and in life decrease our bodies aches and pains and help you reach your true athletic potential today. I want to do just a quick podcast centered around your mid back or thoracic spine. Now, why is this area? So important well in almost every type of barbell lift that we're doing ideal technique requires a certain amount of thoracic spine extension. Now, let's explain this a little bit. Let's start off with a little bit of anatomy. If you look at the architecture the setup of the mid-back if you're scrolling through an anatomy textbook like we got in school or if you just do a simple Google search mid-back the rest.  Six fine you'll get in anatomy photo and you'll notice that the mid-back is actually slightly rounded the opposite way of the lumbar spine. This is called thoracic kyphosis for all my science nerds out there. But basically the thoracic spine is a little bit rounded and it's naturally pretty stiff and stable now, it has to be pretty stiff because all the ribs that connect their help provide sufficient protection for all of our vital organs that lie close  Right underneath now, unfortunately poor postures that many of us assumed throughout the day especially for sitting down and starting at our iPhone with horrible posture. It leads us to adapt to having a stiffer spine and a more kyphotic or rounded upper back posture. Now why this is so important to understand is because when our upper back has rounded and adapted into this poor position, it affects everything else in the rest of our body, especially  if we're talking about the shoulder blade the shoulder blade will be limited and how well it can move. So let's talk about the shoulder blade for a second because you cannot talk about thoracic spine mobility and Anatomy without directly talking about the shoulder blade itself. Now the shoulder blade is basically a free-floating bone that moves on top of the spine in the ribs right there the shape of the mid-back therefore directly dictates the efficiency or lack thereof. It's movement whenever  We are going to lift. So for example in order for the shoulder blade to move correctly, let's say I'm raising my arm over my head or I'm going to do a push press so as my arm moves above my head that shoulder blade needs to move correctly and at the right time to provide stability for the rest of my arm so that I can get a good strong stable lockout. It has to easily glide on the upper back and why the mid back is so important in that extension that we want to get is because in order  in order for that shoulder blade to move correctly the right timing of it and be in the right position. It requires a certain amount of thoracic spine extension. This is the mobility that we often lack. So when you are in a rounded or flexed position whether you know, you just have crappy posture or whether you have legit adapted to that position it affects how well your shoulder blades moving meaning that you're going to have worse positions or less efficient positions for your barbell training.  Perfectly any type of pressing whether you're going horizontal or expecially going above your head with a jerk snatch oppressed things like that. So as you can see a weak Link in how the threats expired is positioned can negatively affect the rest of your upper body killing your performance and eventually setting you up for an eventual injury. Now when we address a weak Link in your upper body the mobility that restriction in the  the thoracic spine should almost always be tackled first before moving on to other areas that need help. So when you have done a proper screen of your upper body, obviously, we want to look at mobility and stability but things that pop up Mobility wise you could have stiff pecs you could have stiff lats, you know, things like that when you are doing that entire assessment if you find thoracic spine restrictions in Mobility, which we'll talk about here in a second that needs to be the first area you address before going on.  Two other things like the soft tissue work like the lat in think about it like this. If you're going to spend time and energy trying to fix like a broken-down house. You've watched way too much property brothers on HGTV and you're like, I think I could flip a house. So you go and get a house and it is a piece of crap ugly house your hopefully going to address the cracks in the foundation before painting the ugly walls, right just as the concrete.  That supports the walls of a house your mid-back sets the foundation for the entire shoulder joint. So like I mentioned before a stiff thoracic spine that is unable to extend sufficiently limit sufficient shoulder blade movement, which then affects the mechanics and stability of the entire shoulder joint itself. So if you don't fix the foundation first when it is a problem and instead you're trying to do other things first, you're missing the big  Picture you must fix the foundation first get the thoracic spine to extend and then move on to the rest of your upper body. Now, let's talk about like I said measuring threats expand extension. How do you even know if you're missing some Mobility that well extension mobility of the thoracic spine can actually be pretty difficult to assess on your own because it's composed of multiple spinal joints. Remember your spine isn't just like a ball and socket joint like your  ER or your hip it's a stacked linkage of small bones separated by desk. So there's a number of different moving Parts. But what we can do is we can actually measure rotation in that can give us an idea of how well the spine is moving and lead us to understanding whether or not we are missing something that could be limiting spinal extension. Now, this is because each spinal joint moves on top of each other in a very  Our fashion during rotation as extension. Now that can be a little bit difficult to understand but think about it like this. We have a very difficult time measuring spinal extension at the thoracic spine without bringing the lumbar spine into it as well. But what we can do is put ourselves into positions where we've sort of locked the lumbar spine or taken as much movement out of it into our for our analysis as possible and if you are limited in rotation to one side or the other your  Likely going to be limited in overall extension because rotation the mechanics that's actually going on at the spine on the right side. Like when you're rotating to the right side, if you're limited in that verse the left side, you're probably also going to have limitations in extension because those joints that make up your thoracic spine are not moving. Well, so here's a simple way that you can measure thoracic spine rotation. So you're going to tape an x on the ground with the edges forming 90 degree.  You're going to sit in the middle of the X so that the tape sort of forms a v in front of you going to put a PVC pipe or broomstick across your chest as if you're performing like a front squat and you can have a cross arm grip and you're going to rotate as far as you can to the right and left side now because you are sitting in the middle of the x that seated position with your legs crossed should take out a good amount of Lumbar rotation as well. So the  majority of it should be coming from your thoracic spine now, ideally you should be able to rotate to about 45 degrees each way what this means is that if you're looking or having a video of yourself from the top down that that PVC pipe or broomstick is going to align with the tape that is making the v in front of you. So that should let you know whether or not you are at least moving to 45 degrees of rotation each way. That's a minimum. Hopefully should be able to get that now while you're doing this I want you to look.  For can you at least hip a minimum? Yes. No, and you have big a cemeteries each way. So are you able to get to like 45 degrees when you rotate to the right? But when you go to the left you're able to go all the way to like 60 or 70 degrees obviously a big a cemetery in that can be an issue when we're talking about movements in the weight room that we require to be symmetrical. So for example, if you're a baseball player, it's pretty  Amon to develop these natural asymmetries aside aside differences and movement because baseball because of the throwing Motion in the hitting motion is not a very symmetrical sport. It's common to see these adaptations over time where you just move a little bit differently the same reason like a field goal kicker would maybe have a humongous hypertrophy muscular stance leg because they're planting their foot and then they're kicking leg is sort of scrawny looking in comparison because it's being used as a  Shot to kick the ball as far as possible weightlifting is very different weightlifting powerlifting and strongman things like that CrossFit. A lot of the movements were doing are very symmetrical in nature. We want them to be symmetrical when you're squatting a bar when you're benching when you're dead lifting when you are jerking or snatching you want the movement on the right and your left side of your body to be very symmetrical. So when we're doing screenings, especially for Mobility if we see these large differences side to side. It means that there may be an opportunity for those eight.  Asymmetrical problems to occur with your training which is then going to invite technique issues into the picture because your liftings never going to be as efficient as possible. So let's say you came up short you weren't able to get to 45 degrees each way or you had a big difference I decide what is your game plan for fixing? Well, there's a couple things you can do all this stuff. Also if you would like to get visuals of this and not only have pictures but videos go on my website squat University.com.  The blog article tab, you can scroll down in the first chunk. It is mobility all different blogs and Mobility but there's one specifically that is how to improve the rest explain extension in there. You will find six different ways that I found to be very efficient at improving limitations in thoracic spine extension. There's a mobilization that you're doing a joint mobilization with a peanut which is basically to lacrosse balls or tennis balls tape together. There's a stiff specific stretches. There's a foam roller.  Uh, there's a box thrust explain Mobility stretch. You can do rotations in a seated position and a deep squat with rotation position. All these are best left to getting a good visual for this so go on my website and check those out. I also have shared a number of these on the squat University Instagram site as well. Now regardless of which Mobility exercises you choose the big thing to understand is you always need to use this test retest method to see if the exercise you just chose and  Performed is placing you on the right track to improving the mid-back Mobility that we desire. So always do that 45 degree rotation and get on to the Barb. Oh, you know, so you actually eat some practical application to what as well try like in overhead squat where you may be limited then do the exercise and then retest and either those in see was it effective at improving your positions because in the end that's what we're going for. Now the big thing to understand though, is that the exercises that I just  Listed there. Not a magic pill for improving Mobility instantly. They will not fix stiffness in one session. But if you do notice a small change in movement quality after retesting and roasting, you should definitely consider adding these into your daily schedule until you at least have found that it as taking care of the issue, or maybe you just found that it is something you just need for your Mobility prep prior to doing overhead squats. For example, consistency is key.  For progressions in Mobility, especially in the thoracic spine of the body because it just has such propensity to adaptively tighten and stiff and because of your posture throughout the day. So again, another thing on top of that that I always tell my patients while I'm working with them at physical therapy is that you could do as many Mobility exercises as you want throughout the day, but if you do not also think about your postures that you are doing the other  23 hours throughout the day or at least the other 12 hours that you're awake. The adaption process for stiffness is always going to come back the mobility exercises. You choose are creating sort of this open window that you can then perform your exercises with a little bit better movement quality because that's obviously our goal, but then you need to then let that stick or set in by moving. Well the rest of the day so remember Mobility is not just something that we work on tell  Lot better it's something to help us move better the rest of our life. So that is it for today's podcast. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for listening to Today's Show. I hope you enjoyed and you're able to get something out of it for understanding that the Rasik spine a little bit better why it's so important to have sufficient Mobility there and how you can test for it in a few ways that you could go about fixing it. If you have a problem in that area also, it would mean the world to me for you guys to go and leave a rating in review on the podcast.  It's not hard click on your podcast. Click on the squat University link under the show and then scroll all the way to the bottom right there leave a rating and review that would mean a lot to me. It'll help me spread the show to others who need to hear it and help make the world a little bit better place overall. So again, thank you so much for checking out today show and until next time guys. Happy Squad. That's it for today class on squat University by dr.

Hello everyone. Welcome back to the Gen C girl podcast. My name is Abby Iceland and I am the host feels like it's been a hot minute since I've recorded. I didn't record anything last week because the last two episodes were like pre-recorded. So it's been a minute since I've sat in front of the mic but it feels really good to be back. It is currently the end of dead week and beginning of finals week for me. So this week I have one final a presentation and I have to take the GMAT which should be interesting. I'm very thankful. Only have one final though, like one real final wear hats like go in and sets it and take a test. But I am dreading the GMAT. So that's just a little bit of an update on what's going on in my life. I'm really excited for today's episode. This is one that has been requested a lot and I personally really really really enjoy listening to these episodes just because I feel like they provide a lot of insight into the things people really love. I'm going to be doing a master list kind of going through my favorite skincare makeup Hair Fitness and  and just all those kinds of different categories of products. I guess I was so focused on making sure I got like every little category covered and then I realized that I could literally go on forever and get super duper in detail, but then that would take like a very long time to talk about everything. So I'm trying to just do the essentials like of skincare makeup Hair Fitness like drinks like household accessories that kind of thing. So those are kind of the categories. I'm going to be covering and I will try and Link things down below or I'm just going to like me.  Make a big list of all the links some that you can like swipe up on or something on my Instagram. So definitely be sure to be following the jinns ego podcast on Instagram and that's always like down below. But before we get started, obviously you guys know that I love to start off with a quote that's relevant to the episode. So I really really really really really like this quote and I actually have not heard it before I don't think but it's very simple and this quote is by Jackie French Koehler and it says there are two ways to be rich  one is by acquiring much and the other is by Desiring little and I know this seems kind of backwards that I am kind of talking about a more minimalist approach type of quote whenever I'm about to talk about a ton of materialistic things. That's exactly why I'm using this quote because I want to remind you guys that you know, it's not life is not about like if you have the most expensive makeup and skincare and having like the best, you know clothes for the gym or the best pair of shoes or you know the best  Designer bag like it's literally life is so much more than things and I feel like nowadays on social media and on YouTube. There's so many people who are so obsessed with materialistic items and whenever they display all they have it can kind of make you feel inferior in a way. If you're not necessarily in a position where you can afford the same lifestyle and I find that that's really toxic. Just sometimes I'll like watch people and I feel like all I feel  Feel like I should be doing when I watch their content or listen to their content is spending money. And that's just a part of our consumerism and ridged like culture nowadays. I feel like with everything being digital and there's nothing wrong, you know with investing and good quality things and there's nothing wrong with you know, having makeup and skincare like I literally do not want to condemn anyone for having any of these things because it's totally normal to you know have makeup and have skin care and have nice clothes and invest in. Peace.  Are going to last a long time versus buying a ton of cheaply made poor for the environment type of things. But what I want to emphasize is that if you are in a place where you can't really like afford to live lavish Lifestyles that incorporate, you know, the best of the best and every single category of life. It's okay, you know, there is no pressure and there is no reason why you should feel like you should be, you know, spending more money than you're making. There's no reason that you should be, you know, spending so much money on doing things.  Things and buying things that you don't really need and I really liked this quote because you know, you can look at being rich in two different ways. You can look at it by how much you acquire like how many designer bags you have designer shoes fancy things, you know the best makeup or skincare or you can look at being rich by just looking at it as you don't desire as much because your life is so rich of other things and I really like that alternative the latter approach by just as re little that's the best way to make your life richer Maya.  And because life is not about materialistic things, but I just really really feel like there's so much pressure to like have all of these, you know fancy things that we don't really need and it can get really toxic to your mindset because you feel like just because you see other people have certain things or do certain things. You should be the same way and that's totally not the case. So I just wanted to emphasize that although this episode is all about products and things that I love it and no mean like in no way am I like telling you to go buy all these things?  Things it's just me sharing things that I've used for a while that I personally love and I think that these episodes are helpful for people who you know, maybe want to just hear about what someone else likes in order to see what they may like for themselves. And if they just want a little Direction and it's really just a light-hearted and fun episode and I wanted to do something that wouldn't take an extensive amount of mental planning because when I do my very deep episodes that get kind of emotional in a sense it takes a lot out of me mentally and I couldn't really afford to be like emotionally and mentally exhausted.  During finals week. So that's why I'm doing this one. That's a little bit more just like harder to materialistic. So now my goal for the week. My goal is to not sweat the small stuff A lot of times when big things are going on like finals or midterms or I'm taking a you know, graduate admission test and it's just really stressful and it's really easy to Hype up all of these things that and the long run like really only have you know a  Mahler impact, I feel like it's really easy to overhype, you know finals and just think that it's absolute into the world if you get a c on one and you know life goes on and a lot of times I know like whenever I was taking the act in high school and I feel the same way right now with the GMAT. I feel like my life is revolving around it and I'm putting so much of my energy into you know, this test that really I mean it is important. I don't want to say like don't care about things but I want to say like don't make them.  More stressful than they need to be and that's my goal for this week is to not you know, I feel like if I go into the GMAT stressing too much or I go into my final stressing too much. It makes me do worse because my stress overwhelms my mental capacity to like do well and that's horrible. So that's my goal for this week in my gratitude for this week is that I only have one final during this time of having them take the GMAT, you know, my boyfriend has three I have friends that have like three to five finals and I just literally don't know what I would do if I had that while taking the GMAT.  Matt so I'm just that's a very simple gratitude thing, but I am very very thankful that I only have one and then to go on a deeper level. I hope Katie's listening to this because this is her last week of college here ever before she goes abroad and I don't know when I'll see her again after this week and I'm just really going to mess her and I'm just really grateful to have had a friend like her through college and really thankful to have met her and thankful to spend time with her this week and everything. So I'm super grateful for that if you can hear my dog.  I'm sorry. I'm used to she was gone like the entire month of October with my parents because I was traveling so much and she is literally barking so much. So it's just like if you can hear that in the background, hopefully it will stop but I'm going to go ahead and get into the master list. I'm going to start off with skincare and something that I never used to use that I started using probably about halfway through this year is scar gel. And I really really think it's great if you ever have like really badly.  Like cystic acne or just a flare up and you pick at it and it leaves a really bad scars something. I think it's really great to have a scar gel to kind of help your skin recover and I really personally love the Derma e scar gel. I think it's around twenty eight dollars, but also puts it that whole brand twenty to thirty percent off all the time. I bought mine for 30 or 40% off I think and it does a really good job of helping your skin recover quicker from acne scars and I feel like even when I just get some redness or you know,  A pimple or something. I feel like it helps so much with like the appearance of the pimples go down. I don't know and as far as serums go, so I love serums so much just because I really have dry skin. So they help a lot. My favorite is the Sephora vitamin C glow serum and it's just the Sephora brand and honestly, that's my absolute favorite. I tried the only Hendrickson truth serum and I liked it a lot but I feel like it balls up on my face if you know what I mean like after I rub it in and  After it sets if I kind of like rub my face, which I probably shouldn't be doing it kind of like the product balls up and comes off and I don't really like that and then to oils that I really like that I got recently are the ordinary rosehip seed oil and the ordinary marula oil. The ordinary is a great skincare brand. I know it's highly recommended by dermatologists and it's extremely affordable. You can find it at Ulta or online and their products are just like really pure and I really like both of those oils a lot for my dry skin. So as far as eye creams  And I things I guess you could say my favorite eye cream is the only Henriksen banana bright eye cream. It's just really moisturizing and I feel like it just kind of makes my eyes a little bit more lifted. I really bad hereditary dark circles, and I'm sure you guys know that if you watch my YouTube videos and listen to me say it all the time. They've always been an insecurity of mine just how puffy my eyes can get sometimes and how tired I can look and I discovered the ordinary caffeine solution and putting a little bit of that serum on  On top of my eyes and under my eyes everyday definitely helps with the puffiness. It doesn't completely eliminate it but I find on my eyes get so much less puffy. Whatever I wear that so as far as moisturizer goes, I'm I have a couple that I like a lot but for a while I was only using like the Sephora brand skincare that they came out with this past April is the literally so good and like I know skin care is different for everyone makeups different for everyone, but for me personally and my skin type using the Sephora vitamin C glow serum and the  Our moisturizer. I think it's called the all day moisturizer and it's a little in a little tub using those two together. My skin did not break out for like months. Like I only got like little baby sweat pimples or something that would go away in a day and I absolutely love this for all day moisturizer and their products are really affordable to which is great some other Alternatives that I like. I really like the only Hendrickson see Rush cream. I think that's what it's called. It comes kind of you can get like a little travel-size kit has the banana bright eye cream the  With serum and the see Rush cream in it, and that's what I got to try their products out. But in my opinion you can get so much more products for so much cheaper from the Sephora brand and it's like all really similar products and I really really liked those two for one's a lot and then the last moisturizer I'm going to mention is the bareMinerals butter drench moisturizer. This one is incredible and honestly, it's probably my preferred one. The only reason I don't get it. It's because it's not a lot of product and it's like thirty dollars as opposed to the Sephora one being under $20 and being the same amount of product.  For face wash honestly, what I've been using is the Kate Somerville goat milk cleanser. I got it in a fabfitfun box literally a year ago. So it's honestly probably expired but I feel like it cleans my face so well and I love how it feels it's very moisturizing and I hate cleansers that kind of like make your face feel just dryer in a sense. And as far as like acne washes goes, I've always loved the Neutrogena green at me wash like the kind of it's not  I don't know the consistency. I don't know how to explain it but it's just a green Neutrogena acne wash and with Southside salicylic acid. I haven't used it in a while but I was using that like the past like eight years of my life. I swear and I really want to try the glossy a face wash. I don't know what it's called. Like the jelly milk cleanser something. I've heard really good things about it, but have yet to purchase it just because I don't want to take the plunge until I'm out of my Kate Somerville one. I would honestly Never by the Kate Somerville one because I think it's like $70, but since I got in the fabfitfun  Box, I'm just using it. So as far as exfoliators go by far the best exfoliator I've ever gotten is the Derma e microdermabrasion scrub. I mentioned this in a favorites video on YouTube and literally it makes your face feel like you just got a facial. I've had a facial once in my life and I remember how my skin felt after it. It felt like I just had like like my pores were completely clean and I felt like my face was just so smooth and had no texture and if you use that like two or three times a week from Germany, it literally makes such a difference.  Difference in your skin and I feel like it really does a good job of removing the dead skin cells and I feel like you have to use it as instructed for it's like really work. Well because I find that when I don't rub it in and scrub it in for the time it says to it doesn't do as well of a job, but I seriously love it so much and it's pretty affordable as well for lips. I love the Laneige let mask just like every other influencer and podcaster and YouTuber, whatever you want to call it out there. However, just a little life pack. Could you not buy  Sephora Amazon has the nozzle at mass for literally like $12 and they last forever in the little pot. I also have the Menage lip balm that comes in the little squeezy tubes and I have it in the pair scent and it's really good. And I also really like the just the Aquaphor lip balm. That's just as good and it's really cheap and so is the Mario badescu lutwama those are like my three favorites and Joseline's obviously a great affordable option as well for toner. I have a benefit hydrating toner and  And this is really good if you're someone who wants to use toner before you put on makeup and like prep your skin, but you want it to be hydrating. It's a very cooling gel kind of consistency, but a little bit more runny cooling toner, and it makes my face feel so hydrated and I love putting that on before I wear lotion on my face and I really need to get some more of it because I ran out and just haven't repurchased and it's actually amazing and then a regular kind of toner that like exfoliates and kind of remove skin texture is the  Daenerys glycolic acid seven percent solution toner. I think it's under like ten dollars and it's a big bottle and I can feel it like working because whenever I go over a spot that just has like large pores or I'm breaking out. I can feel it burn a little bit which I know sounds bad but it's like I feel like it's a good thing and I just really like using that once a day at night after I get all the shower and it's that's how it's constructed that use. So I just kind of follow the instructions on that for makeup remover. My favorite wipes are these  Full makeup wipes the micellar water ones. And then I also like to use micellar water by simple like the actual micellar water on my face on a cotton pad after I use any makeup wipes, but I'm trying to stray away from the use of makeup wipes because I know it's not very good to like tug at your skin and stuff. So I try to like eliminate the makeup wipes, especially for the environment as well because I know it's obviously there's better Solutions but something that I like a lot. I'm just trying to run through all of my makeup wipes, right?  Because I have a ton because my grandma always buys me like the same size box with the Neutrogena ones and I like them they do a good job at the same time. They make my face really oily after and I hate that in the simple makeup wipes don't do that. But in the shower is I'm taking a shower as I the end of the day like I have makeup on I'll just use my Clinique take the day off bomb and basically it's just like this bomb stuff that you rub it between your fingers and rub all over your face and it just makes your makeup dissolve and I really like using that  It's tough in the shower. I hate using it in my sink though because it always makes such a big mess. And for lotion. This is just kind of like body lotion. I guess that's really the skin care. I love the any humps lotion is so good. I hate lotions that take forever to rub into your skin and like your skin doesn't really soak them up very quickly and you have to sit there and like rub it in for forever. I find that so annoying and I really like the him solution because it doesn't do that, but I never buy at full price from old.  Or Target, I always get it at T.J.Maxx or Marshals for like $12. I also recently got the soap & Glory magnifico drop in the lotion lotion and its really really good. It's very similar to hips in the scent that sense. It's very lightweight and rubs them very well and then Brazilian bum bum cream, I freaking love this stuff, but it's expensive as all get out. I'm asking for more for Christmas because I don't want to buy it myself and it just smells so tropical and like the beach and so does the soap & Glory one?  But I love the bum cream and it's supposed to be tightening but I've never used it consistently enough to notice results or at least pay attention to them. And as far as shower gel goes by far the Brazilian for play moisturizing shower gel from the same brand. I think it's sold de Janeiro that makes it as a bum bum cream. It's so good. You know whenever you use a body wash in the shower and I'm like literally makes your skin feel weird to wear like whenever you run your hand like down your arm or something. It kind of gets stuck.  Look from like the soap scum or something. I hate that so much and it makes your skin feel really dry and tight. But this foreplay moisturizing shower gel by Sol de Janeiro smells incredible and does not do that to your skin. And I absolutely love it. And I want some more of that too. But a good alternative that I like a lot is the target their method brand they have these different body washes and all the different scents. I've tried like two different ones and they are so amazing. I think the one right I have right now is like an orchid scent.  But I've had the peony one before and that one smells amazing. So now going into makeup. Let's kind of everything for skin care. I'm going to kind of just like go through an order of like sort of no, it's not in order of how I put on my makeup. I don't know what I'm saying. So my favorite primers that I've come across I have always been reluctant to buy primers because I feel like I used to think they were kind of fraudulent and since like I felt like they didn't do anything and I was just like wasting money, but I know that's not true because I do know that they do help the longevity of your makeup and  One high and one that I really like a lot is benefit porefessional. I feel like it smooth my face out so much because I have large pores like kind of on my cheeks by my nose and I feel like it completely like erases them and the Maybelline Baby skin is a cheaper alternative to this but it's more silicone-based than the benefit porefessional which I don't love but the Maybelline Baby skin is more budget friendly and it does the same thing and those are the only two I've ever really used in my life to be honest and I always put those on first after my skincare  And after my primer, I freaking love glowing makeup like Matt is not for me like with dry skin. I just can't do it. My favorite primer. My favorite glowy base to hit like things to put on my face to have it will be base. I got these Becca luminous drops and oh my gosh you guys, I don't know what shade I have but it literally makes me look like the Tin Man whenever I put them on and it looks really scary at first, but then once I put my foundation on top of it, it's beautiful and every time I've worn those drops  Underneath my Foundation or mix them in with my Foundation. I've gotten compliments on how healthy and glowy and how nice my makeup and skin looks so I really freaking love those and they come in like a little serum dropper bottle. And I also really like mac strobe cream, but ever since I discovered that luminous drops, I really have not use my Mac strobe cream like at all as far as like light foundations tinted moisturizers and BB creams go glossy a skin tint is great when I'm not breaking out and I just like wake up in the morning and I'm trying to run out the door to  gasps but my skin looks really dull and tired and I just want something to kind of even out the skin tone. I'll just throw on the glossiest content. But if you need any coverage at all, do not waste your money on this content because it provides basically none if you want more coverage than the skin temp, but you don't really want the level of Like It Cosmetics CC cream Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer is so good. I love that and I use that whenever I just don't feel like doing a full face of makeup and you know having a heavy foundation on and I want more coverage than the glossy Ace content.  For foundation my all-time favorites. I have a few just because I do switch out my foundations a lot. I love the Nars natural radiant long where I really hate how all of their shades are more yellowy based though because I feel like I can never get a true match because I feel like I have a pretty neutral undertone. But that Foundation is incredible. I always get compliments when I wear that on my skin to and the Smashbox 48 48 Hour Photo Finish is really well are really great. I love the shade range that Smashbox cap Smashbox.  As and I feel like it does a really good job of like having such a wide shade range to where you can like actually find your true match and that one like where's very long and it's very buildable. The IT Cosmetics CC cream is like a Holy Grail. I love it. But I hate their shade range because I feel like the one that's between fair and light is too light for me, but then light is too dark for me, which is really weird because normally I'm more in between light and medium but that's easy cream is so incredible just because it has SPF in it has really great coverage and it  You really can't feel it on your face all day to faced Born This Way is a really great natural buildable Foundation. That's kind of in the halfway glowy halfway mat side and I feel like it's a very natural-looking Foundation. I used to wear that all the time in high school and early college and for concealer my favorite concealers just for everyday. Like if I just need like a quick touch-up, but not don't need a lot of coverage and I just kind of want to brighten an area I use the glossy a stretch concealer. It pairs so nicely with a glossy a skin to him.  The two worked together very very well. But I really like that concealer. If I'm just like concealing my veins on top of my eyelids or if I'm just concealing my under eye circles heart-shaped tape is by far the best for any blemishes. I feel like you can cover anything up with that stuff and the best like concealer that I use anytime. I really wear makeup if I don't have blemishes and I'm just putting it kind of in my T-Zone to brighten the area or under my eyes as the colour-pop no filter concealer. It's very similar to tart shape tape, but not as thick.  Thick and it Blends out really nicely. And I also think that the shade I have is so perfect for like my under eyes and my skin tone for powder. I have a couple here too because I can't just pick one The Bare Minerals mineral Veil finishing powder. It's like an Illuminating finishing power kind of powder kind of and it is so great because I feel like I can't really feel it on my face and I got a deluxe size of it around Christmas last year. They always come out with like deluxe sizes of it around.  This time and might have like a little star charm bracelet around it. And I really really love that powder just for setting my whole face hourglass. Ambient lighting powder in dim light is so incredible. I had it for like two years and I finally hit pan on it. But what I used to do is set kind of like my neck my eyes in my cheese them with my bare minerals powder and then I would put The Hourglass ambient light powder all over the rest of my face and it's seriously just gives this nice.  Anglo kind of look like your skin just naturally goes that way to all your makeup and I really want to repurchase it but instead I tried out the Clinique uplighting Illuminating powder recently and I really really love that powder because it does the same exact thing is our last one. However, I feel like it doesn't really set your face and it's just kind of like putting a highlight on your face sort of but it's not like it doesn't look like a highlight if that makes sense, but I feel like the Clinique one doesn't set the makeup really like The Hourglass one does but neither one of them are meant to be setting powders. They're just kind of  And powders for bronzer by far number one winner is the Physicians Formula butter bronzer. It smells amazing. It looks amazing. I feel like they have I think they have a couple different shades which is good and really bronzers only have a few Shades anyways across Brands, but I have been online for like two years now, and I'm just now hitting pan which is crazy. But I also don't wear makeup everyday and I freaking love this bronzer. I pick it over the hoola benefit bronzer. I pick it.  Over my tart bronzers that I've had. It's so good and it Blends so nicely and it's literally like buttery smooth for blush. I've been using the Burt's Bees Peach shade, very affordable extremely pigmented. I have to like a really top the brush every time I use it because I just like don't look like a clown when I put on my blush. They only have a few Shades, but at the peach ones like Supernatural and gives a really nice natural flush and then the benefit rocket or is like a really pretty pinky peachy color that has a little bit of Shimmer in it, and I loved that Bloody.  I haven't used it in ages for highlighter highlighters, like my favorite thing about makeup. I feel like I always just like throw a bunch on but it makes the biggest difference and makeup. I love the ofra highlighters like their formula they blend out so well, they're not like chunky and glittery. They're just very smooth. I have the shades Star Island, but I've heard Rodeo Drive is really good. But more of like a gold shade than the Star Island one is and Star Island. I always put you know, wherever you put highlighter.  Lighter on the high points of my face and I always put it on my inner Corner tube of my eyes and it makes them pop so much I freaking love that highlighter. It was worth every penny and for like cream highlighters. The glossy a Halo scope is incredible. I absolutely like I pretty much almost wear it every day unless I'm like just sitting in the house just because I feel like it adds so much life to my skin without having to put on any other makeup for brows. My favorite brow pencil is the benefit precisely my brow pencil. I feel like that  Nostalgia ones run out really fast and I feel like the benefit wants last longer but that could just be me. I recently got the Urban Decay brow blade and one side is like a felt-tip marker type of thing for your brows and the other side is a pencil and I ran out of the pencil but I still have the felt tip and the felt tip if you can like Master how to hold it and apply it. It looks really really good after you split your brows out after using it and I really really like it for brow gels glossy a boy brows incredible for filling in sparse.  He has really quickly and setting your brows in place, but colour-pop has a really good dupe that's cheaper than the glossy boy brow. And it's just the colour-pop brow. Gel. It's really good for setting spray. I used to be a Urban Decay all nighter girl. And now I freaking love the morphe continuous Mist setting spray. It is so good. I seriously feel like I can feel all of my makeup just sink into my skin whenever I put it on and it's like if I forget to put on setting spray, I  Notice like 10 minutes after I saw the pain my makeup because my face feels so much more cakey if I don't set it because I feel like the setting spray if it's the right kind really just helps the makeup all sink into like one layer onto your face. I also really like an affordable version of setting spray, which the more she was only like $16, I think in a lasso while and the sprayer on it is so good because it doesn't like soak your face. It's just a really fine Mist but the wet and wild coconut scented prep and Prime spray is to die for and I think it's  under five dollars and it does such a good job of you know, prepping your face for makeup. I do use it to set my face sometimes and I do feel like it's not as effective in making my makeup lasts as long as the more if you wanted to us, but it does still help and it just smells absolutely incredible and I always take that one with me when I travel because it's a lot smaller of a bottle than the morphe one for eyeshadow. Oh my gosh. I used to be such an eyeshadow palette hoarder and I still have a lot and I only use like the same to all the time.  But my favorite that I've ever had is probably the Anastasia Modern Renaissance. It is so beautiful and like I love the colors in it. I feel like they look really good on my skin tone and all my eyes and the shades are extremely pigmented. So you don't you have to use a lot of product and like sit there and dig your brush into the eyeshadows. I really want to try this off Glam palette. I think it's so beautiful, but I can't get myself to spend more money on eyeshadow palettes when I literally wear eyeshadow like two or three times a month if that a really great cheaper alternative, which I'm trying to give like to  Alternatives for most products just because I know a lot of us are on budgets and don't really want to spend a lot of money on makeup color pop eyeshadow palettes are super underrated. I feel like because are really really pigmented. And so our tart like if you can get your hands on like a mini size tar eyeshadow palette, they're always so good, but I have the colour-pop palette. I don't know the exact name of it. I want to say it's called. Yes, please and it's like all these really warm pinky Peach orange Shades and like some very sparkly ones.  And I love that palette so much and I love the eyeshadows in it and you get a ton of eyeshadow for like under $20 and I love it. We're going to go ahead and move into hair so I could so many questions about my hair all the time. I have naturally very curly hair and my hair short. I'm sure a lot of you guys know that my favorite shampoo. I used to use Redken and red can only and I would just buy the leader size bottles whenever they would have their big like hairstyles, which I think they do around Christmas and sometimes  In the summer, so they only do it twice a year and I loved red can all soft and Redken fridge dismiss and I still do but I feel like using my hair stylist or I don't know why I'm saying stylist. I guess she is my stylist. But the lady who cuts my hair I get my hair done it and Ulta salon at home and she told me like that like the build-up from cheaper shampoo Brands is so bad on your hair like she I was using I don't remember what brand I was using before.  Or I started using Redken, but she whenever she would do my hair she would like she had this comb and she would comb my hair out before she washed it and she would show me all of the product build-up from the shampoo and conditioner. I was using and it was disgusting. She was like, I can't believe you have this much build up in your hair and I started using rag can and like I never had any of that buildup anymore and that's what like she recommended and that's what the salon uses and it really does make a big difference and like how your hair looks and feels  Recently, I discovered the Pacifica pineapple curls shampoo and conditioner and oh my gosh. I'm so obsessed with it. It smells just like pineapples. It smells so tropical and good and it makes my hair so freaking soft. And as far as helping my curls goes, I do think that it helps a lot with just kind of like maintaining the frizz and like just the softness of my hair and I really like it a lot and I love that their formulas are like sulfate free paraben free and they're vegan. So I feel like they're pretty  probably I'm gonna ask my hairstyle is when I got my hair done again. It's like the Pacifica ones cause any build-up and I really don't think it has so for conditioner. I really don't use conditioner that often like maybe once every like two weeks just because it makes my hair oily if I use it all the time, but I really like the Pacifica one goes with a shampoo and I normally just try to get a matching conditioner with my shampoo as far as like styling my hair after the shower goes. I've tried a bajillion different products and I've yet to find like a Holy Grail.  Um products that kind of just like makes my hair like great all the time, which you can't really have hair. That's great all the time when you have curly hair because it's really unpredictable and it looks different every day. I would say my best that I've come across honestly. This is shocking because it's only three or four dollars. I think at the store the Herbal Essences totally Twisted curl boosting moose does a incredible job of defining curls without making them crunchy and without being really heavy and way down keeping volume. I really love  Of that stuff a lot. I've tried out Diva Curl David Curl, whatever you want to say and the only product that works in my hair. Well is the light styling gel. They have it in a small travel size bottle if you want to try it out and that stuff works really well, but I do feel like my hair gets kind of oily with it quicker and sometimes do girl products cause a lot of product buildup in my hair, which I do not like for hairspray. I only use hairspray whenever I style my hair like curl it with an actual curler and  They like the no frizz waitlist living proof hairspray. I don't really think it's necessarily like a holding hairspray, but it does a really good job of like spraying your hair and not making it crunchy and keeping the frizz down which is like what I have mainly the most issues with I don't use a straightener like ever if I do it's one of my friends or my mom. So I like never straighten my hair. But if I ever curl my hair, I have a Hot Tools curling bear like not one but a curling iron and it's a one and a quarter inch barrel. It's purple.  And like gold and green and it's like very extra and out there but I got it on sale last Christmas and I love it. But it's the long hair version because they seven really long hair. So I needed an extra long barrel to wrap my hair around by I don't have that anymore. So I don't really need it. But I freaking have loved this curler so much. I feel like the one and a quarter inch barrel is perfect for making like the soft waves, but the key to curl in your hair, it sounds crazy and it's so hard to do after you spent so much time curling your hair, but whenever you curl your hair.  Our hair spray after you curl it and then take a comb your fingers or a brush through your curls. And I know it's like so scared to do that after you just spent so much time on your hair but went to do that and then kind of like use your fingers to reshape the curls. It gives that look that you always see everywhere online nowadays and on Instagram of like the soft beachy waves and it's just makes a world of a difference than just curling your hair and hair spraying it and calling it a day. Okay now we're going to go into jewelry wear out of  All of the skincare and makeup and all that kind of stuff. I don't wear a lot of jewelry. I wear my Apple watch every day. I wear this necklace every day. It's super dainty. It's got a very tiny tiny gold chain and then it's a tiny little gold circle with a g on it, which is my boyfriend's initial. I wear it every single day. It was literally $35 and I've had it for a year and a half now and it is incredible like I shower with it. I've been in salt water with it. I've been in pools with it and it is still pretty gold like it.  Not tarnish at all. It's a little bit more dull but I will literally do not take it off like a probably taking it off twice in the past year and a half and I shower with it and everything and it has kept its I mean golden is like it hasn't turned green at hasn't turned silver and I really really love it. I can't believe it was only $35 and the website is just GLD n.com. I've gotten so many people to buy their jewelry because it's just incredible quality and you can get like legitimate gold pieces from there. I think but mine's just like a 14  That gold filled which I don't really know what the difference is. But I really love it. As far as earrings go every day. I have my 1st and 2nd hole appears and every day. I just wear dainty hoops and both of my holes, but in my second holes, I have these hoops from the jury, which is just mej URI and I love them so much. I got him for Christmas last year, but it's really weird because they only sell the ones I have and like single Hoops. So I sent the link to my mom like for my Christmas.  List and it was like $32 I think and I thought it was for a pair and it was just a single Hoops when I opened it on Christmas. It was just one hoop and I was like Mom I think they forgot the send one like somehow and she was so mad and so upset. They like it messed up my Christmas present and I was like, it's fine. It's not the end of the world and I contacted them and they're like, oh that's actually the only hope we have that we sell individually but major he's like really expensive to get like a pair of Hoops. And for some reason those single Hoops there like $30 each, but it's still way cheaper than buying.  Hang a pair of Hoops from them and they're really really small like little Hoops like their little Huggies, but just like my necklace. I've worn these I do not literally never take my second hole earrings out unless I'm wearing look really nice earrings and it just doesn't match them or something which could barely ever happens and they have not like tarnished all because they're like not real pure gold. But you know what? I mean, they're just not going to tarnish because they're a lot nicer and quality and then my first whole I got this pack from Target that just had three different sizes.  Is of many Hoops, but they were all on the smaller end and they're great but I don't really ever take them out and they just kind of eventually turned silver. So I need to like buy another pair of the majority wants to put my first hole. So they never tarnish as far as like Rings go and things like that. I have one that I always wear all my left ring finger, which I know makes me looking like engaged or married or something. But only reason I wear it on my left hand as because only fits my ring finger, it doesn't fit like my middle.  Anger at all and I hate having rings on on my writing hand like for college and stuff like having to take notes with a ring on is literally horrible. So wear it on my left ring finger and it's just like a David Yurman ring that my boyfriend got me last year for our one year anniversary. I believe or it was for Christmas. I don't really remember which one it was, but I really really love it. And if I didn't have this ring I would wear one from Golden or imagery because once again they have mainly  And it's more affordable majorities don't really got affordable. But I feel like I would just buy like one nicer ring that wouldn't tarnished because I don't think it's worth buying cheaper jewelry all the time and having to constantly like get rid of jewelry. It makes a lot more sense to just kind of invest in like one nicer one that you can wear all the time. Like my I've definitely gotten my where's worth out of you know, my ring and my earrings and my necklace and they're really not even still that expensive as far as accessories go. I didn't have a lot.  For jewelry because I just don't really wear a lot of jewelry, honestly, but for accessories my favorite purse that I've owned lately. I've never been much of a person surprisingly. But lately I've been getting so annoyed like whenever I'm going somewhere and I'm like carrying my phone and my keys and my are pods my wallet and like all this different stuff. It's obviously really hard to carry all of that. I have a Rebecca Minkoff Mini Mac crossbody bag. I love it so much. It's white and it has like this gunmetal colored chain, and it's so pretty and sleek and I love  And I got it on sale for like 80 dollars during their semi annual sale during the summer. So if you can ever get one on sale, that would be great. And they have a bigger version of my bag, which I wish I had the bigger version now honestly, but I have the many one and it's still a good size and I love it so much. I have never had a taste for designer items and I think it's just because I grew up not really like being able to afford them which is totally fine. So I've never really looked at designer items and I don't know.  No, maybe one day I'll get one but I just still am not at a point where I feel like it makes sense for me to spend that much money on like purses or wallets or anything like that really spending like my own money for me. Like I would probably get someone something like that because I love giving and everything but as far as like spending it on myself, it's really hard for me to do and I have not owned anything like designer like that in my life. So I just really like good quality purses that just don't break the bank like Rebecca Minkoff is  Like great band, Marc. Jacobs is a great brand and you can find their stuff at places like Nordstrom Rack and Marshalls, which is really great because then you can get like an even better deal on it. As far as reusable water bottles goes. I am one of those gals that loves her Hydra flask. I have the 40 ounce and the lilac color and I absolutely love it because I can drink to and have like well over my required daily limit or would have not required that my not let it I don't know what I just said that but my like suggested intake of water I guess.  And I just really like hydrofloss but you can find Dukes for them at Marshall's and TJ Maxx. So if you don't want to spend the money on a Hydro Flask and you don't ask for one for Christmas highly recommend going into Marshals or TJ Maxx and looking because they have some bottles that literally look the exact same like same colors and everything at Marshall's and TJ Maxx. I have this little key wallet on my keys that just holds on my cards and like my ID and everything and it's kind of like that little Dalmatians body print that's really popular right now and it's like a fake fur kind of look but it's  I'm really really warm down. It's from Brandy Melville and I got it for like $8.00 and I think they have it on their website, but they only have it in tan and black and Minds like a white and black and I got mine from a Brandy Melville store in Houston. So if you have a Brandy Melville store and you really like the way that sounds or if you've seen it before on a video of mine definitely check their target has a really really great key wallets. I know most people have like the Louis Vuitton key wallet or a Gucci one or something like that. But once again, I just can't get myself to  Spend that much money on a little key wallet. Like I just can't so the $8 Brandy Melville one is much more my price range, but at the same time it's gotten so worn down so fast, like I'm already looking to buy a new one and I've only had it for like six months. So that's probably the good thing about getting a more expensive one, but how to Rebecca Minkoff one that was black and it was just plain black and it just had a little like envelope style button opening and I got that for like forty dollars from  Socks off Fifth Avenue, like not the actual sex for but like the cheaper socks or whatever that has a discounted stuff and it lasted me a while and I think I gave it to my mom but it was in really great condition when I stopped using it. I just got tired of it and if you check like Target Nordstrom Rack Marshalls, T.J.Maxx sex all V all those places. They always have like Marc Jacobs like all those like nicer Brands like I was talking about Rebecca Minkoff and Marc Jacobs. I don't really break the bank and you can get Q Waltz from there for a really good price.  As far as my gym bag goes I have this little mini fabletics about pack and it's like a material that can get wet and it's just plain black as to little cup holders on the side and like one big main pocket and it's the perfect size gym bag. Like I don't need like this big duffle bag this point in my life for the gym because I can like always go home and change after the gym and stuff. I'm sure like once I start working. I'm going to need a bigger gym bag, but for right now, I love my fabletics backpack. And this is I'm gonna like kind of go through like little Tech things in here, too.  Yes for accessories because I feel like they are accessories for working out and being on the go. I love my ear pods. I'm one of those people I just think that they are the easiest to pop in and pop out. They are very comfortable. There's no wire that like gets really annoying because I used to have the Bluetooth beats that I think they're like just the mini studio beats or something that just kind of like go they wrap around your ear. So they're a little bit more uncomfortable and there's like a little wire that goes around your neck.  Neck in order always get caught in my hair and those are really great quality and if you don't want to spend as much on headphones, but you still went Bluetooth ones. I would recommend those but you might as well just spend that extra $50 for the air pods and not have the cord or the little ear things bothering you and then I have these studio beats. I think it's the most recent kind but whenever I bought my Mac desktop this year at the beginning of the school year, they always do the promos of beginning of the year that allow you to get like have Beats headphones for free whenever  You buy something off of Apple. So I got like these really nice likes and peachy kind of cut. They're not Peach. It's like a very light peach Standish color and then it's gold outline like where the beats are and they're so great for studying because I have a noise cancelling feature and already like even with all the noise canceling. They do a really great job of just like blocking out noise and I really like those for studying my backpack that I use for school is a North Face gesture and it's from Dick's and it's like a Dick's Sporting Goods.  Exclusive color and it's a off-white with like this Rose goldish Peach kind of color stitching and it's like I don't know not accessories but little accents and I really really like the gesture about pack. I used to have a Borealis I think and the gestures really really great. I think that has so much room and I can fit like everything I need and I can fit my laptop. My notebooks. My pencil pouches. My little Cosmetics pouch my camera and my I don't even know if I said,  I booked my iPad already but those things that my Chargers and even more and has really big side pockets for my giant hydroflax. Oh, I love that as far as Apple watch goes I do have an Apple Watch and I freaking love mine so much. It's the 42 millimeters Series 3 with no cellular. I get questions about that all the time and I really really love mine especially for working out on my gosh. It's like a game changer and I just have this little like metal-looking chain not really chain, but it's like a little metal.  Athletic band that I got us Amazon and I love it. So I do use blue light glasses and my favorite pair. I think I only have one pair but I used to have a pair from I've I to direct and they broke like I literally like remember breaking them and chipotle when I was a freshman here at Alabama and my favorite ones now are from glasses USA and I got them through a sponsorship with glasses USA around October November of last year and the Muse style mu SE  And I just have the black ones and I feel like they do such a good job of like just canceling out the blue light and I my eyes are so much less strained whenever I remember to wear them and I love them so much as far as planners go. Okay, you guys I'm a huge planner. I'm a huge to-do list maker. I'm very type A in that sense. And one of my favorite times of year is like whenever the years wrapping up and it's time for me to buy a new planner, but honestly, I don't think I'm going to buy another planner. Mine is pretty much done after this month.  Month and I bought a day designer and Target collaboration data is on her planner from Target obviously and I only use it for like the first month of school and I've just been digital on Google Calendars since then, so I'm going to say for planning and cat-like using a calendar. My master list item is Google Calendar, but if you are a pen and paper person still I highly recommend a designers or if you want to like spend a little bit of money. I think you can get a day designer for around 40 to 60 dollars online or if you want a very  Much more cheaper version of a day designer for a much more affordable price point and the same kind of styled a designer and Target have a collaboration and you can literally get all of them for under like 20 $25 and they're really great for sunglasses. I used to wear Ray-Bans in high school and I would get like a polarized ones that were really nice and expensive because I worked at a surf shop and we sold them there and I would always use my paycheck money and like get a pair of every summer but I am really bad at taking care of my sunglasses. I always put them in the pockets of my  Packed with a keys and I'll get scratched up or I'll forget where my cases and I won't put them up. So I found that just not spending a ton of money on sunglasses is better because it really easy to use or lose not use and I just don't take the best care of them. So I really like the key brand the Q UA why it looks like way but it's pronounced key. My favorite styles are the high Keys The heike Minis and then the Vivian the IV ien any Styles and I love those.  Super reflective ones where like people can't see into your eyes, but you can see out they're really really cute and they're definitely like more fashion style sunglasses. They don't do a lot but I do so help so now I'm going to go through clothing. I'm not really like going through everything but I'm trying to just like touch base with like things that I wear a lot personally. So as far as jeans go I used to be a big Urban Outfitters bdg girlfriend high rise jeans girl, and that's like the specific style name and I still love those.  But they're just not really stretchy like they're actually a denim material. So if you want like a real denim material, I think they're great jeans, but I recently discovered expressed genes and oh my gosh there denim is to die for I have this pair and they're like fleece jeans is what they're called and they're not like fleece-lined or anything crazy like that. But the material is kind of like is softest fleece in a sense, but it doesn't look like it. It's really insane and really weird but they're extremely flattering. They're kind of like a light medium wash and I love the color of them.  And it's just the express Highway syphilis jeans. If you look them up you should be able to find them and I also recently got the American Eagle curvy high rise jeans. I'm a huge fan. They're so great. If you're someone with like a bigger hip and butt area and a smaller waist area. That's kind of how I built. I just like carry a lot of my weight in my hips and in my upper thighs and it can be annoying whenever you're wearing jeans and you know, it fits all of your legs and then you're like waste doesn't fill out the hip and waist area of it or not the hip area but the waste of energy  You know what? I mean? Like whenever you are standing there, you can like stick both of your hands like through the pants still on your back because they're way too big and the waist. I like hate that so much and I love the curvy high rise jeans because I really like help fix that problem for curvier girls and I wear a size 4 and both of those genes actually got four shorts. I'm very thankful that Express an American Eagle both have the shore option of jeans because I don't have a long and slugs in the world and I'm only like 5 foot 5, which I know is not like super shorts a very  Average height but my legs aren't very long. Like I feel like a lot more of my height comes from my torso and regular size jeans are always too long on me. And I also really like my jeans to hit right above my ankle. Like I don't like them covering up my ankles. So those are my two favorite kinds of genes that I've been loving the most recently as far as the leggings go a lines from Lululemon are so incredible. I like getting the 25 inch once again because there's a shorter and hit right above my ankle. However, I only wear those if I'm just like literally going to class or  Y'all be like literally cannot be worn for working out or anything crazy because they will fall apart a really good alternative to those are the are replay leggings. I don't know if any of y'all have ever tried those but they're a lot cheaper and they're really really good. I don't have a pair of but I've tried them on and store before and I just didn't need another pair of leggings out the time so I didn't get them but they are very very comfortable and really similar to the aligns and you can also get similar feeling leggings from TJ Maxx and Marshalls by the 90 degree.  Three reflex brand and they feel a lot like a line. So definitely look for that brand and TJ Maxx and Marshalls, and then the one other pair of leggings that I'm going to mention our Lululemon Wonder under Lux dream leggings. I really really love the Wonder under lock stream like fabric. I feel like these leggings are built to last forever. The material is a lot more durable than a lines and you can work out and do pretty much anything in Wonder leggings. If you get the luck stream Fabric, and I personally just really really like them as far as like shorts go running shorts off.  Like shorts because that's just something I wear. I have a lot of I have like two pairs of lemon lemon shorts that I freaking love but Lulu Lemon is a notorious for starting and discontinuing Styles, especially and their shorts all the time and my two favorites aren't sold anymore. The only pair that still sold. I like really really like are the Inner Glow modal Loom and shorts and modal is just mod Al and minor like this washed purple color that they don't really sell anymore, but they don't have a liner in them, which I love because  cuz my butt and hips just never fit in the liners of Lululemon shorts like it's so annoying I try to size up but like I'm a for Waste wise and if I try and size up for the underwear to fit me in it, I have to go to like an eight or a ten and then they're like way too big in the waist and too baggy and it's just like such a problem. So I really prefer the shorts that don't have liners and them as far as athletic tops and tank tops go whenever it's hot outside. I love wearing athletic tank tops and athletic shirts that are just like very breathable.  So my favorite tank tops from Lululemon. I'm only mentioning Lululemon cause it's only like brand. I really tried and Casual everyday like athletic clothes, but I love the ebb to straight tank. It's really great because it's like ribs and very soft and it has a built-in sports bra a very thin and cool lightweight material shirt. Is any of the swiftly Tech shirts? I love the short sleeve long sleeve and Razorbacks. I have two or three of the short sleeve swiftly text that I bought on sale at Lululemon.  I have one long sleeve one that I bought on sale and then I have one racerback tank top of swiftly tuck that I've bought on sale and then the cool racerback from Little lemon and the nulu fabric is to die for it's very very soft. And it's like thicker straps and a little bit thicker material than the swiftly text. So I really really love jackets hoodies awful user type of style. That's why I'm mainly mentioning those kinds of clothes. I have a defined jacket from Lululemon and it's a really great athletic athleisure material jacket like if  And he likes to go running. I feel like it's a really great jacket for doing that. But I personally just wear mine with a sports bra under it with leggings all the time. The scuba hoodie from Little Women is so comfy and soft. It's like a full zip jacket with a hood on it and the inside is fleece and it's very warm and cozy and I love it so much. It's such a great material and they have tons of colors and I recently got into like wearing oversized zip up folds up hoodies. They're just like so cute /  shirts and like tank tops. I feel like and I got this really oversized like kind of washed orange color one from American Eagle recently and I freaking love it as far as hoodies go most of my hoodies and sweatshirts are from just like my school like their University of Alabama ones, but I really just bite like by mine and huge sizes and I have a champion one that's fleece that I really like a lot but it's cropped so I don't wear it as often as far as like just basic everyday tops like, you know your casual  Extra casual plain tops goes I really love Urban Outfitters and target for these but if you really want to spend some money on like a really high-quality one that like looks really cute free peoples a great place to go. But once again, they're really pricey. So I recommend checking like Nordstrom Rack for free people stuff online before you buy like a full price Free People item. So joggers joggers are an essential part of my wardrobe and my two favorite pairs that I own are the misguided classic joggers. I have them in this light gray color, but how  Highly recommend sizing down because they will swallow you. I have them in a size for which I thought I was scared of them being too tight because I'm kind of in between four and six sometimes but I love them so much. I just wish I would have gotten a size 2 because the waste is pretty big and then I have these campus joggers from Victoria's Secret pink and black and their fleece-lined. They're super warm super comfy and super flattering and high waisted and I freaking love those and then athletic joggers. I have a pair of that's like not  I'm like my misguided and Victoria Secret ones are and actually wear them today. It's the Lululemon dance. Joggers. It's a very thin material but they're very comfy and I just really really like the fit of them. So that's everything for my clothing. But now I'm going to get into workout clothing if you guys want a full favorites for everything work out related. I highly recommend going to my YouTube channel. I posted a video that was like my all-time Fitness favorite. So like if you look up all time fitness favorites a be a salon you should be able to find it and I posted it this summer, so it's probably  From around like 6 months ago, but I'm just going to mention my favorite things clothing-wise. I love Jim shark sets. I pretty much only workout in gym shark now and occasionally like fabletics, but I don't really ever work out my Lulu Lemon anymore because I just save it to wear during the week to class and stuff. But my favorites from Jim shark are the vital seamless set and the camo seamless set and then I have the Whitney sentence that and I'm actually wearing it right now because I just got home from the gym and I haven't changed but I love the Whitney Simmons set so much. It's so comfy and I wish they still sold it but  You do want to get your hands on some gym shark sets. It's a lot more affordable than Lululemon and they're really cute really comfy. They're literally made for working out and the vital seamless and Camo seamless are my absolute favorite. And I also really like the flex that I don't know why I didn't put that down. The flex is a lot less compressive and Camo seamless vital seamless and I do like feeling kind of tightened sucked in whenever I work out. But sometimes I just really like the flex sex. It's really stretchy. I normally wear my sets just a sports bra and leggings to the gym. I used to hate doing it.  And think it was weird. But I really like it now and sometimes whenever my all my stats are dirty and I only have leggings left. I will wear crop tank tops and my absolute favorites. I've gotten from Forever 21 for really cheap just crop a little athleisure workout style tanks and Amazon has these like racerback tanks that are cropped and fitted and they're so great. So just like throw with whatever leggings and - from the brand hate. Oh pants. I don't really know.  It's called that but it's h ATO and then pants. So if you search that on Amazon like hit oh pants racerback tank women's I think it's around $12 and I got a white one and it just matches all my leggings and I really like wearing that to work out some other leggings that I really like a lot that aren't necessarily sets. If you're wanting like a good workout pair of leggings for them from Lululemon, if that's what you're really looking for fast and free or really great because they're very thin and there you can move in them very well, but fabletics do  Not sleep on them. They're seamless collection and power hold are so good especially for working out. I don't really choose them for day-to-day where before working out. They are incredible now, we're going to move into shoes really quickly. So for the gym, I've been wearing my Adidas Ultra boost 19 like the nine-year night 2019 addition. I guess the past few times because I recently got them last week for Black Friday and I freaking love them. It feels like I'm walking on a cloud and my feet do not ever hurt wearing them. I do wish I would have sized up.  I got an A and I am a true 8, but I'm more closer to an eight and a half and a size 8 or more closer to a nine then like a seven. I guess if I were to size up or down and I wish I would have gotten an eight and a half because I feel like they're a little bit tight on my foot, but I might just need to like adjust the laces, but they still fit me. Well if that makes sense, but another pair of shoes are the Adidas pod S3. I think that's what they're called, but they're really great for the gym the really comfy Adidas shoes because you can your foot  It can breathe in them. Really? Well, I feel like they're not very tight on your foot like the ultra boost far and they're kind of like a chunky platform sneaker in a sense, but they're athletic and they're not like fashion sneakers if that makes sense. And I just really love when my shoes have like a nice little platform on them and for just like a good pair of chunky sneakers that aren't like spending a ton of money on Yeezys or anything like that. It's crazy. I know chunky sneakers are such a huge Trend Adidas Falcons are incredible. They're so comfy and so chunky and I have a pair of off light ones and  Early always have some on sale on a d-des like Adidas Falcons are literally always on sale and Adidas and I got mine for $50 and they probably have a bunch of other colors for $50 on their my favorite everyday pair of tennis shoes that you can wear with like leggings and athleisure clothes and also like dress up a little bit kind of in the summer like with the sundress or something. Our Superga is oh my gosh. My super goes you guys have been through it all with me. I love them so much. They're just a white canvas sneaker with a big  key platform at the bottom and they look really uncomfortable and some people like do get blisters when they first get them, but I personally find that if I wear like a good pair of socks with them, they're so comfortable and I can wear them for forever and I really really like them a lot and I've had him for like a year and a half and last time I checked which was like two weeks ago. They were on sale on Amazon for forty seven dollars or 57. So definitely go check on Amazon for supper goes if you're wanting a pair my favorite pair of boots. I don't really like Boo  He's I would say but I wear like very like platform chunky boots because I'm So Into platform shoes just because they elongate my legs so much and make them look like so much thinner and toned. I feel like having that chunky sneaker does I don't know why it just looks like that to me. I have a pair that look kind of like Doc Martens, but they're from bershka and I got them off Asos. They're not sold anymore, but they're really great for the rain and they're just like ankle Chelsea style platform boots. And then I have a pair of from Nasty Gal that are like  Cleated platform boots that I absolutely love and then from Express there's a pair of Steve Madden platform black boots, and they have like a platform underneath the toe. So they look really really high but they're actually not that high because of the platform under the toe and they're really comfy. If you're like standing in them. I wore them for 12 hours the day of the Alabama LSU game and I literally walked home from the stadium which was like a 20-minute walk and the um, yes, my feet hurt really freaking out at the end of the day and I can hardly walk but still be wearing them for 12 hours. I would expect that.  Issues and to be standing at a football game for all four quarters. So that concludes my shoes besides I guess I should probably say my favorite like warm or boots because I just kind of said fashion boots, but I have many Uggs don't sleep on dogs either because they're so comfy and warm and when it does get cold, I love wearing them and I have the short version that are like mini. I don't know if they're called many or short uggs. I think there are many like the classic Mini to or something like that and I love them. The short ones are just so adorable.  And I just really love them. So now I'm just going to go into drinks because I thought this would be fun. This is what I'm going to wrap it up with because I know this episode is really long and I hope this was entertaining to you guys. I know that this only satisfies like some listeners and not Everyone likes to hear someone talk about their favorite things for this long. I wish I could have recorded this with someone else but that's kind of just the thing about having a solo podcasts with occasionally having guess sometimes I just don't have people to like feed off of me but this is like all of my favorite stuff and I feel like I've never even done a YouTube video.  I know where I've thought through and talk about my favorite things besides my fitness one. So anyways back to my drinks as far as alcoholic drinks goes only if you're 21 and up, of course the sounds crazy like when I say it to people but like I'll go to the bar and Order tea dose and water and that sounds psychotic. But what I do is I get Tito's and water because I don't really like soda water. It just I don't like carbonation at all really in general and I don't like soda so I get a Tito's water and I always bring a little Crystal Light liquid.  Not pouch. What are they? I guess it's a little plastic container, but I bring the Crystal Light liquid squirt bottle things and I will going to Tito's water and squirt my strawberry lemonade into it and it tastes incredible and it's like not so unhealthy and sugary for you because you're using Crystal Light instead of you know, a soda or something and that's my favorite and I really like that for vodka. I really like vodka and margaritas and like tequila, I like wine, but I just  Like crap when I drink wine, so I don't ever really choose to drink it unless it's just like a more classy event, obviously but skinny margarita with salt is also go to so freaking good with some good tequila. I really don't like crappy vodka and crappies tequila, but I also don't have crazy expensive taste. I just like getting Tito's or you know, like I don't know come some kind of like silver Patron or something for margaritas, but obviously when I'm in college most of the time I do just order whatever the house  House vodka or tequila is so skinny margarita with salt and Tito's water and Crystal Light are my absolute favorites and you do look crazy at the bar. Whenever you pull a crystallite little plastic container out of your person squirted into your drink, but who cares in my opinion, it's great for coffee whenever I go out to like Starbucks and get something. I've been loving their cold Brews with like the cold phone lately. I really love the pumpkin cream cold brew, but I only let myself get one like once a week because they are very sugary.  And I typically don't drink Dairy with my coffee, but I'm loving the Irish Cream cold brew from Starbucks for this Christmas holiday season, it is phenomenal and it's actually not terrible for you like as trouble for you is the pumpkin cream one was there's not as much sugar in it and it just tastes so good and it's like the perfect amount of sweetness without taking away from the strongness and boldness of the coffee and I love it. If I'm making coffee at home though. I have an espresso over 200 plus machine. It has changed my life. I got it for Christmas.  - two years ago actually, so it's still going after two years and I know my parents got it on sale for like 150 120 maybe and I believe all their machines are like 30 or 40 percent off on the Nespresso website and Target right now and maybe even at Bed Bath and Beyond there were really great deals Black Friday. So maybe still check it out because I know around the holiday season espresso and Target definitely always puts them on sale and I have the other 200-plus bundle that comes with the arrow to no milk frother, but my favorite pods I get the Alta see  Espresso pods and I'll just Brew one of those and then it's just a shot of espresso and then I'll pour about 3/4 cup to one cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and then just do like a splash of my creamer. My favorite creamer is the sulk almond milk vanilla creamer or the silk. Oh, yeah oat milk creamer and the flavor oatmeal cookie. Those are my like my all to all to all time favorite to Holy Grail creamers, and I know I didn't say  My coffee pod favorites if I'm getting like coffee pods from Nespresso to like brew a full eight ounce cup of coffee instead of an espresso shot. My favorites are the mallow zo and the vanilla Co like vanilla, but then as you or whatever they're both really great in the Colombian coffee was really good too, but it's a little bit more expensive. So I never order it. So that is all of my favorites. I am out of breath because my leggings are very compressed of right now and if I sound out of breath, that's why and I realized I probably should have changed before I started recording this but  Hope this helps you guys.

You're listening to David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. I was story but everybody can say okay. Okay. Oh, no, I think I can save I don't know if I can say it each week. You'll hear from me David Olson that skip this shitty Spears.com and me the lady duvet the Superfund co-host and it was yesterday. No, I did not hide debate then don't have a date now. Yeah. Yeah exactly POD at the age of 16 and pied now, we'll be discussing everything young people should be talking about  or are already talking about nothing is off limits are can be considered off-topic a Spotify original podcast. Now, it's getting harder and everyone's getting ready to go to their favorite festivals and other right be a chance that you'll see us performing Dave's out for a good time live at one of those festivals, especially if you're going to reading and Leeds and lots of cheer we are so excited. It's gonna be so fun. We are preparing all the most minut details for this like we want it to go off. It's gonna be so good. It is going to be amazing. So make sure  Get tickets and see when we can be happening at us. Make sure that all your friends no, no, we're not gonna go see Balu Lee eilish. We're gonna go see David's out for a good time. Even if they Clash  later in the episode will be discussing whether this on approach is the best way for celebrities to handle things after big Scandal and we'll also be joined by special guest Adam Lambert a Spotify original podcast typically in the lady and I like to divide up the topics with you know, one topic being very queer and the other not necessarily having to do so, but our last episode had both topics, they run the lgbtq community. So I thought you know what I've decided that both topics. This episode can be, you know, pretty straight. So I'm going to start off with one of my favorite types of straight straight up.  I'm talking about author Danielle Steel, you know, she's a 71 year-old IG body at this point. She's always popping on social media and she did a big video where she, you know discussed how you know young people today aren't working as hard as they should she says that she does 2222 hour work days and when he's on a deadline and she'll even work for 24 hours straight with no sleep. No food. Nothing. She says that on most days she wakes up. She has after 2 to 4 hours of sleep a slice of toast and an iced coffee and if she's, you know having an off day she might have a single square of bittersweet chocolate.  But and then start work for 20 to 22 hours fast of all, make sure she has not met me because I've been putting in the hours for you team and I have been at the library every day consistently for the past like month also consistently and also she's 61 71. Sorry.  And she's still walking like that Charlie. She can hire people and just collect the fruits of their labor. Why did this come from? She did it like this big video where she was talking about Millennials because she's mostly focusing on her son. She has nine children by late but her son in particular who's the youngest I believe and she was saying how with his work she had conversation with him about when if he doesn't finish something at work that day, you know back in the day people would stay late and might be in the office till 10 p.m. To finish what they were meant to do that day instead when it's the end of his like clock out hours. He goes home and that's it.  Tries have that work-life separation and she said like in her day that was not a thing like you went to work and then he went to home and I went home and that's it. And she just doesn't understand young people today and she thinks that they like have to cushioned of a lifestyle. Yeah, but people are miserable back then doing whack. Whack whack whack whack and no separation. Look at her hair. She can't be too happy doing that all the time. Well, she's that she's she'd rather be rich and miserable then poor and miserable Shinawatra same I'd rather be rich and as well as what to say, so she is worth 350.  Ian and has published a hundred seventy books in her lifetime. Would you change your current amount of sleep? How many hours of sleep do you get like fall? So you ready to get basically the same room as her? Yeah, so I was absolutely want to sleep you have and then only have like two to four hours of sleep, but be worth that amount - yeah, I'm thinking about my appearance. She can't be looking to Fresh sleeping. Like she's also 71. So who in the seventies does that would you translate My Man issue is she was saying about how a lot of it?  Is that people in their twenties and thirties nowadays want to travel and experience life and do all these fun new things but when she was growing up the 20s and 30s were the time you were meant to like work those insane hours. So that later in your life. You can relax and not have to work when you're unable to but the thing is that point doesn't make sense because she's 71 and still working. So what was the point of those 2222 hour work days for all your life and now you're 71 and you can't have a day off and just relax really good point to be honest. I think I think that she should just relax.  Ex. She's just got she's already got such a massive career and had books, like what they just circulate everywhere around the world still and I don't think any of them will ever be out of print. So she makes residual checks for days probably. Yeah, I know and the books are pretty similar as well, but she should just relax a 71. I would honestly be Mykonos. Yeah. So what are your tips for? You know people what do you think if you had to go talk to her you would say, well actually you're wrong because young people do XYZ like what would be your proof?  Our Lives aren't to cushioned and we are actually still working hard so like, you know, like the whole Apprentice wage thing of how like someone who is younger doing the same job as someone who is like double the age but getting paid less but doing the same hours probably that would be my prime example for ya honest about that the other day that is like quite a big motivator because like if I was going to a job where someone the same sorry significantly older than me, but at the same like entry level position, so like they have the same amount of experience with me was making like double or triple what I'm making just  As you know, the government decides if you're this age of make this amount, but if you're over this age make this analogy, I would a hundred percent be less motivated them to like stay and do extra work after yeah, because like, what was it like a couple years ago wasn't it? Like if you were under 17, it was 350 an hour and then if you're over 21, it was like six or seven or something. I think surround that stuff. No, I think they're making like double obviously the person who's older is gonna be the one that like is more like yeah sure I can do extra. It's telepresence on making fifty an hour who thinks like, I'd rather go home at this point.  And just like enjoy myself. Yeah, but then as well like apprentices do like the maddest hours as well and they're so young still. So I think I think that qualifies as the hardware but she's talking about not all of us are Instagram models or influences and also like like I know that writing is a difficult thing to do but for her it obviously comes so natural that if she's able to make money and people always say that she just rewrites the same book over and over with different names. But if that's what you'd like I think sitting at a table in your house by they like it's a home office.  And writing a book for 20 hours a day. We're probably all it's not just consistently writing its research and like making character profiles and all this is very different than working with a on a construction site for 20 to 22 hours. Yeah.  So recently both James Charles and Olivia Jade have taken the silent route following, you know, their latest big scandals Olivia moved out of her parents home. Stop publicly hanging out with other YouTubers and hasn't updated any social media while James is not a single apology video and then run for the hills when something big and negative happens is this silent approach the right way to handle things sometimes. Yeah, because I think if you look at the amount of like backlash some people get I think it's easy. Well not easy. I think it's better if you just stop.  Because if you if you try and fix God problems during that time, you make everyone even more upset and I think think it's the something that I would do just to just stop and take a step back and just leave it for a bit and come back when everyone's relaxed. So what would you do after your own hypothetical Scandal? Like if you did something bad and let's say again, it has nothing to do with foliage like in your own personal life, like on a personal friendship level and all your friends found out how would you react? I think I would explain  And then see my reaction from the explaining and if it's not good I'd leave it for a little bit because I think people people's emotions in the early stages of things are just kind of crazy. Everyone just says things that they end up regretting later and I don't ever want to put myself in a position like that with my friends. Would you do the same? It's such an awkward thing to do because it also depends on what the actual error codes Scandal is because there's somewhere you really do have to make it a bigger deal than others because if it's just  Like oh I heard you say something mean behind my back that I don't think I would go on this like celebration be like if I did it didn't I just address it and then move on because it would be so I feel like such a petty thing to make a big deal over. Yeah, but if it was like even I myself know like oh shit. This is a big thing. I think I would end up like maybe ghosting that group for a bit and then over to someone else. Yeah. Definitely. It's just awkward. So to what extent of a career do we expect for these, you know, social media stars to have after the Scandal because we're someone like Olivia Jade  Did she made like what two or three videos a week 230 Instagram posts a day and then vanish now for like a couple months, so can she come back and just carry on as normal anymore? I think it would be weird, you know because people would still expect it to address it but it's the whole thing of them celebrities or influences don't owe you anything so she could actually just continue as usual not talking about it and people will just have to get on with it after a while. It's really funny because with Olivia Jade specifically a camera from is our  That was with all the Alexander from season one or the one before it. So either Charli XCX or David dobrik but in one of those last three episodes we did a topic about like Ariel Winter and people posting on social media and like breaking the laws and we talked about Olivia Jade and I remember like me and you making it such a big point about like her life isn't as perfect as she's making it seem on social media and like she's definitely like drinking underage and all these bad things. Some of them were you were like, I knew she was a dumbass. That was when we found out she was  definitely a dumbass from the beginning. We didn't know she was a dumbass. I'm trying to think about and I'm like, who is this guy? Who is she gonna stay with your family comes back in six months David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. It's now time for our favorite segment from the inbox where you sent us your questions your dilemmas and anything else you got going on and you want advice.  So David, what is this week's thing. So ignore the fact that the lady just said thing in 2019. We're going to jump straight to the fact that neither of us are experts. Like we know nothing about nothing. We know, you know very well. It's lucky we survived this far in life is like, I mean literally like the breathing oxygen is a tough enough skill that I'm impressed we learned which is shaded me. It's not that hard to read.  Moving on let's out of this question and forget you no, no ladies difficulty. This this advice question says one of my friends is very flamboyant with his passion taste. I'm also gay so I feel like I can say this and we often do discuss a behind his back but sometimes it's too much if I want to pop down with him to Greg's for a steak baked. I don't want to wait for him to get his waist high latex boots and neon green mesh cropped up on in Winter. How do I have this conversation about his fashion making me uncomfortable, right?  This is kind of mean. I just don't like the way the person wrote. It is Shady. It was a question within that. Yeah, for sure. I think it's a matter of whatever that person was. Y'all not wearing it. That is my but you're ignoring the whole thing. It's like what we discussed in our Greyson Chance episode always, you know, you can go back and stream it. It's that whole thing about like straight passing and it's that thing about like when the waist on presents. If so, like I'm guessing the way this person has run the question. They probably dress very like are codes normal.  I like straight passing and saw those things like we don't know where they are. So like obviously in London, we see people just all types of ways. But like if they live in the middle of nowhere Town, it might be easier for safety reasons whatever for them to dress again are coats normally then dress like that to go to fucking Greg's still I mean, yeah, so then maybe depending on the place. Tell your friend your dressing to Ott, but also like make it like a thing of like, it's not you it's me like  You go on your own that's your prerogative. Do what you want to do. But like when I go, I don't feel like make it feel like it's a bigger thing than just not liking how they dress. Yeah, because I have friends like the lady who dress awful what but I know I let it go past. I like dress fresh. So to make a long answer very short. It is a shady way that you wanted it. I would maybe you don't own bath.  Back the tone when you go talk to them about it, but just reference the fact that it's a bigger thing than how they dress and when they're on their own or when they're doing their own thing. They can do whatever they want. But when they're with you for your own reasons and don't make it a thing of agile and how you dress make it seem like a safety net or something you'd prefer if they were a bit more minimalistic in their approach.

Before I came out to anybody in my family. I first talked to my best friend in 8th grade and I was at a point where I'd kind of been critically thinking about the feelings. I was having and asking myself like some real real questions about the emotions. I was experiencing and I felt that you know, I was ready to share this and we're sitting on the playground.  And I just kind of came out with it and I was like, hey, I think I might be bisexual and she was like you but not actually write like you're joking, right and I was like, yeah, uh-huh totally and I didn't come out to anybody else for three more years.  Thank you so much for sending your calling come out. We really appreciate it. If you'd also like to send your call and come out, please visit the shit nice peers.com and now it's time for the music segment. David's bobson bangers last week. You know, we redefined finally what about a banger is so no need for dictionary.com this episode go back stream the old episodes but with that in mind m'lady, I wouldn't know what Bops and being as you're adding this week to our playlist. First one is one that I reminds me of  secondary school, which is get down with the trumpets by Rizzle Kicks. Do you remember that song Oh, I have a story but nevermind I can say okay. Okay, and then my second song is Piece of Me by Britney. My next song is London by Lily Allen who she's been showing her mess lately. Have you seen all those like you say?  Recently lately as if it's not been a full career, but may I like her I say that as someone who likes her music like I've seen her life, but it's been a long-running mass. I love the fact that she's being honest about it though. And then I've got three escaped by Gwen Stefani always achoo. And then lastly I've got Get Jiggy With It by Will Smith because at the moment Will Smith has one of my favorite Instagram accounts. My favorite tracks this week include Stay Don't Go Away by David Guetta and Ray Milady has  feelings about David Guetta, even though she picked a David Guetta song about two weeks ago. Yeah. I said apart from who's that chick? I like I kind of hate him. I realized in two seasons. We've never featured Lord. The two times Lord has been on our playlist has been a call and come out track. Perfect places Kang come out. Oh, wow. So this is our first one. So I thought every time there's been a call and come out that's picked lord. It's been like a B-side but we've never featured our own favorite be side. So one of featuring this time is a world alone from Pure Heroin. Do you know that one? Hmm. That's a good track. It's nice.  Then I have this is what you came for by Calvin Harris and Rihanna. So, you know, we featured Rihanna quite a bit now, but I feel like this is an underrated one. And as well, I keep seeing those tweets, you know, the truth. I'm talking about where it says summer 19 is gonna be summer 60 that on crack and this was a summer 16 song. So that's a pump it up into summer 19. The next track is September by Earth Wind and Fire. Do you have to have a good Earth Wind & Fire song at every summer Gathering right play at work all the time. I like that by Janelle Monae you love Janome. I feel like this is my first time out.  In her but you've added her load and the song that has a secret gay history this week is Gods and Monsters by Lana Del Rey Lana track Gods and Monsters is just a part of Tropico a short film Lana created as a note to All Things Camp which you know was recently for the Met Gala that not everyone gathered the movie is all based around John Waters work the drag queen Divine and the designs of Bob Mackie. Lana says, they all helped again to the mental space required to create tropical and the track surrounding that such as my favorite from the film Gods and Monsters.  You're listening to David's out for a good time Spotify original podcast and we are here with Adam Lambert. You seem to be constantly busy. So the fact you have time for us we feel very grateful. Oh, this is gonna be fun. When did you get to London two days ago, and I'm before that I was in Berlin for two days and I'm going back to the states after this. No, I'm on Monday. I fly down to Sydney Australia, and I'm there for a week and then I turn around and come back to London lazy to do rehearsals with Queen for our summer to her and then I go to New York.  Work to do some more promotional stuff and then I go back to LA to actually do more rehearsal with queen and then we started to her book The Busy bugs and blast you've always had such a great career for so long, but then when I see tweets from like Taylor Swift putting your song on her playlist my gosh. I was like really or you know working with Queen all these Legends who are like such big fans of you. Do you still get Starstruck? Yeah. I mean with Queen it's like we're family now, I definitely I mean I do in moments I stopped and I realized wow, they're so  Iconic, but we've been working together now that it feels really familiar and really comfortable. But yeah moments like that Taylor Swift situation. I was like beside myself. I was so flattered, you know touring with Queen. Yeah. He's God's Hollis about that because they are they are like such a phenomenal band. They fully made that Mark. So what was that? Like first of all I auditioned for American Idol with a with Bohemian Rhapsody this on so they had seen it while I was competing on the show and then  Invited on to the finale to perform together with me and I was that blew my mind because that was Major and then one thing led to another we started after I put out my first album and my did my first solo tour we got together and did the EMA's and that was a blast and crazy and one thing led to another and we started doing more and more shows and then we did a big world tour and so on so forth. So it's been the gift that keeps on giving I never would have guessed that singing that song.  Would have led to me singing lead for the band now like all the time. I just wouldn't have I wouldn't have seen that coming because they're older do you ever get like any advice from them like like about the music business at all? Yeah. I mean a lot of it's sort of like they lead by example, you know, and I hear a lot of interesting stories and and they recount their experiences in the music industry and obviously the industry was much different at that time, but still the some of these big lessons are Timeless, you know, and and  And things like Artistic integrity and songwriting they never go out of style and it doesn't matter what year it is. Those are always going to be the way they are and I think they have a lot of integrity. That's one of the things that respect the most about them. They have reasons for doing everything that they do and they're very they're very careful in say for example, letting someone cover a song of theirs. It's like they have to know it's done on the right program the right kind of singer and that it won't be butchered. Yeah, you know what I mean?  So they're they're really they really care. But you have I guess like a history now of joining big groups having a great time. I mean you on Glee and this is the ten-year anniversary and I was a hardcore actually like every episode without fail did not miss. Yeah. It was a pretty sure like in seventh grade. I got in trouble like someone messaged me on Facebook being like every time you put a spoiler up. Oh, I was like, it's not that damn it school Glee. Yeah. It was exciting was that was crazy when I got the call to  There were like, yeah, you're gonna be like, I'm like six episodes as like what of course I was super excited and I said yes right away and then as I was getting to set the first day, I kind of thought to myself. I don't actually know what I'm doing actually no one audition me. They just kind of assumed. Yes. I had a background in theater and at the end of the day I figured it out and I got through it and I made it work, but I hadn't had any experience doing camera acting before. Yeah, and luckily. My first scene was with Chris Colfer who's the like the nicest?  Most down-to-earth guy in the world and that made me feel a lot more comfortable because much like Brian and Roger he sort of led by example and I asked a couple questions and just kind of observed and quickly learned what the hell I was doing. You know, it's so funny because now 10 years on the amount of cast members doing like these obviously the 10-year anniversary interviews and like whenever they like to talk about your experience. You just see like War memories I'm like that thousand-yard stare of those years. I mean, I think there was a it was such a big show I mean,  If you look at like the queer angle of it, I mean the stuff that Ryan Murphy did with the show with Chris has character and with the girls on the show. I mean they were really like pushing things that that kiss that that Chris and Darren Criss. Yeah gather that was sort of a milestone like that hadn't really been done on American Primetime television before so they like we're pushing real issues and real statements and then some of the behind-the-scenes stuff. There's a lot of personalities, you know, and you know, when I got announce that I was doing the show Cory actually  Ali died like a week later and so it was it was the most Bittersweet thing because I was really excited. But obviously I knew that tragedy happening was going to change the entire Vibe of the set. Yeah, and it was a little strange the energy was, you know, it was palpable people people felt it you can tell they felt it, you know, and and I could only imagine going into it. I was like God I can't imagine what this must be like for them this person that they worked with all the time. Yeah. Yeah, so I saw an interview did and it was the first of all it's so funny you  Have a lot of Charisma enthusiasm and all these interviews which is good because sometimes we have come in. It's just get lots of something come in and they're just like a situation but you talked about a high school party and how you were like quite near normal and I know I don't say conservative but not like a bad kid is definitely not conservative. No, but I was well behaved. Yeah. I was kind of a goody-goody and then you got wasted on tequila 1/2. Yeah one type I partied once in high school. I went to a yeah, I went to a party. Yeah, and it was just  a shambles. It was the one time I drank at a high school, but I was the only high school party. I got invited to actually because all the activities that I was involved in were like choir and much like a Glee kid was like choir and drama and all that stuff and half the kids that were in that were all Mormon so they weren't partying and it was like there was one girl in the drama program with me that was sort of like a bad girl. And of course she was the one that took me to this party. No. Yeah. It was really cheap tequila after eating way too much pizza and I got home and  Yo, yeah, but I like got in bed to go to bed and then like started falling asleep and literally just sat up puked all over my lap and pass back out. So in the morning, I woke up in the morning just hungover for the first time ever and kind of like sat up and was like, oh oh oh and if I had left myself a little Surprise Tiffany like Messi date story. Oh Soo many. I've had I felt like a lot of awkward dates, you know what I mean? Like where you're like talking to somebody and you like go to dinner and you're like doing all the  You're saying all the right things and you're like, yeah, I think we're flirting I think and then it's like the end of dinner and you're like, so what should we do? And you're like the like do the awkward kind of like, let's just walk over drown down the street and then like I've definitely a couple times like I'll lean in you know, I'm like, okay, I gotta kiss them. You know, I gotta kiss this guy in like see if it's a thing and then the like, oh like the dive away. I'm like, oh my God. I'm so embarrassed.  I have a friend who I think like two years ago was this one of my dates? Well, she's a girl. So maybe you are like diving back in, you know, you never know and she met you at a gay club in London when you were there with a bunch of friends. I think Sam Smith was also there. Uh-huh, and she had no idea who either of you were no clues. She's the type of drunk who will talk to a wall. He will talk to anyone and talk their ear off one of those. Yeah, and she talked to both of you and the next day in TMZ. There's a story that you and Sam Smith.  Hey TIG, I loved that story when we I texted him. Like are we dating? He's like no, I'm like wow, why are they think we're dating like as if two gay guys can't be friends. Yeah have a lot of gay friends. Yeah. I think it's the thing. It's like this token gay celebrities and their seen together and everyone just assumes it's romantic. But my favorite part of all like the TMZ story on it was the photo they used was you him and next you is her talking your ear off just a great Kiki. So then how did she feel the next day when she found out?  She projects in elevators about 500. So I already have you know high hopes for the type of drunk. You can be if I'm if she had been reviewing. I'm friendly I mean, I'm probably friendlier when I'm drunk actually then I am sober because I think sober I tend to be a little more reserved as far as like, you know, I just do my own thing. You know what I mean? I'm never mean to anybody but like just doing my own thing. Have you ever had any bad fan experiences?  I've had some weird weird fan experiences. Also, I mean I was leaving an event once and I like literally got into like my my security like ushered me into my car and the door was open and I get into the back seat and next to me and the other back seat. There's this woman sitting in there and she's like not look she's like staring Straight Ahead at the seat in front of her as if by doing that I wouldn't see her like that's her invisibility. Cloak is staring ahead and I kind of looked at  Hello, and she she didn't look at me. She went high and she kept staring forward and I was like, is this the right car and she was like, aah is it and I looked at the screen like this is and they pulled her out. She was a fan that hit like snuck in the other side of the car. I mean, it's one of those things. I like sometimes it's like a fun like oh this fan should be here, but I'll go with it. Anyways, like sometimes when they like on a stage like  it crash whatever and you're like mid-song and they just want like yeah. Yeah, exactly and you just hug them and then subtract them all that has happened maybe for yeah, and it's usually just the laughs, you know, and even this woman, I mean they weren't it wasn't scary shit wasn't dramatic. They just asked her politely leave and I was laughing the whole time it was so cuz I actually was like hats off. That's a that's a power move. Yeah could just jump off. It's okay. Yeah. I mean she went for it. So I wanna talk about the new music obviously. I love the video. Thanks how much creative control did you get in the process of that? You know, I think I've always been  Pretty outspoken and involved in everything that I've done but with this album in particular, I'm more in the driver seat than ever which is really nice. You know what I feel like I've earned that right. I've been in the business for a while. I've done this for a minute and I kind of said to myself when I started this project that I was going to follow a different sort of rule book that I had followed before because they're actually really is no rule book, especially in 2019, you know, people are releasing music as they want.  They're putting out what they want. There's music for everybody. And with this song new eyes, I you know, I have other songs in the album that are you know, maybe more like, you know, upbeat or higher energy or whatever, but I was like, you know what I really love this song this describes sort of where I'm at in my life right now and I want to put it out because I just it's the right song at the right time for me to kind of show people that I'm turning a corner. Stylistically. I'm taking some risks. I'm doing something different.  You know over the past like four years. I've been listening to a lot of alternative music as opposed to the straight up top 40 stuff. Yeah, and I've been really inspired by it, you know bands like Tame Impala and The Black Keys and jungle and like all these kind of like the it's not necessarily pop top 40 music, but it's dope. Yeah, so I'm just like, you know at the end of the day you can you can be in this business and you can very easily get wrapped up with like the game, you know, and command worrying so much about the competition of music.  And it's a lot of fun. And of course everybody wants a hit because you want people to hear your stuff. Yeah. It's easy to lose sight of like the music itself, you know, and and I think for me personally, I just made it a mission statement for myself on this project to have the music and the creativity be at the Forefront of everything that I did something that I'm really excited about that ends with it to be continued. So what is the continuation very soon very soon as we also have you filmed it. Yeah, and this is store for the entire album era is this going to have a storyline. Well, at least the next video. I don't know I haven't  Figured out all the other steps yet. I love fans are so funny though. Like they always ask me. Like are you is this happening? Are you I'm like, I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. Like I think they think everything is planned out like everything and I do maybe there's some artists that do that but like I'm taking it I'm taking it step by step. No, I think that's it. I think we've just been like Jagger it into the heart because you know telephone part 2. Where is that? Lady Beyonce? I lift the heart of God. They said dangerous woman was enough apart to where's that where yeah, I promise I will not do any of that.  I will not do any blue balls. Do not commit to a to be continued on as well. They had to know. Okay now suddenly gonna go back in and edit out the last to be continued in the next video. Let's grab it. Yeah, if it continues it continues that when you tighten the neck, the next video is a continuation 100% What does pride month and pride mean to you? I mean so much rainbows gay bars. No, it's you know for me. I think that the heart of Pride it's knowing who you are and celebrating it.  And not making any in a any apologies not not catering to somebody's ignorance. You know, it's kind of to me. I've always kind of felt like if someone doesn't like what I'm about or there, you know prejudiced against it. Fuck them. Like I don't have time for that. Yeah, you know what I mean? And and obviously it's not as simple as that and a lot of people are growing up in the world where they're in a family that doesn't accept them or their Community doesn't accept them. And that is tough. It is really hard and my heart goes out to those people but  I would say instead of trying to focus on the negative. Try the best. You can to try to find some silver lining meet somebody that understands you reach out. I mean, we do all have the internet now, you can talk to people in other places. Yeah, just find some allies find some some some people on your team and to get the support that might not be there. The internet is such a double-edged sword though. I always hear even in that last answer, you know, it goes from social media and Instagram the internet's making everything feel so fast paced, but then we also hear about  How the interconnectedness and globalization means you can find your tribe your community that otherwise you wouldn't you know, the one of the reasons I started this podcast and remember my first meeting for Spotify, you know mentioning this is that sometimes you know for the small kid in the middle of nowhere Town something as simple, as you know, hearing three people that they can relate to just have a laugh and share their stories makes them feel less. Like I'm the only person it's huge. I mean that was for me becoming a pop musician like I didn't sign up for  American Idol because I thought that I was going to influence young people. It wasn't part of my thought process. I was just like I just want to saying and then as it all kind of unfolded I realized the power that a platform has, you know, and I realized being one of the few openly gay musicians in the u.s. When I started there was some responsibility there, you know, and I had to kind of look at that and take it on or choose not to and there was a little Crossroads where I was like, okay, I this is a moment where I can do some good and what's actually  Heart of this is greater than me and greater than my career. It's actually being able to affect the lives of people and I love it. Now. Like I love the fact that that I can lead by example if I want to I can I can try to offer advice I can offer strength and also just as important some cases is offering some escapism and that's the beauty about music as music can kind of paint you into any mood you want to be in I think it's nice to be able to look at the charts and see you and  Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko and column Scott and all these people who are doing so well and into think, you know, even 20 years ago. It was not that easy, you know, if we didn't set it like, you know, even 10 years ago was it mean when I got off idle it was like there was nobody in the US on a main Makai major label that was doing like a main pop release. There was no there no gay people. So that meant that all the studio folks that were putting this together the the labels and such and radio people although I had a lot of support  Suddenly from them. They were still scared because they didn't understand if it was marketable or not and they were taking a risk and you know, the music industry at that point was still kind of like struggling and limping along from the whole MP3 boom. So it was it was hard because there was no real like blueprint and there was no way for me to look at oh, but someone says doing this, so can't we you know and man it's been an interesting 10 years and even seven years ago. I released my second album and it was the first  US release by a gay artist to go number one on the billboard chart and I remember when I was told that at the time I thought that's not true. There's no way like there's definitely people have done that before apparently there hadn't been and that was seven years ago. So it's happened so fast that like snowball of progress and change and I'm really really happy to be a part of it and I to I look around at all these artists that are queer and it's clearly like commercially viable and there's an audience for these artists and  It's exciting. Yeah, it's exciting because we are changing the industry. I think something that I really admire in a lot of musicians as well is that there's no longer that fear or pressure to hide who you are. And if anything it's the opposite. It's the encouragement to be who you are. I remember when you know, what are we put this on the David's bobson bangers playlist two weeks back something strangers, which is Lauren Jauregui always pronounce her name. Sorry. I love Fifth Harmony and Halsey, you know, I remember Halsey saying in an interview with rolling.  Known that the first time she did the track the label said great. We think the featured vocalist should be Katy Perry and her instant answer was I want someone at the song is about bisexuality and being with a girl I prefer someone like Lauren who is on the same label as me, but it'd be nice that it feels really authentic and she can relate to what she's actually singing. Yeah, it's real. Yeah, I agree because I actually I mean maybe I'm a skeptic and maybe I shouldn't be saying this but I do think there's a case of and I wouldn't name names because I don't know exactly but I have a feeling that it's become a  Trendy to be you know queer and I would guess that there are probably a couple artists out there that claim it that might not actually be it. Yeah, doesn't it feel like that a little bit? No, I see it. I know you mean but even that's a little like then again, who am I to write back? It's not my business to like call anybody out exactly but it's kind of like, all right. Yeah, but even that I think sexuality is such a spectrum that whenever I hear someone saying they're a member of the community without being explicit. It's one of those things.  Of sometimes it's not necessarily saying I'm gay or I'm lesbian or bisexual whatever it is. I think it's on those things of they just say like, well, I'm a bit more open than what the binary might make me seem, right and that's and that's fair and I think that's the beauty of like this this umbrella term queer now is that it's not as clear-cut. Yeah. It is sort of like everything, you know, which is great and I like that we're using it and I like that we're we're using it because it is inclusive. It doesn't it? One of the issues that I have is all these identities and labels. It's necessary for people to understand who  What they are and to communicate who and what they are to other people but it does get a little overwhelming all these different like types and classifications. And so it's nice to be able to say, okay. Look we're all part of the queer family. We're all left of center. We're not hetero, so we're all a family and I think the more we kind of lean into just relating to each other because oh, hey you're different. I'm different and not well, I'm in the gay line and you're in the byline and you're in the gender fluid line and  That it just I feel like it can very easily become more dividing and that's what they you know what I mean. Like, I think we're all getting a I've seen it where people are getting a bit carried away with all the labels and maybe that's some maybe that's the next step. I think it's one of those things though of and you know, we get a lot of advice questions and people wanting support and wanting to know how to do XYZ and one of the first things I think about is there's some people like to put it in a contemporary example that listeners might notice like even in love Simon one of the really smart things the directors and writers did is that  Up until the very end of the movie whatever, you know Simon talk about his sexuality. He never explicitly like, oh I'm gay. But a lot it's always just like close to the word or he says, he likes guys and it's only what he actually says that actual phrase that he feels like the weight off his shirt. Finally The Liberation. Yeah. I think that something a lot of people don't even think about mentally they know who they are and they might feel comfortable in that but there's something liberating not being able to say it. Yeah and feel like I can say and not feel like a weight of shame or any associated with it. It's like a big step. Yeah. It's  The big step. Yeah, so we love that movie was so sweet. How many times did you see it just the once I thought once but I really liked it. I thought it very Charming super chunky is it's a book isn't you cried when he saw it? Yeah. I did. It was so sweet. How do you guys feel about so many cases of gay characters in big movies played by straight people. Well, I think in this particular  If it case I think Nick Robinson answered it really well in the frame of you know, Greg berlanti who's gay and is the director picked him and it was a situation where he felt like if you know, it's not a free pass. That's not the right terminology. It's almost like if they're saying that he's the best for this role and he's the person who makes the most sense then maybe it's like he should speak on their behalf and say well I shouldn't do this because gay people might feel bad about total. I mean, I think you're right. Like, I don't think that questions to be put upon the  Actor because an actor just wants to work, you know an actor just wants a gig and it's competitive out there. I don't think it's really it's not really something that that should be put on the actor. It's the choices made by the studio and the casting director and such and director and such and so forth so we know about you you donate to a lot of Charities and you support a lot of causes. It's that any sort of activist in you'd like our listeners to pay attention to there's an organization here in the UK called Mosaic and it's a  A youth program like a community youth program and last year. I went and visited and chatted with the kids and just did like an informal QA and it was so nice to just talk and connect an interface with young people. All different backgrounds was super diverse, you know and and hear their experiences and ask answer questions and ask questions to them about what it's like to be young like a teenager growing up and being gay or queer or whatever you are, you know and  I loved it. So Mosaic. You should check them out. We'll make sure to thank you so much out of breath. Yeah, my pleasure.

You're listening to another episode of BJJ psychologist. And I'm your host. Dr. Yasi Pujols. I am a clinical psychologist and Jiu-Jitsu practitioner and today is Saturday, July 27th, 2019. I'm talking about my recent trip to Manhattan New York City with my sister and I have to say we had such a good time. Usually make it out to New York about once or twice a year. We kind of fell off the last few years. But here we are back in the Big Apple and man is so much fun. And if you followed me in my stories, I just had such a blast recording everything and the scenery and the food. Yes, the food now, I think this came as a surprise to many people and I realized  Eli's now thinking back. Okay, it look like I ate a lot of doughnuts.  The reality is that it looked like I had I would say for donuts and a bagel or two. So the way we did it is my sister would pick out a flavor or a type of bagel a donut flavor or type of bagel and  And I would pick one as well. We would split each one down the middle and then we would switch so we could try a little bit of each and seriously that comes out to one Bagel sandwich in one flavor is one half and the other half was another flavor and the same with the donuts. So I may have looked like I was eating a whole ton of donuts, but the reality is that we were sharing and  And honestly, I don't have that many donuts, but I do make it a huge production what I do I mean come on. It's so tasty. So when I'm enjoying one, I really really take my time and record and document my donut adventures and this one was just spectacular. I had a cronuts so that's it.  A croissant doughnut croissant like shaped like a donut and cooked like a donut or fried like a donut. Let's be real here and it was covered with the most delicious. I wouldn't say glaze it was more like a good Nosh with a cannoli filling in the little doughnut hole and then the other one was half of a it was called the Bronx for the donut Pub.  At no wait for the doughnut project the Bronx Donut had like this Amazing Glaze that had some olive oil in it. Not really sure. What else I did. I don't remember what it was and then the second donut was a an old-fashioned lemon poppyseed donut. That was just uh, oh man. I'm so glad I don't live near those places because we'd have some major problems probably have to go up a division.  No, I wouldn't let myself do that. But I would thoroughly enjoy a donut. Probably Weekly right now. I'm probably at a one donut per month. And right now I'm sorry two doses per month and right now and training camp. That's one donut per month. Although I did sneak in the donuts the pizza slice of pizza and  Bagels so if with a piece of the bagel, I didn't have all of the the bread part. I just had like picked off the toppings off the pizza and a little bit of bread and then I only ate half of the bagel bread. So that's how we do it. I I'm tasting tasting and trying and then just leaving the rest and it's really hard to just leave uneaten delicious bread on the table. So as soon as I'm done, I gather that bread up and I walk it to the  So that's a little Pro tip there for you. If you try to reduce carbon take and it's the most amazing delicious carbs ever just throw it away as soon as possible or have the waiter or waitress remove it from your site because man, you'll just pick at it and keep eating keep eating. I mean, that's what I do and when it's tempting and in front of you that's almost impossible. So the other point I'd like to  like to bring up about my New York trip is my sister is a runner. She has a weekly running group called run Tuesdays that happens. Hello on Tuesday about 6:30 in downtown Houston, and she's been running that since 2016 and I'm super proud of her for doing that. Although I do not run. I used to run. I used to be a marathon. Junkie. I was a marathon Race drunky. I would just run.  Long distances, I remember one time. I was just running like 18 miles like I'm gonna go on my 18 mile run today. It's Saturday and just thinking to myself like what am I doing? Where am I going? I'm not signed up for any kind of race. It just felt really good to accomplish something major like that and boy, did I run I ran a lot.  So she has continued that and I have obviously transition to Jujitsu where there's a very very very minimal running maybe a few laps at being of class. If if I'm at a school that's jogging like that. So we walked everywhere in New York. We took some Subways but of course like when you walk out of your hotel, you have to hike over to the nearest Subway and it's block after block after block.  After block and my legs and calves were so sore that it was kind of hobbling every time I would get up from sitting because of the sword is and I'd ask her like, hey rui rui this sore. She's like nope. And then when I went to train at Unity, my friend asked. Hey, so are your calves really sore. I just looked at him like oh my gosh. Yeah.  Yes, they are sooo. So so so sore they're killing me right out and thankfully Jiu-Jitsu kind of ironed out the Kinks so I didn't get as sore but coming back, you know on the plane I could just like touch my calves massage my calves and feel the the sword is permeating through the entire muscle. So I was say if you're heading out to New York and you're not a walker or a runner.  Be prepared be prepared to soak your feet and your calves because they are going to take a beating. I would say I'd had I'll definitely prepare better next time and then also I feel so Texan like we spend so much time in our cars and walking around in the city. You you break out into a sweat your walk in like 10 minutes here 10 minutes there 15 minutes over there.  There and so it's just really remarkable the contrast of how little I'm walking these days. So just going to take a mental note once I move in September. I am definitely going to try to beat it to do more walking. I'll be in an area where I can walk to some local places maybe during the daytime not at night. It's downtown Houston.  Not sure if I wanted to be doing that, but definitely for a really cute breakfast taco spot and there's a Coffee Spot in walking distance and my lifting gym will be walking distance. So, let's see if I could stick to it. Oh, hey, maybe a bicycle. Maybe I could get a bicycle. That'd be awesome. Well, actually I have a bicycle. Maybe I can repair my old ancient bicycle once I move, but I would love to  Keep you all posted on the huge move. I sold my house earlier last month and now getting into a new one. That's not as far. All right, please consider traveling up to New York City checking out the cool Jiu-Jitsu over there. I had a great time and it's not the first gym I visited when I go back I want to really visit some of the other places. I didn't get a chance to visit.  Of so, if you want, I'm over on Instagram. You can follow me and my whiny sore legs tracking throughout the day and that's at Dr. Dot yasi underscore fit and thank you for listening.
You're listening to episode 2 of David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast each week away from me David ocean etske of the shitty Spears.com and me Melody. Do it the Superfund co-host as we'll discuss everything young people should be talking about already talking about nothing is off limits or can be considered off topic. So the lady I want to know why you can fly as hell today you like a Shanti in John Tucker Must Die. You've got the eyelashes get the eyebrows on fleek. You've gone Alfred. I've never seen you wear when we go clubbing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I had a date today and I was really excited to see him because I thought he had pied me and it was over and you were not going to talk anymore and then last night he hits me up and he's like I'm leaving soon. I want to see you before I leave and I was just like Angels playing in the background choir singing in the background as he offered me this date. And then today I get here he cancels because he has work. How do you read your rotor on how you're going to organize something with me? And then like read your own wrong? Yeah, but like you don't  like a scrub who doesn't work at all like I'd rather have someone like sorry. I'm working today. But like we can meet tomorrow then someone who doesn't never work. I know but I got my hopes up. I've been getting pied so much. Did you learn nothing from TLC? What about you? What have you been up to? Okay. So basically right now it's like fashion. We can all these different cities New York, Milan London Paris, like they're all back to back and you know with London Fashion Week, I got invited to a really cool party. And when I was there from the moment I walked in I felt not only underdressed but I also felt like  So out of place like it wasn't just like models is also all these like agents or business people or journalists and they all were like popping. They look like you today and then like I literally feel like a potato like someone had just gone to the store pick the potato and then they just threw it into this party. Like I did not fit in it was so everyone was so nice. It's like a stereotype that like, oh, they're all like a fashion industry. People are so bitchy like know everyone was so nice and like there's an open bar was like a fun vibe, but I just felt out of it didn't feel like I should be there. Did you get lit did you get lost in the sauce? I didn't end up.  You know, so it was so funny to see the night like go downhill very fast because when you first arrived it was like all these fancy like Butler's with like platters and then on them they had all these cocktails that were like made to Perfection. They were like they had to one was Vanilla Essence cherries, like a mentor vodka all these things added and then the other one was like a summer thing with cranberries and then grapes on top garnishing and then like an hour in no more of those drinks on the platters instead like they were basically  Doing vodka Cranberries or like vodka lemonade because there was only three bartenders and I think probably like 200 people and so they were just like manically making either strawberry vodka Cranberries or vodka lemonade and then just slamming them down on the table and people just grabbing that no one's getting champagne except for me and I did that on purpose because even if I like the potato in the room, I won't be that one bit. So I was walking over the fat a champagne glass bubbles. I've had like two steps of the champagne. I just want to be like that bitch the corner with a champagne glass.  Coming up later on episode 2 of David's out for a good time. We've got a big story on India legalizing homosexuality. And what happened when dually visited China we've also got a great segment of David's Boston bangers. Can't wait to see what the lady gives us. We've also gotten excellent interview with our special guest girly David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast, but first the lady fani CGI IG baddies, that's too many letters. It sounds like an STD though. I don't why? Why do you ask so you've never had a little Michaela now, you've never heard of Margaret.  You know her - ooh do literally no. I'm just throwing names that you know, I know but those three names are like the biggest CJ IG bodies at the minute. So like we sort of know what an IG body is correct. Yeah slim waist popping at every seam career goals be good IG body salut. Michaela for example isn't a G-Body certified. She's popping at every possible point with 1.4 million followers on Instagram. So the song  Bauer who has arms like A.J. Tracy and Mia, but she's not a real person. So CGI, it's just completely photoshopped. It's a guy that takes photos and then just Place her into them and they promote Brands like H&M Zara and then also more upscale stuff. So those two seater models Margo and shoudou are promoting bombs current range. That's insane. It's so keep that they make so much money when it's just he's like man in basements that I like drawing them together. When there's Real Models out there that have to pay like rent and phone bills or car payments and it's  It's like guy in a basement making hella coin off a girl that isn't real and it has four other fake girls is my G. How much do you reckon? She's earning. Do you know how much she's earning? No, but you have to remember like it's not like a small like these are big company. Yeah, they're paying how a coin it's so messed up. And the thing is there was this model that was talking about how soshu do is a model who is very clearly like very dark-skinned black and she's taking a job that could be fulfilled by an actual back model because like it's so difficult to model in general but like there's even  Unless positions for models of ethnic backgrounds because so many branches want like generic blond white girls. Very true. And so like there's a girl out there who's a model who's black and like it's her dream to work with Obama and the like hard pass actually going to work with this fake girl. Can you imagine if there's like a guy that actually doesn't know that like, what's the name Lil Michaela and the other girl that doesn't have that likes to do. Yeah, but doesn't know about that like CGI you like even if little Mikayla was real. Can you imagine being like, hey guys meet my girlfriend little Michaela. It's so  It is so it and then he's like messaging them like oh, yeah, let's meet up and he's and the guy in the basements like oh, yeah, of course getting paid off like you what if you're at what if the guy was meant to meet you today is actually CJ model. I would actually cry. I feel like I've been catfished big-time called Nev MTB is on the gays catfish the IG body special on this week's episode. We meet three people have been catfished by CGI IG batteries. This is such a good f is I'd actually watch that. But yeah, but  those critics like there's a fashion photographer called Manny Roman and he said well, I do admire the campaign's digital art. I don't like the non-realistic message that bomb on a sending out to society because we have to remember that a real model like the one that complain about shoudou can't like something like contort their body to fit the campaign. Barrois. Maybe just wanted a very natural slim looking person not natural for getting CGI models but a very slim figure but let's say suddenly they want shoe do for a campaign to promote a plus size range that are no Forever 21 all I have to do with something like Photoshop or to look plus size and a real model can't do that. She can't  Jump around to all these different categories and it's not fair at all Christian. It's cheating is cheating the system exactly and it's this guy. He probably has no interest in the fashion industry or modeling. I know that's putting words in his mouth and it's more than one guy anyways, but it's just it's just not fair for anyone involved in this industry who works really hard and probably one of those for a lot longer than he has seen it as an easy cash grab and it's unfair and I feel like there will be little girls that look at things like that and be like, oh look at this person who's not even real doing all these things. Maybe I could do it take  example from that and then you've got like anorexia van is like it's a serious thing amongst like younger girls. You can see girls partly take influence from what they see online and social media is a big thing and that I think having a CGI model in this is just going to make shit worse. I could easily imagine following some like little Michaela because some of the people in her photos are real people, you know, they always just take a normal like digital camera photo and then edit her in. Yeah. So there's like a photos of her with her boyfriend who's a real person and it's just so messed up because they go in like you  Dates together and all these things we have to remember that she's not actually there's not real person and it and it's an actor. He knows that she's not a real person either obviously. He's just posing for these photos because some people see that as an example for like a good relationship model a false sense of reality man. It shouldn't be happening. But people some people are dumb enough to fall for that. Exactly. I think our view is that we don't think they should be working with Brands, especially when it's stealing jobs from people who, you know make a living from this to that and as well low McHale has a blue tick on Instagram says wild. Yeah because a lot of movies  TV shows like American Vandal on Netflix like that. They have characters on these social media accounts and they aren't given real accounts Instagram Twitter all these sites. Don't let you create anything for a character. Even if it's for a movie or TV show because it's about being a real person. They don't want these fake aliases, especially when it's something like little Michaela who's an entirely fake person. There isn't anyone behind little Michaela and the Michaela still given a Blue Tick. So I think maybe there should be something where one her Bluetec needs to go. But to there should be something where it gives them a this is not a real person like, you know on Twitter.  Those Dory counts for those Twitter accounts that are like parody accounts. Yeah, it should have something in the bio saying this is not a real because it's probably because out there no offense, but like I wasn't smart seven-year-old and the seven-year-olds on Instagram who are going to find these accounts and maybe we think it's real person. If we were on the Streets of London New York Sydney, wherever and showed photos of shoudou Margo, Lou Michaela, someone's gonna think it's real a Spotify original podcast on the 6th of September 2018 the Supreme Court of India decriminalize homosexuality by declaring section 377 of the Indian penal code.  Unconstitutional so that means a lady now. What does that mean? It means that now it's safe to be gay in India. That's brilliant. I think it's crazy how that's only just happened. But then again think of all the other countries that is like yet like something like that is yet to begin like a lot of places in Africa still have nothing like that. So I think it's brilliant is a good step forward for Asia. Absolutely. But like you said, there's so many countries that aren't even close. But we also remember like when I first saw this on social media, a lot of people were talked about like  Marriage all these things but it's not even about that. It's just like being able to be gay in India and being out. Yeah being you in your own like in your own home. You have people that run away from home, but it's like I'm Indian. I want to love someone the same as me. I'm able to now which is crazy. It's nice because I feel like India has one fifth of the population of the world. Yeah. So that's means one fifth of the world is now able to be who they want to be 1/5 of the world and it's just crazy other countries should look at this and take example and  Try and push this especially privileged people can do the most so total listeners where your heritage from Africa's I am from Zimbabwe. So hypothetically you're going back to Zimbabwe for a holiday. Mmm. It's not legal there. Is it? No, would you feel safe having me come with you someone who's not only out but it's out and it's like a vaguely public figure in like three Taco Bell's I guess. Yeah, I could but I'd have to keep you at arm's length Okay. So with that in mind, would you be more likely to go on holiday with me to India now that this  Has been repealed. Yeah, of course that we would both be comfortable there. I would love to go to India like everything about it. Like it's so beautiful in the culture. So interesting in the history, so interesting, I got to go to Every Museum every site and the food and the music. Yeah, India we come in for you but moving on another country in Asia is also kind of on social media and not such a positive light basically do a leap into the show in China and Shanghai specifically. Are you big fan of du Lieber? Yeah. She's cool.  And so what happened is in Shanghai where her show was everyone had to be seated during the show you were not allowed to stand and I'm like Miss Thing I will stand at a dually per show and it's just really awkward. But then on top of that do we pose like a massive lgbtq a lie. So a ton of people want her show with pride flags and they were beaten they were assaulted and some of them are hospitalized and this isn't allegations. There's a heck of video mad heck of video not yeah. I saw those their kids. They're just kids. They literally look young.  With an awesome my Skin's popping sigh look quite young but it's just sad because imagine going to a daily Patrol being like the biggest do a stat knowing everywhere to a Bop like new rules, but also album Cuts Like A dreams and then being there and seeing a girl two rows next to being beaten just for holding a pride flag or something would be in just for standing not even a private just standing during the show is horrific. The videos are actually horrific and it's just crazy how they could do that the thing I'm happy with her is that she made a point about  It and she made a statement even during the show. She said I just wanted to really enjoy the amount of show. We have left. I want everyone to be happy and feel safe here. But at the end of the day, she can say all she wants she can raise every statement but it's not going to change its special exactly. She she didn't choose personally. I feel like to perform their these artists have booking agents or touring companies that decide for them. But like if you were an artist having seen what happened to Julie was fans at her show and let's pretend you have a somewhere audience of a lot of queer fans and young people. Would you want performance Shanghai having seen this video?  God not avoid it I'd avoid it because my fans couldn't be who they want to be and they couldn't enjoy my music properly which is why they've spent all the time and effort, you know, you have people that travel from all over the world to fly to one place to watch someone and it's just like they can't even they can't even do that properly half the people on social media were blaming do it, but the other half on social media were blaming the fans themself because they know the rules they live there. It's not like Duo who flew out for this one show they've been there for their whole life and they should know don't stand during the show or  don't bring my pride flag to wave during the show and they decide to do anyway, so they put them at risk. Who do you think is that blame neither? Exactly? That's why I think is well neither is just a really unfortunate situation for everyone involved. So what do you thinks gonna happen now? Do you think loads of celebrities will be put off or do you think the same thing will happen in general performing a China's really difficult. So for example, Katy Perry's men to perform at the Victoria's Secret show that was in China and they wouldn't let her because a couple years ago. She performed in either in Taiwan or something promoting Taiwan which has issues with China.  And they wouldn't approve her to perform. So she didn't perform. They had someone else coming. I think it was Harry Styles. So they really like that every performance make sure that they will not cause a scene so in honestly maybe duo will be even allowed because of her same after she didn't blame the Chinese government of police, but it was negative enough and Broad enough negative attention. I think probably won't let her come back but it isn't just do a leap and China this other countries and artists involved in this and there's been so many cases. I've seen Twitter moment about it a Twitter moment. Okay, we have artists performing the UAE like Dubai or in  Russia and other places where there's human rights issues and Israel as well. So for example Lana Del Rey when she want to perform in Israel, her solution was a two-party State type of solution. She want to do one show at the festival in Tel Aviv, and then the other in Palestine but in the end she just didn't do either when Lord wants to perform an Israel. She canceled her show which made a lot of people happy, but then she ended up doing her next two shows in Russia, which is you know, not the best place to be a queer fan. So what do you think would you be able to perform in these countries? I would perform on the grounds that  We come to an agreement. Like this is my show I do it how I want in this particular space, but the blame shouldn't fall with the artist ever know like, you know, I think I'm not on do as level or you know anywhere close. I'm still you know far from but like in my experience what I've been told to go here go to this place you're turning up here. I don't get that much notice and I'm not really given that much time to like Research into everything about that place. So the responsibly should fall with the promoter or the booking agent.  They should know. Okay. Well, this is due as demographic. She has a lot of queer fans. There's a lot of queer people in China who probably want to see her but it won't be safe to put them in this situation for the safety of everyone do it should not perform there or if she does let's put out a festival or let's put her somewhere where it's going to be 80,000 people or something. We're inside of a small intimate venue where it's gonna be a lot more difficult for the police or first, you know security to spot these people with flags or Spa people standing up. I agree, you know from my personal point of view just to end this point. I think that if  I was there as a fan. I want to see them so bad I'd want us to do I'd want to seal on I'd want to seal or whoever it is. And I'd sort of feel like it's not fair that I'm getting punished as a fan if they cancel because of my government's decisions and it's not fair if I'm not able to relax and try myself again if they perform because of the government, I'd always feel like I lose in either situation either see the show and don't get to enjoy myself or I don't get to see the show and I don't get to enjoy myself. So if I was the artist, I'd want to find a way to perform their in a  Elway something like a festival or I'd want to find a place that I can form nearby that is easy for them to you know, travel to I know not even have the money to travel to but you know, it's one thing for a fan from China to fly to LA to see do it. It's another for her to fly to let's say India now and perform their David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast.  This week. We got a great question from an anonymous Tumblr user who asked us. I'm an 18 year old American starting University and my boyfriend is attending a university about a two-hour Drive Away distance is in our issue, but our issue is that he isn't out and I am in high school. We started dating December it was fine because he kept reassuring me it would happen over the summer just before he moves into dorms where he'd feel safe, but he still isn't out and he isn't even out to friends. I don't feel like being in the Sikh relationship, but I do like being with him. What do I do further to this? He recently mentioned  Being in an open relationship. I'm not sure how I feel about this and then all caps help me. What do you think the lady it sounds a bit like, oh my God, I'm giving up but it's I think it sounds messy boots. That sounds like I think he shouldn't be with him. He would get his heart broken by being with someone that isn't ready to be out yet. It shouldn't force him to be out like someone should come out in their own time, but I don't think it's healthy for you to stay in a relationship with someone like that. It's not going to end up well for you and this whole thing of an open relationship.  Lots where's this idea come from? It makes no sense because you be you two have been together for so long and it's just like he wants to see other people while still being with you unfair this whole thing seems a little bit unfair to you, especially because he said doesn't is our issues they brought obviously discussed the whole distance thing. It is a two-hour drive away. So if he can see you, why isn't he? Why does he need someone else's I wanna go sis tell us that it's greediness sometimes when it is greedy, but  Me and the lady have discussed openly ships before and neither of us would ever really want to be in one. So first maybe we should just address that cause that's the smaller question never open relationship side. I don't think you should be in one because you don't seem very confident in if you were you wouldn't have to ask us if we think you should be alone. You should just know you'll be running right won't be in one exactly. So if you're leaning on the side of I don't know that's probably you know, I could never I just I feel like if I'm with someone I just want to be more than enough for them. They don't need anyone else and that's not to say people shouldn't be in one because there's definitely relationship.  They were people like make it work and it suits them but I personally could never be in one and the lady you kind of too jealous to jealous this whole thing of like sharing someone that you care about no way. I think at the end of day and open relationship doesn't automatically because a lot people like to say this and open relationship doesn't automatically make your relationship aggressive which is what a lot of people like to say it is and at the same time being in a you know, monogamous, you know, heteronormative relationship doesn't automatically make you boring. Neither of those statements are like, you know concrete  Just because you don't be in an operation doesn't mean you're not Progressive and just because you're in like a heteronormative normal one-on-one. Monogamous relationship doesn't mean you're boring now. Yeah, so we've addressed that shut that down real fast be honest. You should be some this relationship down real fast. You sure it's not like you're working really hard on it you're saying distance is not an issue. You're saying that you want to make this work you're setting us this question and yet you know, it sort of feels like the other guy doesn't really care. It's sort of like he isn't coming out even though he's telling you that he will and all this but I should say I've been in relationships where  Guys haven't been out and it's never really worked because you are in a different place in your life than them. It's so much. Let's say if you were in your mid-20s and you're someone who's out of University, you got a job, you know, you want to be with someone so you can start working towards one day buying a house and having kids whatever unless you date someone who's like still like going to raves on a Friday night and not coming back on. Monday doesn't really want to have like a real like concrete 9 to 5 job like is really like enjoying their youth and you want to be, you know, more like older inside and outside or whatever. The term would be  be you guys aren't a match and it's the same with this it sort of feels like you are ready to go forward in your life as an out guy and he isn't and that's not to say you need to like something push him to come out. You shouldn't like be like that. You just come out or else I'm dumping you. Yeah in cannot make that the issue, you know, if anything and they're always true because he wants to be an opal each of the easy way out is just say hey, I don't feel comfortable in an open relationship and you sort of want to be in one. So like either we tap out or we carry on it's just monogamous. But if we are carrying out his monogamous, I'd feel more comfortable if you came out, but I understand.  Want to and it also means that he's probably just not for you. There's someone else that who's out and ready and you're both on the same level both on the same track of life and you can go about your business together having a boyfriend actually did help me come out though, because I remember he had a six-pack and I remember feeling like, you know what I need people to know that I'm able to catch someone with a six-pack. I need them to know that I am like I am like enough of like a cutie to be able to bag some like that. So yeah, sometimes it helps. Sometimes it doesn't so our advice.  Us to you is we sort of have different ones, but the general Vibe is set them down. You said this isn't an issue so drive over there have a long convo and we would both say openly job is not for you. So definitely tap that out real fast and say if they really want to be with someone else maybe just call it off there. And then and if they do want to stay with you, it has been monogamous and let's work on finding out why you don't come out especially now when you're in dorms and you say you feel safer. If you would like to be a part of from the inbox with me and the lady who has plenty of life experience. You can share with you then.  Visit the SHINee Spears.com and send me your question girl. We want to answer it.  David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. Hey, I'm Sylvia cohill and my coming out story wasn't that glamorous? I am remember my mom asked me when we're driving if I like two boys and I obviously said no because it was very confronting and then later that day. My brother asked me but I felt more comfortable telling him. So I said, yes and he ended up telling my parents and then things kind of escalated and look for the next couple of years. I was only really loud to go to school barely saw my friends barely went out was  Just confined to home a lot of my you know, that took my phone my laptop and everything like that. So I didn't really have contact and everything's definitely calmed down a lot since I think they'll just shocked because of how young I was in their eyes, but my school helped me out a lot there they were it was a Catholic school, but it was surprising because all of the teachers and everyone they were really supportive of me and really helped me get through such a tough time in my life and because of that  Those are some that helped me out during that phase and it was super power by Beyond saying Frank Ocean, obviously because Frank Ocean was openly gay but it really made me gain some type of strength. So yeah, so that's that's it.  What a moving story. Thank you so much to one of my Tumblr followers Silvio at IDK Silvio on Instagram for probably doing that and we'll be sure to add that to the associated Spotify playlist as we told you last week on episode one something great about David's bobson bangers is that we get to curate it the lady and I guess had all our favorite songs. If you haven't listened to episode one go back because we do classify Bops. We do classify bangers the lady I want to hear your box and beans for this week. So my first one God bless his soul is a wreath of franklyn one step ahead. If you know your music very, well, you know that this song is Sam.  Old in most deaths Miss Fat buoy and then my second song is be our girl by teeger Moses. There is a really good catering are the remix to this that was released earlier this year and it was it bangs like it bangs all the way and then Plum by Troye Sivan from his new album sincerity is scary by The 1975 and lastly old age by masao. Go which comes from his newest album lady lady. I love seeing  that while bands or artists that have just started off really small and now they're like coming up with like Studio albums collaborating with so-and-so and the say goes one of them for me. It's really good to see him progress this this far and have more people discover him. It's his first studio album. He coined the term Traphouse Jazz, but this album is not trappy at all. If you're scared of trap it is basically like R&B with a bit of hip-hop with a bit of saxophone.  And it's inspired by women this album. So if you don't know get to know well my five songs begin with throw a fit by Tinashe. Okay, Tinashe deserves better. The lady does not agree, but throw a fit. Oh from literally 0.001 seconds in it slops. It is a banger. Okay. If you don't know get to notice the other ladies live our next song is from our guest who's coming on later on girly it is girl. I met on the internet. I  I love this song so much. It has a really fun kind of like Mario asked Abby it sort of reminds me of boys by Charli XCX except you came up before so I guess Charlie stole it from girly but next song is done by the four one one. I love the song This is a throwback to 2004 and I always used the instrumental being used in like commercials as much like shampoo ones or whatever and it's being sampled right now in a new song with the Monty Williams. So you need to check this out so you can hear the original and really Vibe with it. And if you do know me, you know, I love to dance. I love to get down the club.  Learn how to do more dances because basically everything after like the Yeah Yeah Yeah dance whatever you call that the shoe. Is that what it's called. I think so after that one. I don't know how to do any other dancers so need to learn some more but like when I first saw you went clubbing was 2015 and this song came out around then and I love it so much. It's by DJ. I love called CB it's a remix of stitches by Shawn Mendes. It's a bob. Lyrically. It slaps the remix. It's laughs. It's a slap. Okay, but the biggest song I have to really tell you guys about is good for you by Selena Gomez, you know last week we had  Older song I'm Coming Out by Diana Ross and this week. I want something more contemporary but it still has a really cool secret queer history behind it. So Justin tranter is the writer. He's done stuff like Sorry by Justin Bieber and he worked on bringing some but this song is one heated for Selena good for you and it's so cute and so good but I always heard it from Salinas perspective. I was thought about a girl talking to a guy but Justin actually wrote it from his perspective for Selena, but not too soon. It was about a relationship he had with a guy at the time, but I kept thinking was from slings.  Active because the big sign is put this to have this dress a mess on the floor and like all these lines but actually none of that was like written later on for Selena. It was he was in a relationship with the guy and the guy was like not the mood and they were having a fight and he just wanted me to find a silly way to like get him back in bed. So he found this like dress that they had like in their home and he actually lives with Charli XCX, I believe so maybe some of her dresses. Anyways, he puts the dress on and the guy just couldn't stop laughing and then they got back in bed, and he  Rip the drops dress off and threw it on the floor. I know and so our secret queer gay history song of the week is good for you as any Gomez, especially Love the remix with ASAP Rocky. So that's the one you're gonna see on our Spotify City playlist. David's pops and bangers all the Bob's and bangers on our playlist. You can stream our by either lgbtq Talent OR alleys of the community. You will not see a song on here by someone who's throwing around F slurs or is horrible to our community.  You listening to David's out for a good time Spotify original podcast. We are here with our incredible guest at girly. Hello. Okay, I have been such a fan of yours for so long. I think the first thing I've heard of yours was so you think you can fuck with me. Do ya my friend Rose Sheen who's friends with some of you are friends? Yeah showed it to me and so do I this bomb for ages? I'm not even like it sounds like an inside joke of I/O will go to all of her concerts ever go to like listen to every single song and then it turned into our reality. I  Yeah of all the shows you've done in London. I think we've missed one. We've gone to the Moon every other like the cookie shows my oh my God you going on tour soon, right? I am I'm playing Heaven in London and I'm playing in Edinborough leads Birmingham Southampton and brighten as well. So and your shows just aren't like normal shows. My favorite show you've done was that Electro works and you had a ball pit. I had a ball pit. But yeah never I think it gig is such an experience and like for me when I was  Unger armor when I went to my first gig and then I was just hooked I was addicted I just went to so many met so many friends through that and I just think it's such a moment where you just sort of can lose yourself and be whoever you want to be and like coming out of a giggle sweaty and exhilarated is one of my favorite feelings of us. When I started doing my own tours. I was like, oh my god. This is my chance to get the same, you know. Yeah, give people that experience. So I think for me I just always wanted to be more than just a gig. Yeah have like ball pits and crazy dancing and light shows and I wanted to feel like  You want coming to watch me play you are coming to join me for a fun night. You know exactly it doesn't just feel like a concert. It feels like a cross between performance art and a club night. That is my goal. Look poster tag light. Oh my God. Yeah Kelly club night meets performance art. Yeah, so definitely check out tickets for those like tour dates because you need to go see her. It's just incredible. It's just the funnest nights speaking of funnest night me and my friend machine that I mentioned earlier.  Earlier no night will be better than the night of your content Electro works. It was just the funnest thing because you have a song that is my favorite song that you've ever released called girl. I met on the internet. Uh-huh. And there's a lot in it where you go jump the gate to the close Park. Yeah. So after your show it was me you about ten of your friends who are also fun and Me & roisin decal McKenna one of his friends. Yeah. We all went to a park. Yeah, but the thing is me Declan his friend and Rashid and your friend.  We are all about two minutes behind you guys walking lies. Yeah, we finally got something where you are and it was a closed-off park for that night. It was like one of those private Gardens. Yeah surrounded by fancy houses. Yeah, very fancy houses. Like when we approach those almond outside our window young like get out of there. Yeah, so we approach and straightaway declan's friend hops over the friends like long job great over. Yeah, he comes over fun at all of you guys are already in there. I'm like such a pussy. I was like I can't do it. I can't do it again. And then she's like  Just do it and I see decal running off. I see you just in the sad fact like yeah, I have to get in. So I remember roisin goes to climb over Declan and his friend already there like waiting to like help her get over because she was wearing a really long skirt her like combat. Boot got stuck in the gate. She flips over skirt like over her head. Oh my God. I was no no not if you guys could see it being subtle. Yeah. I'm into this park that we're not supposed to be  I do remember that very well. The thing is when you play a show in London, you know, I grew up in London to all my friends come so it's like there's just this like pressure to just go out and party or do something and and usually I like take them back to my house. But I done that for a couple gigs, and it's always such a mess because you bring your friends back to your house and they make a massive mess and get way too drunk and then the next morning you have to get back in the tour van and then after the tour you get back to your house and it's messy from that party you had a couple weeks ago, so  I was like, okay, I'm going to bring everyone to a park but you know, I was a bit drunk and I was like, let's try this park and yeah, I remember the police arriving and everyone running away. I have never been so proud of myself. Okay, so siren wasn't going by member through these bushes seeing like blue light spinning remember turning to Ash and saying is that a and the girl makes me it was one of your friends. I didn't catch your name. She goes that's a cop car. I should have been a guy's cop car. Let's go. Uh, it was a mere no one.  After seeing it I was out of there. I remember meters about the first of the fence turning out about like maybe 35 Baht is all of you guys tried to run so fast, but yeah, but so most of us got over you were so drunk. We yeah whole you over the phone. Yeah. Okay David, let's go. You know, I've got a reputation. I was pretty drunk. I didn't have a show the next day just to clarify though. I was letting loose everything is the last show of October. I think was the last show the Toya and I I climbed over but then instead of just following you guys. I just decided  Added, let me just talk to these police officers and may God that we're not there for that. We were out of there. We're not getting arrested. So my head was like, you know what this will be fine. I'll just talk to them reason with them and did it end. Well, they weren't even doing it. They were literally oh my God, so I walked over and I'm like, hey officers. Nothing to see here that's been in the park and they were like, yeah, right and I was like, I just did a gig looking to them about like my music and they were just like the love for you though.  Italy with that to get us out of the park. They didn't realize they realized as soon as they pulled up and saw like 15 teenagers running. Yeah, they didn't have to actually do anything together. I peep your Instagram story all that shout out your Instagram for a second at girly music. You have the best Instagram story, but you're like, oh ways traveling like I see you in LA or in another part of the UK for at or something. Yeah. So how was I lay with like recording or what was yeah I go there a lot because I work with a lot of producers out there and make music out there. And I remember the first time I went was like  Maybe two years ago a year and a half ago and it was just too kind of, you know, just sent out for a week to work with some people see if anything clicks and it just really clicked. I found some people I love writing songs with and and so I go really regularly now and I think I write my best music out there. I think a big thing about going somewhere else to write songs for me and I think a lot of artists is that you detach yourself from the place where you were inspired to make them. So, you know, I live in London I get most of my  Inspiration from London at the moment and the people I meet here and those are my ideas come here in my bedroom on my guitar here. And then I take those ideas to LA and I make something they're kind of with less distraction in a way. Yeah, I think when you when I'm like in London and my phone is constantly going like hey, you want to meet up one day this one. Is it like wow there is if I'm in America, I can just be like no. I am across the other side of the world, you know the Escape. Yeah, very lucky and you like call people like from La like any like famous band member.  Well fuck right back off to La. Yeah. Well, I've been an artist like three years now and I feel like now I'm going through this massive period of change or like my new music and the stuff and coming out with I feel like they're so much more mature and so different to the old stuff like the songs you've mentioned like fuck right back off to LA. And so you think you're probably do I wrote those and I was like 17. Yeah, and I'm 20 now. I'm almost 21. So it's like so crazy to let you know when I when I hear those songs mention or when I play them live. I'm like wow this  Like I feel like I'm seeing someone else's song. Yeah, it's really you cringe a bit. Like do you feel like it's I don't cringe because I know that there are so many people who connected to those songs and loved those songs. And I think I would be doing a disservice to their experience of that music. If I sort of said, I hate that song, you know, because I know that a lot of people love that music that I put out but for me, I just I don't listen to it anymore, you know, because it's just kind of like for me it's like in a box like if stuff I've done and then now there's stuff I'm doing and so  we're not cutting it from the set list yet. Not yet. No, it's so fun live everyone puts their middle fingers up. Yeah who was not a cloutie person in your phone or like you could reach out to oh, um I chat with Kate Nashville or she's real cool. We've Dyke done just hung out and written a song before and like I've been to some of our shows and she's just like really cool because she's kind of like industry mom, like she's like really nice and gives me advice and stuff. And so she just killing it doing her own her own thing. She's  In so much in this and she's experienced some shit exactly. She's like been through it and she's like showing how you just do your thing. And she's yeah, she's sure your son who's like such a like I said, like I love your dreams be essentially a positive figure. But like when you have those bad days, I feel like you oftentimes do share like, I'm not having the best day like you're really honest with your fans and followers and the thing I really appreciate about you because you sort of normalize this like like a love Islander would never be like having the worst day ever. Oh, yeah, it's always perfect and with you you normal like you  Or my how you're feeling. Yeah makes them feel like it's normal to feel this way to totally I think it's so important because I think for me I realized that I wanted to do that with my social media. I wanted to be super honest because I was sick of seeing so much dishonesty and so much cover up these like fake lives like you scroll Instagram or go on any social media, but particularly Instagram and it's just like photos of people looking amazing and looking at like at their best every day and like, you know, you constantly compare yourself and I realized  No, I was going through a really tough time a couple years ago with my mental health and I just remember looking back now. I was posting things every day being like having a sick time like, oh my God great great and I remember sometimes I'd be crying posting that you know, and it got to the point where I worked on myself and I got a lot better and then I sort of actually I really want to share those experiences with people because I think it's really important a lot of the people who follow me in this into my music a like 14 15 the young and like  going through their own shit and sometimes it just really helps to know that someone else is going through that too and not feel alone and immediately it just got a good response. I noticed when I started talking about my issues with eating disorders and anxiety and general self-esteem and friendships and relationships. Just anything that people really responded to him like, well, I needed to hear that today. And so I thought yeah, actually I should just keep doing this and so it's kind of become like part of what I do. Really? I think I have a little  I'll go on my Instagram as well. I just talked about random stuff every week and it just kind of a therapeutic for me too. I think and that's really a mindset. I was in when I you know came up with a Spotify original podcast Davidson for good time. I wanted people to not feel like everything has to be perfect and you know the things we discussed, you know, we have good topics and bad topics. We have, you know, these interviews and people are really honest and it's because I want people to like feel comfortable and feel like they're not the only one out there that feels like this. So this being enter item here.  Yeah, yeah, totally so something that's what you think. So I'm not a musician. The lady's not a musician. We don't know the industry super well our awareness that history comes from you know, tweets or apartment raver. Oh, no, they didn't you know like yeah, so to me is I feel like you're in this newer generation where singles and streaming is such a big thing massive and so, you know, you've been around since 2015. What year did you get signed? 2015 was a mere. Yeah when I was seventeen which looking back I'm like wow, that was way too young.  But there's no album yet. It's been sick like single single single single. Yeah, all of them in my opinion to really I mean hot mess has 1.2 million like views on YouTube. Yeah. So like your shows do so. I like some people I know literally are still doing, you know opening shows and they're like these like I mean Camila Cabello was the opening act on a tour right now and that's like a big name. So what sort of if your mind me asking is stopping this album really coming to fruition think for me I signed when I was 17 and I was  aching music then and that is so different what I'm making now and I'm lucky because I signed with an indie label who wanted to develop me first if I'd signed to a major label. They probably would have made me release an album like a year in and I genuinely think it would have been the wrong time and the wrong kind of album because the way I look at it as I've had three years of development in the public eye, which usually artists don't have usually like you develop or you have a development deal you just  Work on what you want to sound like and then you release music for me. I was working on what I want to sound like and releasing it as I went and that's meant that actually it's taken me until now to really find who I am as an artist and that always of course keeps changing as you develop an in your career, but for me, I find now I'm like this is who I am like this is the kind of music. I want to be making like an album is like a body of work is like who you want to kind of be like, this is me and this is the general idea and  that just kind of has taken longer than other people for me to find and I'm okay with that. It's scary because it especially end with streaming Instagram and like the way things work now it's so fast. So yeah, like people kind of just pop out of nowhere and then like explode and like it's hard to kind of watch that happen and stick with your own journey and be like, okay, it's just happening and it'll be okay as you say that the I think when you  Do come out with an album. I think it's going to be really good because I'm a firm believer in like, you know, how like artist will release like one album year after year after year, but I think when Frank Ocean, for example, he took four years to release his second album and that was really good and it's that time and your experience and like whatever you're doing in your life all up to that point. It'll be worth the way I think. Yeah just for me. It was just about growing more as a person and you don't have to say  an exact thing you'd have to like release that much. But do you have in your head like a cut-off point where you think anything? I've released before X single like whatever single that maybe probably won't be on the arm, but then maybe you have anything recently think though that might make the cut if an arm comes out soon enough, honestly, I don't know I think definitely none of my songs from 2015-2016. Yeah will be on the album because there's such a such old versions of me really. I'm writing so much of the moment as well. Like I'm in such a creative flow. I'm writing so much music and like when you're just writing  Or you just there's more songs that come into the mix and more things you thinking about and you develop and your songwriting gets better as you know more your songwriting. So in Could Have you thought or it maybe you have have you written for other artists and you're like, oh, yeah that's coming out soon for someone else why I've done a couple sessions for other artists, but there's definitely a name for me. I think as soon as I get my own album out and you know get that project then I definitely want to start writing for other artists because I love song writing. That's my big passion. What do you think about that?  Vine that I mean Vines then we still mentioning Vines. What do you have? I know that bananas and avocados Vine. Yeah. Yeah, so people do you know it milady?  It's a parody of like are like Generation Z singers like Halsey Billy eilish. They have that same sort of an accent and you definitely have that I think maybe it's a person cuz I don't really like other artists that sort of have a similar not style but hasn't released pattern and have this age like Ray, for example, I guess yeah don't have that bananas on an avocado stuff, but there's a stuff annoy you about when we talk about the young see especially female. There's no bananas and avocados aperitif like Khalid who sings that same way, right? Yeah.  Yeah, do you like it's sort of like misogynistic this view that like especially often guys that tweet this about like bananas and avocados singers. I didn't realize the bananas and avocados thing was even if I should see it all the time all the time if it is interesting module Mass. I think this definitely different attitudes towards female artists the male artists. I think we just get a lot more shit to be honest. I think things are changing. I think it's the same for a gay artist and the same for artists of color. I think it's like  Lack of diversity and still like a distinct glass ceiling in a way for anyone who's not like a white sis, man, but but it's changing a lot and I think in mainly it's just artists being more outspoken and like involving political commentary and music and more. So I'm not straight but I am like a white cement. So I've sucked like these privileges that I'm aware of. What do you think people like me can do sure I think it is about everyone supporting each other and like being aware of your own privileges. I agree.  You know, like I had an interview the other day where I was talking about how well I identify as pansexual like, you know for who I'm attracted to so I'm attracted to everyone I'm not straight but at the same time, I think I have a more privileged than either a gay man or a gay woman because I'm attracted to both and in a way that gives me privileges because you know, for some people I appear straight, you know what I mean? So it's like and you know, same I'm a white woman, so I have privileges in that area and I think you just need to  Use your privilege to talk about things and meet people aware and you know, bring other artists up basically and support those communities. That's the way things are going to change because I think also when you demonize people if you say like straight people so cool. Well white people socket, you know, I mean, it's your like again like segregating and I think it's about everyone coming and that support that's I'm Katy Perry said on her witness worldwide like livestream things she did last year to promote her album. She was saying that when people would like yell at her like your problematic you do this you do this it upset her more than made her.  Want to be educated because she was never being told how to not only address it but fix it. She didn't want to be told you're racist or blah blah. Yeah, she wants me know you're racist because you do this this and this and here's why you shouldn't yeah and the things with Twitter's we have a character caption. So it is quite a Twitter based thing of people getting these short messages totally and I'm sure if it was like Facebook we would get like paragraphs of explaining but even then like are reading like I was doubt Katy Perry's gonna read an essay about explaining her mother. Yeah, but it's right. It's so important to educate  Self because like especially if you have a platform because like I've had situations where I say something in an interview that came out wrong and then people are just attacking me for it. And then actually, you know, I learned something about how I should phrase things or you know, that was really important for me to know so I don't make the mistake in the future same thing. I mean like the other day, I tweeted listening to cardi B, like cleaning my room and loads of people responded saying this is problematic and I was like shit I didn't tell me why. Thanks.  Of being like ignoring that and just being like the fun of me when it comes to problematic artist and who can support and who you can support. I always try to put them into two categories cardi B people consider problematic because of transphobic language. Basically, they they say she's done rieslings complete transfer things, but it's always feels like once incident of each and in the transphobic case. I remember people tweeting her explaining why and so that I'm so sorry. I understand now really like addressing it and there's not only been another incident since so for me, I think I can I can listen to Bow Tie killer or I like it.  I feel like yeah, she did bad things but she's learned to them for some like Azealia Banks. Let's say he who doesn't who people tell her why she did something wrong. She addresses that she knows it's wrong and then does it again? Yeah because it means it's the same with someone like Eminem versus I can only think of a male rapper that has something somewhere but let's say Kendrick Lamar know people talk about his past you can just you can have a bad past. It's about how you carry yourself today. Totally how you learn from it. Yeah, exactly. So speaking of girl power breaking the glass ceiling.  You know like songs like bang bang Lady Marmalade where they have multiplicate your record label comes to they say we're giving you a billion dollars to shoot a video and make a song. That's about breaking the glass ceiling girl power. Yeah. They want you plus three other female singers does matter what genre that be rappers. Pop vocal Indie who hold on? Okay. Tove Lo love my God. Hi aside from head to toe. Oh my God legit. Tove Lo is my icon only on sexy. What a legend.  Really, you know, I love a woman crush every day. Yeah. She doesn't give a fuck Tove Lo Madonna, probably just because I got clout that cloud just icon to be honest. Yeah. Oh, yeah Madonna cuz you know, the streaming would be really good because I love her probably scissor. We just made that noise.  We know you're listening. Okay, so you mentioned new music, but you're being very cool. You're not saying single tiles. So an album, I know it's like we discussed vaguely but do you have a title in your head that you like when it comes out? This is the title no idea really no idea honestly like because I'm about to go back to America and write a whole  Have new songs, the album that I think I'm about to make now could be completely different in a month. I'm not sure yet has your label ever been mad at your blinkers sabotaging Yourself by constant Perfection izing it like, you know, they've been really important really good. I think it's important. Like what's the label called p.m. RPM are oh, yeah, I've heard of them and that sounded so fake. No guys. Did I have I totally had um, and yeah, it's been really nice working with an indie label because I have more freedom to kind of grow and what did  Advice would you give to a young aspiring singer maybe not 17 because people can start at any age you can be 30 thing. Oh, yeah my music career today. Yeah, but what if I should give us on starting regardless of age just find out what you who you want to be and what you want to make and then just put it out and don't try be like anybody else and don't try make what you think people are going to like just make music and and record it. You have to record it in a studio just record it at home on a shitty Mike and logic of GarageBand.  And just put it online, you know and make it cheap video and play shows and just get people listening. Absolutely. So as I said my favorite song of yours of Alzheimer's grow. I met on the internet.

Hey everybody. This is how you are.  I just want to talk to you a little bit today about some happen to me the other day and they've asked me if I tell you about it just because it kind of changed my life. I think it'll change your life. It changed his life changed my aunts life changed everybody's life. So I was down at My Cousin Skeeter shop. But today I walked in there and I was trying to steal couple parts because my Ford ain't working right and Skeeter walk in he didn't know I was doing two skaters kind of stupid and he was like, hey bud. I got something I need to tell you want to take a seat right there.  Tie a seat right there. He said I want to tell you about something that I found out they if you haven't heard about it. I think it's wrapped right time. You did. He says it's called anchor and it's the easiest way imaginable to make podcast and I was like, well, that's like skater. All right. Well, I'm you got my you have my curiosity got my attention. But so he said well, let me talk to you about it. He said it's free. There's creation tools on it. They allow you to record.  Edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer and it will distribute your podcast for you. So it can be heard on Spotify on a podcast many other things many more many more platforms. You can make money from podcast no minimum listenership. It's everything you need to make podcast in one place.  And I started thinking about it and I ain't never heard Skeeter say none of these words before so obviously it took to him pretty well. It must be pretty important to him. So I just want to come on here and tell you that you should download anchor today and you know, just just do with it what you want to do man. Just just have a good time with it. My cousin skaters making a podcast now and he just is just having time with life with it. And you know, I keep stealing his Parts but he's making money from anchor and it kind of offsets it all so he can keep  Even and he can feed his kids and family and all that stuff right there. So it's a download anchor Today and and maybe maybe you can be you know the next Skeeter. I don't know.  Following total Atomic Annihilation the rebuilding of this great nation of ours may fall to you. That's why we here at fault boys WV will take you on an orator of the beautiful state of West Virginia. There's no other place to be better prepared for the impending fall out. Now we go live to our team of experts hello and welcome to yet another week with Vault boys WV a mutated podcast crossbreeding our shared history in Appalachia with a post-apocalyptic.  State and Fallout 76. I'm Your Country Road scholar Dave chaffins and joining me is the resident Fallout scribe Tom from Fallout lore cast. How you doing, Tom? Hey Dave. I'm so excited to be here. Thank you so much. I'm excited to have you tell me about tell me about what you're doing what you're up to what exactly is the fall or cast? So the fall or cast is a project of mine that I launched the beginning of January.  You know, I really wanted to get a get it out before the holidays. We're done. Yes. I was like, well I want to do a let's go back to the beginning. I was like, I you know what? I'm itching to do another kind of side project. I've got like a regular job and all that and hadn't done anything for about a year started a new job. Then I was like I should get some friends together and do a show about Fallout that would be so fun. And then all of my friends who are like interesting smart busy people were just too busy. So yeah, that's  Kind of how it goes and I was like, well, what can I do by myself? So I threw together this idea of like well some people touch on the lore and stuff every so often but there's not really anybody that's taking it like in bite-sized chunks from the beginning and just kind of going through and defining each piece of the lore As you move forward and kind of filling in the blanks, I guess for anybody who's starting the series later on kind of Justinian not from the beginning which you know a series of snow 20 something years old.  Got it. You got a lot a lot to learn, you know lot to catch up on. Yeah, so that was that was my thing. I was trying to get it out before the holidays because I was like, well the idea dawned on me just a few weeks before Christmas. I was like this would be fun I could do this and then you know, I didn't get out time. I was like I can get out maybe people will be getting the game for Christmas and the want to look up new podcasts. Nope. Nope. So I put it out in January and been cranking out the episodes trying to get them out there.  Doing really well you've gotten on I saw that you were on like the new and noteworthy or trending or something like that. Yeah. Yeah the iTunes new and noteworthy picked it up there. And yeah, it's well, I've got such a great response from people people really kind of put it out there and I was like, well, I hope people like this because it was just me like I was super nervous putting up the microphone the first day I was like, well, I don't have it's hard to do it in my opinion doing it alone. Yeah is very hard. There was one week.  I let's see Austin had something going on. I haven't booked anybody. I try to do it alone and I set there for five minutes and I was like, this is not the way this goes. Yeah, it's hard. It's like that first. You're like, well, how do I have a conversation with nobody and then you're like well, okay. Well, I'm technically having conversation with an audience and radio host of been doing this for a hundred years now, so years and years. Yeah, so there's there's got to be a way to do it. So I just kind of sat there nervously and then hit the record.  Button and start talking and went nope and then everything recorded and when nope and then rerecord and I was like, okay this seems okay and lo and behold I've got a show actually, I've got two shows ago. I started a yeah it started doing. Yeah, and so Elder Scrolls lore cast and yeah, I got like you got the whole you got everything on lockdown. Are you ready for you going to do like a doom lure cast and then you're going to run so, you know, I was thinking about I was  like if it's hard to do this stuff full-time because it's you know, like it's podcasting and you're going to get some audience but you know replacing your regular income is a very difficult thing to do, but you're not going to get you're not going to get that with podcasting whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to it's tough. But you know, there's the part of me that's like well if ever that were to happen or I was to move on to a different show. I would probably jump into some other there's there's so many game universes that are just  So cool and it create a leg. For example, you could do like The Witcher lure cast. Yeah, we did some guys I did I did a collab with they're called lure party. They do a lot of different they do different games, but they're Mainstay is Witcher. And so it's guys that and it's I think more along the lines of like what your show is where it's like very specific very focused on this one thing and that's maybe like two guys talking about the like, yeah very specific things.  The topic just dissecting that one thing they had me on and I like just started talking and they made it they had like the they had the one episode that was like the 15-minute like conversation and then they had a bonus episode was like 45 minutes of me rambling They just added you into a second show. Yes. That's great. You're like, well, we got this we got this guy on here. Well, to be honest that's that's where I started. That's what that's what I was hoping.  To do was it really? Okay. So the actual core idea came from a friend of mine who had moved out. So I'm over in Florida. You guys are open West Virginia a friend of mine moved. All here's here's the here's a tidbit for you Florida actually a part of Appalachia because of the geography of because of the way the plate tectonics worker some what's the word the Native American tribe outside of Tallahassee. Uh-huh.  Pull the chilean's. Oh, which is what the mountain ranges named after and that's technically we're that region begins is right above Tallahassee. Yes end up in the Panhandle. Yes in the Panhandle. I don't know why I said it like it's fancy to live up there or something. It's definitely not my brother lives up in the air. It's simply not fancy to live in fear. Awesome. Well, so anyway though friend of mine moved out to the West Coast a number of years ago, and he and his wife were coming back in town to visit and it was just one of  The things of like like, you know, when you get back together with a friend you haven't seen in years and you just like hit it off like nothing no time passed. Yeah, I know that exactly. Yeah and you're like, oh man. I wish I could have a reason to huh a reason to get together with a friend once a week and just have a conversation about something we enjoy together. What does that sound? Like? It sounds like a podcast. Let me guess. Yeah, but then it never really happened. So so I did my own thing. Yeah. Well, that's that's important. That's kind of how me and  Austin got started was we where I'd been friends for years and then really didn't see much of each other for four or five years and then he ended up like one minute. He was like, let's go out to dinner because he still lived in West Virginia and he was like, let's go out to dinner and then it was like happy thinking about I'm gonna get this job. I'm gonna maybe move out here. I was like, oh that's interesting and it was like a week later. He literally  we moved a block away from me. Oh, geez, he's back. Wow, it became a lot more simple to do all that. Yeah. So Tom, give me a little bit of background on where like Fallout what you what you think about it where you started with it. What was the first game? You played that history? I want to know like from the very beginning to where we are now. Yeah. Well, you know what? I wish I could say I started at Fallout 1, but  I was everybody wishes. They could be yeah that cool. You know, I know right late in the thing is that like I could have been that cool, but I think that was the year. I started college. So I'm a bit older than you guys and my priorities at the time where like, you know, like going to philosophy club and meeting all the girls like not not spending time in front of my computer so that I could actually like have a life away at  College and meet people and do stuff right? So I understand the only real game that I played a lot of in college was with Skyrim and that was because everybody that I lived with we literally were all in the the GameStop aligned at midnight for that release. Yeah. Yeah. We all had it was like everywhere on the TVs in the fraternity house already. It's all over the place. That's interesting. Yeah, we didn't so in the late 90s. You didn't even have good.  Ethernet on campus, right? It was all locked down with you couldn't even play Quake or Counter-Strike from one computer to another computer in the pin like another dorm building like it just it was terrible. So I was like, well, I'm not going to play any online game. So it's not much. Yeah, but that's interesting you bring up Skyrim. So the connection I guess you could say is if you if it's the Bethesda part of the Fallout stuff with like Fallout 3 and  It goes back to a curiosity about Morrowind and reading like video game magazines at the time because this was like the early 2000s right where magazines were still open, which is magazine and think of them. Yeah and then being fascinated with it and trying I don't know if I tried the demo or if I just was like a terrible human being and just like, you know downloaded it off of some share thing or I don't remember but I just totally LimeWire. Yeah, it was one of those velvet and I just  We bounced off the beginning of the game and was like, this is weird and I can't hit. I can't hit the squirrel in front of me with my sword what's going on? And then when Oblivion came out there was all the hype about it with the new consoles and and then I jumped into that and I was like, I was like, holy crap. I remember I remember specifically going to visit my parents and they were like what's new and I was like, well, I've been playing a video game which is a weird conversation to have like like what's going on in your life. Well, this video game is worth is notable.  It's worth bringing up. But you know, my dad was the kind of guy who got me into like the Lord of the Rings and had like an original copy of The Hobbit and like that kind of stuff. Mmm. And I remember telling him I was like, you know, this is the first game that I feel like I'm actually entering into a world where I'm just kind of lost in the world and lost in the Lord and I don't know what to expect around the next Corner because it's it doesn't follow necessarily all the fantasy tropes that you'd expect like when I when I first got vampirism  In Oblivion, I didn't even know vampires were thing. I know I came across some kind of vampire. He's not the guy. Yes. Yeah, like in a cave and I contracted some sort of blood disease but like once I started changing into a vampire and having weird dreams and stuff. I was like, wait a minute. I'm a vampire. What do I have to stay a bit? Is there a cure? Like what am I going to do? You know, it was like a real dilemma because it's weird if to figure this out. So yeah, I mean  Immediately. I became like Bethesda fan and then the announcement that Fallout 3 was coming out and I was like Fallout, huh? And I was like, you know, I never never really tried those out and there was like the big I don't know that big hubbub with the people that like the real Fallout fans who are like, how could you do fall out? It was a first person game and lovable of Bethesda is going to mess it up then let me hold it comes out and it's like awesome and everyone's like no this is really good. You guys nailed it and then  Vegas is like oh surprise. There's another one coming out just like really quick and then immediately almost yeah almost immediately. And so it's also happens to be by some of the same guys who worked on the originals and it's even more awesome and I was like what so yeah from that point on I was I was hooked. So I guess that's a long answer. I mean, hey, we're rambling. It's a podcast right? Well, no, it's a podcast man. Yeah. Yeah thought 3 is I think still a really really fantastic game.  Mmmmmm, you'd mentioned though that you had a first-year dad had a first edition of The Hobbit and it's funny because like that's how I was introduced to Fantasy worlds is my grandmother was an English teacher and she had a first edition. It was a paperback. It wasn't like a one-time copyright was the first edition paper back from like way back when she gave that to me and she was like for I think it was for maybe a holiday or something and gave it to me and she was like, here you go. Yeah, I fell in love with that and that whole  Fantasy in that Adventure setting like I had never experienced that before. Yeah as a kid. I was like I don't I guess there's a few different things that happen that make you realize that your parents are like interesting individuals rather than just your mom and your dad, you know, like the things that hint system similar to like these games this the things that hint at like a back story that's more interesting than the thing you just happen to see in front of you and I was like, huh? He's like, these are cool. He's really really likes these he has them on a shelf. I ended up inheriting  Parroting them and I remember being a kid in like Elementary School. I hated reading and it wasn't because it was hard it was because I just always felt like children's books were treating me like a child and you know that feeling you get when your kid, we're like adults talk down to you like you're a child and you know that that's what they're doing. Yeah, you reach that point where it's like, okay, this is annoying to me now, right? You're like just because I'm a kid doesn't mean you have to talk to me. Like I'm an idiot like just talk to me like I'm a person right and I felt like books were doing that until I decided to  The Hobbit fifth grade because I had to choose a book was like look like you're going to read a book this year pick a book. It's I was like I'll read The Hobbit and they were like, okay and that's got these like old timey words and it was raining like British English and right and it starts off with songs and stuff. We got their songs and poems and and it's it's just it's super dense, especially for you know a fifth grader and I was like, I don't know what the other is, but I want to go hither and thither you know, like that's cool.  So yeah, I completely grabbed me because it gave me the sense of like the unknown that write the full sum of the world was not within the pages of this book which write something. I've never experienced before especially as a child. You're like know the whole world is right here in this book. That's all there is. Nope now with that. So yeah, I like that that adventuring aspect and I think that's one of the better I think one of the better like as far as like a novel itself.  I think that's one of the better examples of like what the adventure in the hero's journey has and how how the story beats work and how they play out because like The Hobbit. I think The Hobbit is just in my personal opinion a better book than any of the Lord of the Rings books because it's just a little more cohesive across the board not to say that the Lord of the Rings aren't cohesive. But yeah, there's a there's a lot more descriptors and thus that it's like yeah, they're yeah, they're more of like a  tour of the world in some of the chapters. Yes. Yeah. I actually read and reread the Hobbit recently with my my eight-year-old son, and it's so it's so it's so interesting to read a book, you know, it's been a decade since I read it and it probably been in a decade before that. I wrote it before but to just get a you know, newer understanding of like what I'm reading through different eyes and it was super interesting to see like some of the things I didn't notice about the book for like the way that the  Jennings and the way that the end of the book the tone is completely different like in the beginning it starts off as I could Children's Fantasy and you have you know, the silliness of the door showing up at the door and like all of the you know, the it almost feels more like a cartoon and then by the end you're in this massive battle with Bloodshed and like real real like adult  topics, you know about like, you know bravery and honesty and being faithful to another person and holding a vow and like all of these right in teams and it's like it's like the similar to Bilbo's Journey in the story. He grows up throughout the story but the book also does to the way the book is written gets older. Hmm. It's I don't know. It was just one of those things that really stood out to me. I was like by the end of this is just is completely different thing. They really genuinely  From one place to another place which is amazing because I think that was kind of the idea. They're about yeah, I they're in back again Eric's you're exactly right. So it obviously like you both you and I have this like it seems like we both have this understanding that I probably like games that base their their story in their game play off of Adventure are probably some of our favorite games out there not go so far as to  to say that yeah. Yeah. I like I like when there's hidden depth with there's a venture when there's some sort of Journey, you know, I enjoy, you know lighter fare to it's fun to jump into you know, something like over watching, you know, cat people and get a few times and then log off but you know, like right the ones that really stay with me are those the deeper story like ones. So you've launched your podcast around the same time as a rather big Fallout game has come  Out and so I kind of wanted to get your impression of what what did you think of the announcement what you know, obviously something with that kind of probably influence you just start the podcast and so kind of want to get your impressions of announcement that the release and I kind of want to talk to you about if you've been playing it and what you're up to in it. Yeah, you know, I think it was nice to have a surprise back at what was it?  It was a e3 last year when that's when they do all their big announcements in there like surprise for coming out with a game again. Try like they did with Fallout 4, right and that was that was nice because I was like completely not expecting another Fallout game. I knew that star field was in the works. I knew that they were planning to do another Ellis girls eventually, but right, you know, everything had been kind of quiet about Fallout. So I was like, okay we figured that Fallout 4 was so like it was so big. I mean, yeah, it seemed like they put a lot of budget and a lot of marketing and a lot of different stuff at you.  You're okay. Well, they didn't do a Skyrim like to you know, right after they did Elder Scrolls, so they're probably just going to do for and move on right and it became very clear that it was like well then, you know, they're not Outsourcing something to bet that obsidian to do another New Vegas type second game. So we're probably not going to get much and then all of a sudden there's this announcement. They're like, hey, this is coming. It's going to be different. It's going to be multiplayer. So, you know be ready and I was like, that's great a my wife loves Fallout stuff.  To the point where I got her like the Fallout Loot Crate when it came out for like oh, yeah. That was a Christmas gift for the year. Basically whistling loot crate's all year Sly dog. Yeah, and you know some when the shirts didn't fit I got to inherit them. So that was nice to yeah easy trade off. Yeah. So so multiplayer like my wife and I can play Fallout together without having to just like pass the controller back and forth is great. So I got super excited about that and then the next  Next thing. I really the next notable thing was when they put out the announcement like the week or two before the beta test and they were like, hey, this isn't going to be perfect. There's going to be bugs. Just bear with us. Hmm and immediately. Everyone was like hmm. Well, uh, and you know you and I am sure we're like, well, yeah it does. It's a Bethesda game on the creation engine. Of course, it's going to have bugs like that's just I remember when the pit the DLC the  The pit released on fought for Fallout 3 and then everything turned into big yellow exclamation point so yeah feel like it's textures were missing. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, so I was like, no that's at the time. I was like, you know, this is probably smart of them. I work at a digital marketing firm and I remember bringing this up to some of my friends at the company. I was like, I was like, this is probably smart of them to get ahead of this, you know, but, you know game comes out. It's not what people expect.  It's kind of not fully baked and there was a whole lot of push back against that but I think what the in this is kind of I've talked about this on my show a little bit. I don't want to dwell on the negatives of these things because ultimately I'm not rooting for the company to fail. I'm not rooting for this to be a bad game. You course, even if yeah, even if a year from its even if it takes another year for the game to really get itself together and turn into what really should be. That's still a win. It's just a win a year from now.  Yeah, I think I think that there's a big like you're seeing like with Battle Royale these live service games are kind of you got destiny. You've got the division. You got Anthem, like you see these companies trying to try to stake their claim. I think that I think that people saw that and they said okay bethesda's out here staking our claim. We are Jenner in general displeased with the state of of how that development.  Works what that stuff is done. And then on top of that you have the normal bugs like literally the same bugs from Fallout 4. Yeah, they are and I think I think people like it got into that media cycle where it was like exciting to it was fun to be outraged at write this thing now anthem is out. So everybody can be outraged and yeah, I'm sure there's going to be something wrong with the division when it comes out and then they can all be mad at that. Like it's a part of a cycle and it's like it's like no man's sky.  And then in a year or two like they come back and they're like here's here's here's what we're doing in this new big update and then people catch on to that and they look back at the other stuff that they've done in previous updates and they're like, wait a second. This game might actually be worth my time now and then that's you know, because everybody likes an underdog in a Redemption story sure, you know, and I think I mentioned philosophy Club earlier. I was a philosophy major in school and college and I think I try to think of multiple steps in to every problem.  And one of the things I've noticed about this pattern of like the internet gets raged about something a little things move on or it's very similar to the problem of like comment spam or forums degrading into terrible stuff or the chat in a twitch Channel turning into just a mess of people writing stupid crap and you know flaming things right and I think I think the root of all of that is the internet gives everybody.  The same amount of voice and Because the Internet gives everybody the same amount of voice. The average age of the person using the internet is way lower than anything we assume so an incident it be mean to like younger people. But if younger people are anything like me and I was bored and 16 years old or 13 years old or whatever and I had access to the internet the way we did do today and gosh I base and all sorts of stupid crap because you know, I didn't care. I didn't know what I was doing.  I didn't think it really had any real effect on the world. And I think that's part of part of what we just don't really take into consideration is a lot of that negativity is driven by an audience that is just younger and responds to that because they're ink T kids who are just looking to be upset about something, you know, right and I think there's a lot of there's a lot of trend-following and they tend to I mean you see it and not to like, you know knock on the same like Fortnight door again.  You see that Trend work with like Battle Royale games. So if they go from this to that and then there's a whole like a meme in a cultural sense behind it. Like, you know, not just like like a funny little picture in it, but like a cultural mean by that that goes with with kids. I mean you see it from the kids that were playing Minecraft are planned for tonight now like you see that kind of like Dynamic change and and Booth through and  Right, right. Yeah when you have what do you get when you have that guy? I guess that kind of that kind of progression is as you go like they're already so engaged at this media. They already have stuff. They're seeing people put out their opinions that like it. It's been there on YouTube from day one, where as you know, I'm even from a generation where I grew up with dial-up internet, so we didn't like have like Adobe Flash Player worked maybe for like what we were looking at on Newgrounds to play flash games with  Right. Okay. Yeah, totally and so with this kind of like given a receipt culture like you when you grow up in a world where it's like common place to go to a YouTube video and put first writes a comment or like yeah, you're more open to voicing. I think your your your opinions boy freely on the internet. Yeah. Yeah, and I think a lot of it ties into that. So it's you just have to take it with a grain of salt and just kind of say well, okay, so there are those of us.  Who are of I won't say it's an age thing because there are definitely some teens who are more mature than that, but let's say so let's just say of a more mature mindset who are willing to say. All right. Well the company may miss some mistakes, you know, like the marketing department messed up a bit the company that the part of the Department of the company that does the bags messed up a bit, you know, it's fine. It's fine that they're going to make those mistakes. They're going to get like lash out from the community from the  Merce and they're going to have to change and if they don't they're that's just gonna get worse like everything everything either breaks or gets fixed. It's one or the other right? Yep. That's it. And so you go well, okay, let's give it time and see which one happens and my hope is that the things get fixed and the only way things get fixed is by calling out the bad stuff. But then also praising the good stuff and saying like you kind of have to have that and that's with any with any live game or active development.  But I mean if you're I mean it in the state, like if you were beta testing any kind of application, like there's got to be that give and take and that feedback and all that stuff. Yeah, so I guess to get back to more of your initial. Yeah. I want to hear your personal experience in Fallout something. Yeah. So I so I enjoy the good storyline stuff. I'm not particularly upset about not having it NPCs and like conversely.  Trees and things like that, but doesn't bother me too much about this one because one of the things that I've come to love the most about the Fallout series is the Environmental storytelling and the the idea of Novel and new things in each release. So, you know, like the things that we're in New Vegas that weren't in three, you know, like oh, where do these gecko things or what are these other guns that I didn't have before or these groups of Raiders that I'd never heard of, you know, and then 2 4 and going. Oh the  Power armor Works differently in this one. That's really cool or you know like oh, this is a different kind of laser rifle than I've seen before, you know like that that you know, the world looks different. This is interesting. So the fact that it's a much larger map full of more new content and really interesting environmental storytelling I think is a step in the right direction because that if they keep expanding on that stuff, I think that that's great because that's that's I like to just get  Austin the world can find a building and go what happened here, you know and then put the context clues together and go. Oh, you know, like that's what happened here. Okay, right. That's what interests me. Is that kind of like like in the future like that kind of like episodic structure that they're doing like with a roadmap and everything of like we're starting they're starting to trickle out these details in this information and we're going to get a little bit of that and then we're going to wonder about  About like oh this gives us a clue to this or that and then yeah, and for example in episode 2, they come out they're like, okay if we have this we have this and it's like, oh, okay that explains what I was thinking about earlier, right? Oh, this is what's going on in that Vault with the worshippers. Okay, that's what so that's what's going on with the weird tree red tree Vines. Like what's the actual core of that? We don't really know, you know, people are speculating, but we don't really know, you know and even  Even things like, you know, the scorched plague is kind of the main focus of the main story, but there's there's other stuff going on out there like the I just did an episode about super mutants the super mutants in this one come from The fev Strain that was shared with them from the Mariposa instance location, but they they're different these super moons are different than the ones in Fallout 4 from the ones and fall at one and two, you know, like one of the things that I thought was super interesting.  Once I actually dug into the research in Fallout 3, you know, how you come across those like Behemoth like giant super mutants. Yeah those this the story reason for that is that they're cell replication continues on as they age. So those ones are just older they just keep getting bigger the fact that there's behemoths in Appalachia is because there's something that goes wrong with the  Shannon and triggers an enlarging in size so the kind of opposites in a way one of them is the the mutation continuing in the on the right path. The other is some sort of trigger that breaks the way it's working and causes a change. So that's you know, who knows. Maybe that's something that's going to come up. I don't know but it creates like differences in each of the games and explains a little bit more which I think goes into the topic about like people getting all upset.  About like well, this is this breaks the Laurel. Ah, it's like well, no it it's a new place with other things that we're going on in a world. That's very big. That just hasn't been discussed yet. So give the people some room to develop content around a new place, you know, like right it's okay like it's not going to be like you're not going to have this minute the people I think at the beginning when they were talking about the brother like the revelation of the Brotherhood of Steel was there they were like, yeah the Brotherhood of Steel can't they didn't do the like  They went over there that early in the history of the games were over and it's like well, you know, there's there could be reasons why they were we just haven't seen you play the game and you learned I mean you you experience that storyline at me to you know, it makes sense. It's you kind of get even more background on the original Brotherhood which you I mean really only know between like, you know, like what people talk about in 1 2 and yeah tactics  and and three and four like you only get that background based on people that weren't there and this one you're like actually hearing the voices of these people for the first time. Yeah. Yeah, and what's really interesting is you could use I feel like people are upset because it happens earlier in the story from the games that they're more familiar with. So they're like, it feels like it's retro. What's the word retcon retconned. It feels like it's retconned in but had this been a follow that was that existed.  Years since the Great War and the same reason for there being the Brotherhood over there was that they were in communication with people over on the west coast and there was some relationship to the Brotherhood leader on the west coast through a connection and whatever they'd be completely fine with that. Yeah, and it's like it doesn't does it matter where it happens in the story line. Both things are new information that somebody had to invent because it's a video game, you know, like somebody had to write the application. Why can't we talk about the all the  like who designed the like all the Raiders look the same essentially, right? Yeah. They all have a very similar motive there all referred to as Raiders. It's like who came up with that? Yeah, the bottle caps. I mean, it's just there's it's a part of the Great like you're not going to make a Fallout game without some of the Mainstays like you're not going to have one without the Brotherhood of Steel because the Brotherhood of Steel power armor is essentially on every box art that shipped for the game ever. Sure totally. Yeah.  So there's certain I can't I cannot iconographic. I don't know words tonight. I can a graphic. Yeah, that's fine. I can a graphic details that have to get you know, like shared between the things in order to feel cohesive. Like it's part of the same world. But yeah, like that's a great question. Like why would two different two distinctly different communities on two separate thousands of miles away from each other both decide that they're going to use bottle crap bottle caps as a money Source. All right. I mean, it's silly. It's like the realistically  that's not going to work. Yeah, you know, yeah somewhere somebody's probably still using cash because it's not like you can't find old cash around you do my favorite Reddit thread I've read recently with somebody somebody said it posted and it was like a maybe it didn't have very many up votes, but it was like why can't the 10 millimeter submachine gun have a silence and somebody else commented and they were like listen man. I've got a 10 millimeter submachine gun, and there are no silencers for it. Like you just can't have a silencer for it. Like I've got one in real life.  I thought somebody comment back to them. They were like, okay, but do you have a laser rifle like this is not this is not a real. This is not a real world setting like nobody has nobody knows how laser rifles work or plasma rifles. Right? Right, right. Great. Well aliens in the real world are like this. It's like they don't have two glowing eyes when I met the Mothman. This is yeah. He didn't look exactly like a moth like he does in the game right and you can you can literally go to the Mothman Museum.  And see the quote the drawings of the people that have seen Mothman and they all look different, right? Yeah as with any Cryptid, it's all right to know subjective to the individual, right? Yeah and the culture at the time. Yeah, they'll man. Yeah, we this is funny because this has become like let's complain about people making saying dumb things about the game. Well, it's more it's more or less, you know, having the lore guy, you know what I would consider between between probably  At you and oxhorn as kind of the guys that are really contributing to the overall lure of a Fallout really breaking it down and making a consumable for you know, even for reminders for four people in the game that want to learn more or that are just now picking up a game or starting their first time. I expected that it was going to kind of devolve into that. That was yeah. Well, thank you next vacation in my brain. Yeah. Thank you for the I think oxhorn is great. I mean he clearly puts way.  More time into this stuff than I do and what Simon's of you know an inspiration for me. In fact, I think I even quote or mentioned some of his stuff in the second episode I do. So if anyone's listening right now, you should go if you really really really really want the Deep stuff like go go watch his playthroughs and stuff because they're so yeah, I mentioned it in the beginning of my show that I'm like, I'm I'm not the expert. I don't know everything, you know, like I've got my experiences in the games and I do research before you jump to ignore that.  Done my eyes and cross my T's but that does not mean that like in a moment's notice. I'm going to remember or know a thing or even have experienced it like I'm you know, very upfront about it. I started with Fallout 3. I didn't play one and two I've kind of you know monkeyed around in the beginnings of those games just see what they're like, but I had to watch replays, you know. Hmm. And yeah at this point those games are so dense and the technology feels so old to me that and I'm sure this is  gonna set some people off but I have I have a really hard time making myself go back and dealing with an interface from 20 years ago. It's tough. That's the hot that was hardest thing for me like because I they were released for free if you had pre-ordered fought 76 if you had a Bethesda account like and he bought it I think before the end of 2018 you can go back and play this and so I went back and it gave the first one to try it and I was like, okay I get it. I've heard the second one is better. I heard that they really  Like got in and the story is better. So I'm going to do that. Yeah, and I wouldn't play that and I got maybe I got to Vault City and I was like, okay, I understand. I'm with it. I said how this game works. I already know most of the story because I spent most of my time in Fallout 3 trying to figure out what was going on and look it up articles in the internet or something like that and try to figure out like the lore behind it. So I don't need that refresher, but I appreciate the  The classic style of all that yeah, right. Yes for sure. So, what's your what's your play style? So like you've been playing van somebody six? What's your play style? Like what kind of what kind of build of a character do you have for you? Kind of like a little bit of everything. Do you have a certain gun or weapon that you favor? How are you playing that? Yeah, that's a great question. So the first character I built I went my typical.  Out and I guess you could say it's like the stereotypical Bethesda route of like sneaky sniper kind of thing, you know, because everybody in Skyrim ends up going like sneaky assassin with a bow, right? So I'm like, that's the running joke. Yeah. Yeah some the following equivalent of that. So I've got my very early on when I realized that the super mutants and the scorched drop rifles and that you could break down the rifles and get the upgrades. I was like, oh, well, I'm going to build a sign.  Upper rifle and that's just all there is to it, you know, so, yep that became my first thing and I was like, okay, let's go with the perk cards that make me you know a ninja so either, you know from a distance or up close. I can still sneak up on things take him out really easily. So that's usually my go-to thing and strangely enough. There's such a predominance of power armor, especially for like leader game builds in this one that I carry with me. I bring it around just when I need it. But for most of the time I don't I don't use it and that one of these guys are ones are I like that  Almost like a like you don't think once you get the full power armor. You don't really need a hazmat suit anymore. Yeah, we're like for when I know that like something is happening. I'm gonna put this on that's I've been playing my second character has been sneaky. That's built and I'm I just maybe I'm at level 29 or something now, but when I got power armor, I was like okay for my other build. I don't like I use power armor the whole time and I've got like yeah a big Axe and I'm essentially like  Doom guy without the shotgun right? I run it things I hit them really hard and I walk but for this one it's different. So I understand the it's like is it really worth it? Because they got to do the whole animation to get into it and then you gotta yeah, it gradually decreases. It feels kind of cramped to even from just like a like an interface because you can see like the the screen the overlay changes the UI, you know it is  Just it even for any reason stomp ear and things and I just I'd rather sneak up on things and right mm and then they don't know I'm there and their heads pop off or whatever and then I'm like, all right. I'm good. Let's keep moving now. I get a lot of trouble because of that too and things around me. That's why I keep the power on around. So in a moment where I really needed its kind of my, you know, oh crap go to yeah, like okay, put it out get it quick Ok, good. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, but um, I created a second character and the second character.  You're not only one that didn't want to do different build, but I wanted to role play a character a little bit more in this kind of what I do with Skyrim years ago, like ice was about a little over now four and a half years ago. I really gave the whole twitch to like, let's see if I can get a channel up. Let's see if I can actually build an audience kind of thing going right and I spent about six months streaming six nights a week four to six hours every night in the evenings after a full time job, which was you know, just like, I'm sure  Lots of people have tried this and it was it was a lot of work, but it was I've done research on that because people of continually asked us if we if we do twitch if we do twitch do we do to it? Yeah, and I looked at it's like, you know, I've got you know, I've got a wife I've got dogs. It's like there's a kid in my future. Yeah. I've got other like I've got other Hobbies outside of this it is a grind to do that. It really is. Yeah, if you can't make it full time and do that as a job then it's  It better be fun and it better be the just the thing you'd rather be doing with your time because it takes a nap time. So so yeah, so one of the one of the things I had the most fun doing back in the day was role playing a character in Skyrim and the twitch viewers and I came up with rules that he had to play by like he was obviously a kleptomaniac because everybody in those games is a kleptomaniac but he was also afraid of horses so I couldn't fast travel and every time I came across a horse I had to go. Oh no, and they're like what the long way around that's funny and it couldn't get close to it. So  It's kind of like a DND aspect to that. You know, yeah. Yeah, and it was a lot of fun especially with the community that you know, watching and commenting and you know sharing ideas and in the character became more complex as things went on, you know, it would get these other ideas about. Oh, well clearly they would make this decision because that's the kind of person they are and so it would affect the way the story played out. So I decided you know, I've been streaming a little bit in the evenings this kind of, you know, kind of a way to help promote the podcast but more of  Of just having other people to play games with and like hang out. It's really less about like actually building a big community and trying to make any money off of it and more about just like, hey, it's fun. It's an opportunity hang out with some friends and chat with people while I play video games, right? All right, that's why I put up. I put out my PSN. I didn't do it at release because I figured then it feel like if people were listening to it like then everybody would add me and I'd have like, yeah this massive amount of friends or something.  So I did it like a month after release that way it's like okay if these people are still listening to this podcast and then they're going to be the ones that like, you know, there were thinking enter it for the long haul, you know, yeah, most of those guys that I play with it's it's like like full-time jobs have kids. Yeah everything which is kind of kind of nice because we're all kind of in the same in the same boat as far as time. Yeah has to be evening. So it's like you can log onto in the afternoon because you're like  what had I wish you two in the afternoon? What are you doing with your life? Like they have responsibilities and like a day job going on. Yeah. Yeah, I feel the same way. And so yeah, so the people I get to play with or just hang out with happens to be in the evenings when I got a few hours to you know, the kids in bed and I've done with all my stuff I need to do for the day. So my wife are just right. I just sitting around trying to you know, pass the time with playing games or watching a show or something. So why not hang out? So tell me about so tell me about your build this guy go.  For the second character. Yeah, so the second character all of that was to say I built a second character and I wanted to go in a different direction from the first one with the sneaky sniper thing. I wanted to go mostly melee and eventually get to the point where I'm using power armor lot and that kind of thing and stray away from Firearms as much as I could but then eventually I decided you know, I should at least have a go-to gun in a situation where I just need to hit things at a distance because Scorch Beast,  Are tough to hit with a with an axe all the time, you know that kind of thing. So I came up with Derek and decided I was going to role play this character and give him like personality reasons why he was who he is. So Derek is the quintessential like let's let's call him 13 year old kid who grew up with like helicopter parents who also didn't trust him with anything. He lived in a bubble.  In a literal bubble because he lived in our vault his so he's super naive about the world and then all of a sudden this isn't the way the game starts. Everyone's just gone right everyone left the Vault right and poor Derek gets left there and he's like, you know, let's say he's 20 now, right and he's like, I guess I should go out to the world and figure things out so he's like naive and optimistic. He's got he's not the most masculine dude in the world, but he just knows how to hit things because nobody's ever trained him and firearms.  So he can't even use a gun if he was to pick one up and he's got like like the little itty-bitty mustache because he needs to prove that he can grow facial hair just for his own like well-being and their ego emotional well-being and he's a good good clean boy, like he can't get past this idea of like the Wasteland is a dirty place and you're never going to get a shower. So every time he comes across so poor toilet paper. He has to pick it up. There you go. Now you're working it like that. Yeah. Yeah, so  There's all these like he's got these like personality quirks and then I got to a place where he came across his first laser laser rifle and Derek was like Whoa, man a laser rifle and so, of course he had to learn computer a laser rifle and he didn't blow his thumbs off so success so he can fit all sorts of trouble. He's super naive. He's way too trusting of people but you know that leads into these interesting situations. And so you've been playing him in your Twitch Channel. Yeah. Yeah. I've been streaming him.  He's kind of my go-to stream character because he's somebody that like people can make comments about or say he had like a connection. Yeah. Yeah, or like I'll see a situation. Oh guys. What would Derek do in the situation and sometimes they knew the character better than I do and they're like Derek would totally go in there and introduce himself. I was like, I'm like, yeah, you're right. He would even though I is the gamer know that that's a terrible idea. Derek will walk in and then I'll use the voice chat and go. Hey guys.  I'm Derek everybody just goes huh, like especially with other players, you know, they're like what and I came across two players one time and I was in like a rundown and I got in the house was like looking through stuff and then they showed up and this one guy this guy runs in and he goes he goes. Hey, hold on just wait right there. Wait right there. I'm just going to I'm going to drop some stuff in a bag. I'm not I'm not doing anything. Don't worry about I'm just going to drop some stuff. I got a lot of stuff.  If I'm going to I'm going to make your day because I was like a level 12 character at the time or something and I was like, okay, that's fine and he jumps up on top of like like a desk and I'm like your and he was like standing on a recipe and I'm like, um, you're going to get that recipe. I'll dirty I was about to pick it up and he's like what and I'm like never mind you want something to drink. I think I've got some stuff upstairs upstairs, but I start looking for like drinks and Derek doesn't drink alcohol. He doesn't do drugs and he's like well,  Yeah, he's good clean boy and I was like, the only thing I can find is some some whiskey, you know, he drink whiskey. There you go trying to host it as if he's in my house. Yeah, it was that's fine. Yeah, I think it's like the Situation's. Yeah, it's pretty good. So that's how I play Derek. That's my other build but he's primarily going to be like Melee power kind of well in the in the style of  Of what we're going through and going on so this next week. So this is I think Aaron on Wednesday, we are coming up on the first iteration of the new season with Fallout 76. Yeah. Yeah. And so this has been the first update is which came via inside the Vault through their roadmap and they kind of detailed a little bit more is now alcohol Brewing and Distilling  Has its own dedicated crafting bench and quests associated with that coming out. Yeah, so I'm very excited for that. Obviously is somebody who uses.  A like a my main character is power armor and strength and strength build and strength automatically correlates with your melee weapons and increases damage as you go through. Yeah, dude, I when you were talking earlier, this is a few months back, but about your your strength build with drinking and then cannibalizing bodies and how all that stuff that was great. It's like this so brilliant. I immediately went home and was like, I'm gonna be a cannibal with my main. I'm just hurt you. Yeah, it's all it's all about that.  Michael it's funny. It's funny to go through. You know, it's kind of like like I don't know that first playthrough was a lot a lot somebody to like the first time you play like a Souls game or like blood-borne or something like that. Yeah where it's like you don't know the system. It's like you don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what's viable. And so you kind of kind of have to improvise with it. Yeah, and I think that's what that's what makes the the Brilliance of that first playthrough with it is it's like, okay, you know with the stealth character. It's like I've got my  My Perks lined out of what level I'd get what I've got kind of everything played because I have a particular built in mind with that first one it was like learning everything and so it just what happens if I do this, oh that can connect to this thing. Okay, I guess I'll try it. Yeah, it started with with almost a blank slate and then like the character Itself by virtue of the universe became this like disgusting person. Yes. Yes, and that's part of what I want to do with Derek to is what he starts out as an optimist, but  Like the world just progressively gets darker and darker and he starts to Cave so maybe maybe with the distilling in the Brewing he like I think maybe he doesn't get into drinking it himself but he starts like making any pushing it on other people. I think that might be his next step in his evolution.  Maybe he'll Arena he like takes like one Sip and he's like hmm. Like yeah, like, you know, when you're when you're like maybe like that like 18 years. I don't know. What what sure sure great great when you're 18, you have like you're like on man. I'm gonna be real real badass and have a Corona. Yeah, or you have I'm so cool. Are you have your first sip of like actual hard liquor and you're like, oh, whoa.  That burns. Yep. Yeah, they're actually have to go through some some growing up. I think that's that's great. That's excellent. Well Tom, I want to thank you particularly for coming on and join in me. Yeah, you know, it's so much fun to sit down and have a conversation will have to do this again that now that now that we're all caught up and got everything together. So I had so one fine. I will only have one question for you because so  Okay, so I've been super exciting on the show and talk with you because I really like your show. First of all. Secondly you you guys are experts on West Virginia. And yes, that's tough. So the other thing that Derek is trying to figure out is you know, the song that they use the Take Me Home Country Roads in the in the ads. I'm not familiar with that song. What's so right, right. So there's the line in the song.  Where's it go Take Me Home Country Roads to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain Mama. Take me home. Right? Well Derek heard the song and was like, what's a Mountain Mama? So he's been on a quest to find his Mountain Mama and I'm just wondering if you have any insight into what might be Derek's Mountain Mama. Where should we go? Where should he go look for his mama. I mean, he's tried calling cuddling up.  It's super mutants. I didn't work. So great. I think that I've got an answer for this. So like historically like appalachia's a variant will get real a little bit full philosophical here Appalachia is a birthplace of culture. So I think that I think that the and there's research and there's a lot of different stuff that goes into this, but just not  The geology but the geography of the region creates culture that's very similar to why like yet people from Scotland and stuff settle here is because it was very like they were used to the geography they were yes to this and for the rocky hills the highlands of all that stuff, right? Yeah. And so when when they talk about Mountain Mama  II think it's almost more literal in the mountains since like the you know, it's the mat like, you know, I what mountain was I raised on a West Virginia. It was a mountain like that's the mountain is your mother. Right? Right. The the mountain is your mother and so for Derek, I would say that that maybe  His Mountain Mama is the mountain that Vault 76 is I think he's gonna go full circle. He's going to explore the whole map and then he's going to return home feeling defeated and then it's going to dominate him. That's my mama Murphy insight for that's great. That's great. Yeah, I think I think at some point his quest has to come back to the end man this point because my full circle like the frickin Hobbit. He's gonna have to like do his journey and then return home one day to the Vault right and standing in front of the Vault feels like  well, I didn't learn anything and then all the sudden it's going to Dawn on him and go. No, this is where I belong. This is my mouth while oh, that's brilliant. Well, that's what an enemy that's the whole idea of how they have had. They wrote. That song is the sky went was living outside and it was for Maryland as song about Maryland like the the descriptors and everything or similar to Maryland actually even like geographically similar to  Virginia proper, but then people from us to do hate that I say Virginia Pauper, but I was born in well, I was definitely born in West Virginia and I live in Virginia for like 18 years or 22 years. So anywho, he was writing it about coming home to a family reunions and like revisiting this place that he grew up in that hadn't been to in years. So that's kind of the idea and it's like and that's why it's so that's why you hear it at funerals is because these people like  like are religiously going home to to God. Yeah, you heard a lot of funerals to hear it a lot on on road trips at football games because everybody's there together. Like it's more of like your it's a song about family and and the region associate so got it Mayan site for Derek. Awesome. Awesome. Well, Derek will appreciate this. I'm gonna have to figure out how to how to put all this together on the stream. Maybe I should like just  You a whole YouTube series unlike the adventures of Derek. Yeah. Yes. I like that. That's excellent. Awesome. All right, cool. Well, thank you for answering my question my problem Tom Tom where can people find you out. I am on the Twitter at Fallout lore cast. I'm also you can also send me emails follower cast at gmail.com or if you want to hang out and experience some of the adventures of Derek. You're welcome to join me twitch.tv slash Fallout lower caste, which eventually I think going to just switch to  the radio because that's the that's the Greater brand with all the floor craft shows and we also have to do so at some point. I'm going to update it. But right now it's it's twitch.tv slash fall or cast. That was the original trappings for Vault boys WVU's because it's man that's pretty specific. And so I was like, can we do we need to change the brand? I thought you know what? No, you don't need to change the brain. I'd only I don't need to do that. It's like they're there everybody that's listening is familiar with thought 76 and if we want to talk about something else so we start  Can't Yeah, It's Tricky branding questions are tricky. Yeah, I'm sure working for digital marketing for you understand that. Yeah, I never think about it. Just like you've never heard that song. Yeah. Well, well Tom, I want to thank you again for coming on if you all are wondering about certain particulars about fall or if you're looking for information you want that that podcast form go check out fault lower caste.

We've got you covered six ways to Sunday.
You're listening to David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. I was doing but everybody can't say okay. Okay. No, I think I can save I don't know if I can say it each week. You'll hear from me David ocean that skip this shitty Spears.com and me the lady duvet the Superfund co-host.  And it was yesterday. No, I did not hide debate. Then don't have a date now. Yeah, yeah, exactly pot at the age of 16 and pied now, we'll be discussing everything young people should be talking about or are already talking about nothing is off limits or can be considered off-topic a Spotify original podcast. So I think the weirdest thing I ever saw happened this weekend, we both went to festivals your Festival however seemed to real time. It did not seem like that girl at parklife that fell into a urinal it seemed real chill, right?  Not crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the crowd for you could tell that the crowd was there for the music which was good. Hmm. I don't know if I can say the same the best one I went to was real messy boots. I've got three years in a row and each year. The crowd has gotten weirder and Messier. So my friend was dancing for Trinity the tuck Taylor from RuPaul's Drag Race who was performing on one of the like side stages and I also had artists pass so we both got to go backstage. So we spent some time in VIP where people can pay money for it was packed, but the only reason that we were really there was for the ba.  Bathrooms which were significantly nicer. So my friend is next to use the bathroom and as she goes in a girl walks out and people are crazy things to festivals, right? Absolutely. This girl was just wearing a really thin like it will for the summer. It wasn't that bad but really thin hoodie which isn't that weird for a festival now, what was weird is that right after my friend goes into that girl stall. She shuts the door, the girl looks in the mirror and then looks at all of us and goes I left my shorts in there. She then turns to my friend in the stall with the door. Shuts the chance.  Is like through this all saying I left my shorts in there. I can't find my shorts what the girl then turns and looks at everyone in line and all of us lift her oversized hoodie, which is probably stopping midway between her like waist and knee like thigh right thigh like yeah lifts it and her puss watches. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, ha. What? Wait what the girl that turns back to the stalled at my friend isn't and goes. I can't find my shorts and then walks down the steps and leave.  Eve's shut up. So she doesn't even go back for them unless you flush them they weren't there. So we're thinking how the fuck did this girl go through the line to the stall lose her shorts have her pulse watch out and not notice. Oh my God. Oh my God later in this episode. We'll be doing a special viewer response segment where we're going to go through all your comments and just answer some of the things you want to do and FAQ if you will and also a wise  Very special music segment where the lady dies choices are going to be judged by none other than previous guests will Young.  You know what? There are so many new rappers on the scene. I feel like there's a new rapper every other week, but I really struggle with starting to like become a fan of any of them because I really want to get into Megan be stallion. But every time I start to like a rapper, they get clowned or into clownery Azealia Banks clown Iggy Azalea clownery cardi B both so I'm struggling here you like my style, you know. Yeah, I love her. Well, did you see her latest Instagram post where she said? Hey hotties. I'm having the first-ever hottie Beach Cleanup in Cali June.  Except the Santa Monica Pier be there 3 p.m. Houston were next. I haven't seen the quote but I have seen the video. The thing that I really like about her is that I've gotten to any of her music you've helped her up. I've seen other people hyper up, but she just seems like someone who genuinely does care about using their platform for really cool things and like we've talked about other celebrities who've done that in the past. That's not she's the first ever but I will say like in the RAP Community. There are a lot of causes that got a lot of focus, you know bringing people out of poverty stopping gun crime, but something like  Nobility and global warming. I don't really hear that often even from pop stars really so it's really nice to see her take advantage of this. Yeah. I feel like big people don't actually do enough. I feel like it's within limits and that's where this story comes in. So we see someone like Mega the stallion making this beach cleanup of Santa Monica pier and the beach below it, but she said she would turn up at 3 p.m. She turned up to five PM fans already been there from 3 p.m. And by the time she arrived according to them they had already cleaned up the beach we've seen videos we've seen photos. They're easy to find.  Where the trash bags where is the receipts? Well, where is the evidence? It did not look like they did shit Hall when they were there Santa Monica beach is like the number-one tourism Beach. Like when I went there it was on like a really cloudy day and it was packed its costly clean. It's like going to see Big Ben or Trafalgar Square. Like they will constantly be doing an effort to clean it up because they know it's the most popular. So some people are saying she didn't pick the best beach for a cleanup in general. But by the time she arrived there wasn't really much to clean up and she seemed to be the only one actually doing anything. She was only one of the trash.  Along with like some for Entourage and she had a bottle of Hennessy with her and then a bottle to kill her friends hand and they were just giving everyone shot and saying like one of her famous quotes. Let's ride the boat and it was just like it was sad to see because clearly she had such good intentions, but like all the energy of taking selfies with fans and pouring Hennessy down their mouth for cute video is nice and all but you said you were there for a beach cleanup, but you seem to be the only one doing a beach cleanup and as well. I feel like it's always sus to use your word when  You bring like your entourage with you like people to so she needs security did you see how close those fans are getting a security but I wouldn't say you need like people there to take photos or like I don't know. I just think like anything press related you don't need to do I think you can do good things without needing attention from it. So someone like Megan the stallion saying let's have Beach cleanup has a massive audience and clearly had massive turnout. But how many people are there for the beach cleanup and how many people are there to get a selfie with Megan then if you think of let's  Just your average Joe or even like an environmentalist blogger where their fans are clearly following them for a different reason if they say let's do Beach clean up the people that turn up might actually be there for Beach cleanup people go for the cloud, you know, but also you will chase is everywhere but you've also got people that actually care about the environment and it's that I feel like it's always people who aren't big and famous that care way more and actually do the most and it's actually them that get the least amount of attention as well. Do you believe her fans? I'd like to be honest like this is  not really that related to the story sorry listeners, but I do think it's interesting do believe her fans that because she turned up two hours late. The beach was ready clean and they did everything. I just want to look where the receipts where were the photos. I don't know the first opera if you like, there's like three pictures and to answer your question. I feel like you said that the beach is almost always clean. So I'm guessing there was fuck all too clean to be honest. But what would have been good to see was a picture of the beach before the cleanup and a picture of the beach afterwards and see what the difference was.  And she probably could have picked a better Beach. I know why should he take his body one of the most famous speeches in LA, but she was always like Houston your next she's proud of Houston. Whatever may be made more sense to start somewhere, you know, especially from firsthand experience could use some support and help instead of like the number one tourist spot that gets constant support anyways from like actually like government paid cleaners and it can go like crazy off the deep end sometimes on the internet. I know everyone has these important causes and education. They want to share with everyone like Megan sustainability.  There was this beauty blogger not massive only like two thousand Twitter followers, but she was talking about these like all natural birth control and remedies including fig root and yams and it was crazy that some people were falling for it. I mean, yeah, most of the millions of people that were engaging with the post and retweeting and sharing it were making fun of her like but there's probably someone out there that is going to believe it and fall for it and it's crazy that some people on the internet even with only 2,000 followers have this power Twitter educated or Twitter education where people literally  Lee read everything that they see on Twitter and sounds like you believe it I never believed that bullshit. Do you really think yams yums are an effective birth control? No, no way in hell and the fact that she's not even a doctor or has any sort of like medical background. I don't know I think maybe we're going too far off the deep end. I don't think you should believe everything you see online. What do you guys think visit the city streets.com and let us know we read through these answers a lot and sometimes we feel maybe not Twitter educated but listener educated.  Certify original podcast this week from the inbox is kind of a tricky question. You know, you guys sent us a lot of things on total opposite ends of the spectrum sometimes really easy questions. Sometimes really difficult ones, but we go through all of them and try to find thing that could maybe apply to as many of you as possible. You know, we look at questions from all over the world. And this time we found a listener from a very small town America who sent us a really good question because they really want to know about our personal experiences. Like we say, we're not experts we just know from our own lives and our own stories what we can tell you, you know in a fun friends.  Kiki kind of way, so that's exactly what we're going to do this time. Let's go into it the advice question begins. I recently saw those disgusting hate crime that occurred in London and this summer I girlfriend and I were planning to go in Brackets along with three other friends all straight and brackets as part of our Gap your through Europe, but my parents no longer want me going because in their words, they can't protect me when I'm abroad. I know you've discussed traveling abroad while gay on the podcast before so I was hoping I could maybe specifically talk about your experiences in London. Okay, my friends the ones from London actually have an experience.  Anything too crazy and they lived here the whole life. Maybe they might get like the odds F bomb thrown here and there but as far as like violence, it's been pretty sweet. Pretty sweet Vice a pretty sweet apart from you know, yeah same I think in my experience, I've never had anything. I've never even had physical like threats happen towards me. I know one friend in my entire like almost a decade now of living in London or around  In that has had anything happen to them physically and I think one person in 10 years, like I know it's sad to say but like you probably have a greater risk of getting hit by a car while crossing the street did I mean and that's all I can happen anywhere. I don't know where you are exactly in America and you know you sort of implied was a HomeTown in the like larger brief of your question, but something just as bad can happen in America that can happen in London. I think sometimes and I only recently acknowledged this was I saw a post talking about terrorism in France and was like, why about you need to be extra careful when you go there but like terrorism can happen anywhere.  Same with anything a plane crash a fire not to make you feel like the world is scary. But sometimes the risks you hear about foreign countries can just as likely happen on your own street sign that something to tell your parents that you know, yes this crazy thing did happen, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen to me and anything that could happen to me there could just as likely happen to me here and as well cause y'all visiting when you visit a country your you literally see the best parts of it. I don't think you ever off the Beaten Track. Yeah like you I don't think you ever experienced feet like the full  like social atmosphere of a country unless you live there so you will probably have a good time. I think you should come with an open mind, but just be vigilant know that you're not in a environment that you know inside out like a local like in the lady was saying and you just need to be careful, but no more careful than you might be in your own City Anything Could Happen anywhere, but that should be reason you shouldn't visit and explore and be stuck in your room all day. But if you have a question similar or different as one no more make sure to position these beers not calm and let us know what you want us to answer.  Hi, I'm Thom and when I was like 14, I came out to one of my best friends and I just said like listen, you know, I think I might like boys and girls at the same time and to my surprise. She just goes like yeah, that's fine. Did you not know that? I'm bisexual to and I was like, oh really and that's just it was kind of easy to just talk to you about it and it wasn't really that much of a big deal which was a huge relief to me and ever since then like I catch myself coming out to people all the time now and just  You know mention it and it's not that much of a big deal now and I think that just because I felt so at ease with my friend at the time that ever since then it just feels easier for me to talk to people about it and the song I like to add to the playlist is abstract by little Halima.  Now it's time for David's bobson bangers. Now, we've got a special guest joining us for this bobson Banger session to introduce yourself for the surprise listeners it hello. I'm William William William because I got called Will Young because I was on a show called pop Idols talent show and they changed my name to will halfway through so you applied with William. I've yeah William young. So the next time should be William singular just like Madonna Cher. Yes, just William. Yeah anybody mmm. They take over that.  Yeah, I do not know exactly because know you can't really name your kid my daughter share anymore at this point. You can't there's not there's no law of but it's questionable fringes like people calling that children after Game of Thrones characters know like do they? Yeah, like you've come. Yeah. Well for this pops and bangers I  We should do some pride inspired tracks both by our favorite allies and lgbtq artists and just songs that maybe you know put us in that Spirit when it's a month of a lot of events at a lot of going out and a lot of maybe staying in if that's your Vibe but this music was just like help you get through it. So now the ladies are going to share our five tracks and then you're gonna decide which is better. Oh, okay. Oh no, who's attract mist is better. Yeah. I've got one per one like one group around might their definite like, well not definite like they just don't fit the  Problem feel that's how you boo-boo? Okay. Okay. We'll keep going with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Look you guys my first song is plot twist by Marquis Bassy featuring Kyle. It's a new song is really nice. And then doing Time by Lana Del Rey who me and David are gonna see at Latitude when we perform there and then I've got you and me by Disclosure featuring Eliza Doolittle, then I'll start by Smashmouth which you know is an absolute tune and then lastly Shoop by salt and pepper.  / Oh Yeah, you sort of saved it with that last one was lost for the first for my tracks begin with new Americana by Halsey Mighty Love by RuPaul come into my world by Kylie Minogue vroom vroom by Charli XCX small-town Boy by Bronski Beat, oh God obviously his has more valuable, you know, I kind of followed the theme oh my God, okay, so can I tell you where I'm at yeah Lana Del Rey and Shoop, huh? We slightly doing it for me.  Yeah soup at the end. Yeah, because that's quite a personal favorite of mine. Yeah being a 90s R&B man small-town boy is one of my favorite songs of all time. So I think I'm slightly swayed by that. I know so you were one one now because when Bebe rexha came in she picked the lady for that goal Girl Power for now, you know, I'm bringing it back we're tied now you no longer have that power over me, but it's not better or worse. I've just gone.  With that one favorite. Yeah favorites, but we want to know more about your track. So when it comes to your own discography is any track that really pops out for pride month for me my songs. Well, actually, I think I'm pleased I can say this and it's not just because I want to plug a record, but I got a new song called my love and I like the sentiment of that actually really like the title my love. I think it's very appropriate for Pride. Not that I thought it would come out at Pride so  I choose that one and then I choose an older song of mine called jealousy, which is a really good. Oh, no. No, I'm going to change my mind. I don't I don't know. I'm going to choose a Groove Armada song, which I did with them called history, which is inspired by small town boy. Yeah Lincoln we support those choices and you can find them on Davis pops and bangers are Spotify Associated playlist.  David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast. So it's time for our listener response special. So we've gone through because we get hacker comments not hella comments hecka comments and you know, they're not just you know, right for the device segment for we want to go through the many ways, right? Yeah, let's do this. So I'm going to start with the first ones I think is one of the funnest ones so John asked us what are our plans for the live shows. So if you don't know because it's not like we've been, you know ranting about it posting about it talking about it Non-Stop.  Yeah, absolutely. We're on both the lineups for reading and Leeds which is a joint Festival. If you don't know get to know and latitude Festival latitude Festival is this July and reading and Leeds is end of August. The lineups are sick outside of us, like obviously, you know, we're doing the best but everyone else is great to who you most excited to see from what we're going to I think I'm excited to see Lana Del Rey and commandment and who are you looking forward to seeing I think obviously we both were both gonna say Lana, but we mean it we  I mean that we have been dying to see her for so long. But yeah, so our plans for the live show very a touch, you know, our dreams are as big as bait shella, but I don't know if we've got the budget. Yeah, I think she keep it a secret. I should be spill one thing. Yeah spilled one thing. Okay, we may be doing some choreography. There's a plan for that. I'm not gonna give any more but it's pretty obvious. We think of the segments of the show. Okay. So our next question is who has been your favorite guest this year.  he's a  I would have to say probably William like absolutely will young and he's just so honest and unapologetically him and I really enjoyed the conversation that we had inside and outside of the studio. He's just an interesting person and I really admire the fact that he takes a lot of interest in other people as well. Who was your favorite guest I'm gonna say it's a two-way tie. Yeah.  Tween Felix because he's like one of the first guests that came in and was like super on it and the other side has to be because she's been on both seasons now, so we just have to like keep a nice as she rooted for you during your exams. Yeah. She's such a sweetheart man. She's actually such a sweetheart. So our next question is kind of a follow-up and it's from Alice saying what would our Dream guest be? Oh, that's your thing. What not who so in my head. I feel like we need to pay.  Pick a tight like we've not really had that many actors on. Yeah, I think yeah, absolutely. You've wanted a partition for a while music. You know what I've only won one person who is related to politics but not quite a politician. He's called Owen Jones. He's if you're in the UK, you'll know who he is. But if you're from outside the UK is basically a journalist and spectator on most things that happen politically in the UK and he's just got such a loudmouth and I love it and he's he's written  Very interesting books one of them that I've only read and it would have been fun to have him on here like a politician might be fun. But I think it's one of those things of you never know what they're gonna say and we don't get in any trouble. But the thing is I think the I think the most criticism that he gets is the fact that he speaks up a lot for the working class but acts as if that the working class don't do anything bad. That's the best criticism. I've I've had bad him and I think I don't know I wouldn't mind debating with him. You know, I think I'd have a lot to fire back to  We have another question from Joshua who has asked has there ever been any topic you wish you could cover but couldn't for whatever reason. I feel like there's not more like a scandals answers like no one's ever been like you can't talk about this. I feel like when we don't talk about things, I think it's because like it's to in the moment and not something that can that can be listen to it. Anytime has there been any topic that like in retrospect and you've seen how long it's gone on for because like our first episode  We talked about the college like recruit Scandal and that's still going on now. So is there any topic that you didn't cover because you thought I was too in the moment and actually what do you sense? I think maybe it's because I've related to love Island when we when we talked about it, but it's like beauty standards within TV and within TV and films and just in general, you know, and and just seeing how like certain features certain skin colors are just preferred over other skin colors and features, but I I related it.  Way too much to live Island. But if you watch the violent, you definitely know what I'm talking about. It's a good example. Yeah it is it is so I feel like maybe next season and I bring it up in a more eloquent matter. Yeah, exactly and you you know, we kind of covered it but the thing is like the time we talked about James Charles transphobia Scandal the episode went up on Tuesday and on the Friday. So the day after you recorded it was when the whole like makeup Guru like Scandal thing happen.  And actual topic that we discussed James Charles and wasn't just the transphobia element but also about YouTubers apologizing and how it happens repeatedly and the criticism so like that topic the next day would have made just much sensors. So funny that we talk about a scandal that in retrospect was significantly smaller than everything that followed the next day Henry / Harry. I like that a nickname was included has asked us about the weirdest or funniest advice question we've had and not used I feel like if it's funny we have it on.  Anyway stuff like that was just fun to tackle. I can't remember anything. Can you I do remember we did get one question. We actually did start recording it. But then we tapped out we have to bang on that day violently next question. It was that the person was getting like too deep with like names and actually we're going to censor use fake names but like their situation was so specific to them that even though it's funny and raunchy and risky to read it was like, oh if someone's listening  Them that was so much going on in that the sea was scalding the table. I literally if any like you in their circles. Yeah, you know how this how you know some authors have written books about like fictional lives and then some random person somewhere has been I actually that's my life. I feel like that that would have been the situation with that and it was like relationship drama, but it wasn't like, oh I'm seeing some and this is me like ad-libbing. The question is not what it was but it wasn't like, oh I'm seeing someone.  One and it's not going well and I think about cheating blah blah. It was like so I'm seeing someone and this is their name and this is where we live and I've seen their friend who goes to this class at that and it's like such specific details. I was like you may as well just tell the right now to their face don't ask us if you want us to answer any of your advice questions, please please please head over to the shit new spheres. Don't calm we go through all of them and even if maybe there to scandals for us to read out we can at least laugh and enjoy the fact that  One out there is struggling as much as us. We have another question now from Rachel who was asked what podcasts are you listening to? So we've had quite a few people come in who have their own podcasts? Well, I'm has raised Chaser David dobrik has views Will Young with his podcast and Ira Madison third who was from our first season. He has one called keep it. Yeah, that's a good title. Yes, but you could snatch that. Yeah, but yeah, so we like to you know, hype up other.  Podcasts all the time who's on that maybe we've not brought on as a guest, but you would love to shout out George Ezra his podcast is good. Yeah, I really really really like his punk ass particularly. The episode that I listened to recently was the Elton John one which was it was just really good and interesting to hear and deckle mechanic who's been on our show. Also the George's just listen to both and think it's pretty obvious who did better just say do you pick him as well? I have you got a different one. I think my favorite at the minute is  I just started and the annoying thing is is I'm not going to say what the other podcast they were on because it's a pretty like I think they're having beef at the minute but there was these two comedians. I had a podcast together that was really good but they've not done an episode about now have two separate podcasts on I know with two other friends now, but one of them actually started at the same time at the podcast that is beefing at the minute and that one is called Lost culture East us, I believe and that is with bow and yang who is right on SNL.  And also Matt Rogers who's a comedian and rights for like vulture and other magazines and is it because like we think we have no filter. They have no filter the stories. I hear I'm always like if I'm on public transport, I'm like, please don't disconnect are pods. Please don't disconnect their pods. Please don't disconnect their pods. Maybe I make this part a little bit quieter like they go deep on stories and also the receipts. I I've been listening to them for a while now, I love them. I love it a girly group talking.  Boys talking about live talking about being broke. I love it and I reminds me of my own friendship group. If you want to send to your own comments in send them in not everything has to be a device or a colleague come out. We want to just know what you think about the podcast in general what you think about, you know, the ladies behavior and some of our introduction stories some of my behavior, which is questionable. Just message us Business Interiors not calm or visit my lady at at sleeping with Milady on Instagram and at maybe the lady on Twitter and you can find  David at at written by David on Twitter or at David Alternet ski on Instagram. Thank you so much for listening. Bye David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast.
You listen to another episode of BJJ psychologist. And I'm your host. Dr. Yasi Pujols. I'm a clinical psychologist and Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. And today is Monday, June 24th, 2019. The topic today is knowing when you are too fatigued to tired to train now. There's this idea that you Train when you're tired you train when you're hungry you train when you're hurting but maybe sometimes you train when you're injured and sick but knowing when you really need to take a break and rest. So if your training several times a week or several times a day, sometimes we lack the time to restore a bodies to properly train and of course that can lead to it.  Issues like lowered immune response and injuries sprains strains things like that.  so understanding how much rest you've had between training sessions even if it's during the day between a morning and an evening session or from one day to the next calculating how much rest you've had can be difficult because we often times in our busy hectic lives push through even though we're sleep fatigued and sometimes our training sessions can eat into  Usha sleep hours so understanding how much rest you need how much rest you've had is a good indicator of whether or not you should be training at that particular moment. So the default is I think for most serious Jesus practitioners is to just keep training as much as you can and then take that rest when you've pushed your body to the Limit now, that's a  Method but over time your party starts to take the take on that toll of being quicker to be fatigued and depleted. Of course. We're also talking about food so sustenance in order to fuel your body to sustain so many hours of training.  So going back to looking at your sleep pattern that's very important. And then also stress level during the day. How much are you taking onder de is your day filled with work or school or caregiving? I mean, we all come from all different walks of life. So we have different Lifestyles and depending on how stressful your your personal life. Maybe can impact.  Act that mental drain and then if you're feeling that maybe you're too stressed out to train, that's probably true and then pair that with the Sleep difficulties or lack of sleep. It's just kind of a recipe to to show up to class and have maybe not the greatest training session. So the perfect storm coming together to maybe not  not  You're not able to have your best performance. So and of course that's just one training session and one way to look at it is like hey, I just I showed up and I'm not feeling a hundred percent. But at least I'm here so you can lower your expectation. If you're kind of dragging and fatigued going into class and just know that showing up was the primary goal. So that's one way to offset. Not not overwhelm yourself with also having to perform well in class just kind of  Make the your goals for the class reasonable and then hopefully catch up on rest and restoration afterwards. So knowing when that cutoff point to actually not go to class is very important. I think many of us just surpassed that we just kind of keep going like, you know, what I can do this I can get through this and the truth is you can but what's the cost? Are you going to be dragging the next day? Are you going to fall in?  Lll are you going to sprain something because you're just kind of too tired not paying attention or not sharp. It's all possible. So is it better to hang back and do something different during that particular training session might be but you have to become aware recognize when when you're too tired when you're to drained to show up to class. So just for a review.  Consider evaluating how much rest you've had how stressed out you feel and then you can see okay, is this a training session where I can show up and and have a good time and get some work in or am I just dragging too much to even properly participate in the way. I want to so checking in with your self regulating our how many hours of sleep you've had. What food you had for the day and how you're  Ealing on an emotional level. So I think those are kind of good points to consider when you're deciding if you're going to actually go through with class or not. And then if you don't don't beat yourself up with guilt, which we can also do you know my gosh I didn't go that one training session. I feel so horrible. How am I going to make it up? If this sounds familiar to you? Guess what there will always be another training session you could go at any  And you can even get some side work in, you know meet up with a friend and drill stuff. So there's many ways to get your time on the mats fulfilled. So consider consider your mental health as always as this psychologist will recommend  and to wrap up this podcast episode.

Hello everyone and welcome back to the jimsy girl podcast. My name is Abby Iceland and I am the host. It is currently like 10 p.m. On Christmas Eve. So Merry Christmas, I married Lee Christmas, I guess because this episode is definitely going up way after Christmas, but I am currently recording this now just because it tonight is actually my last night in the house that my family has lived in for the past six years fish and Answer moving and yeah, so it's my last night here. So it's kind of like better sweet but it honestly has not hit me at all. But I'm sitting here in my pretty empty room getting this podcast recorded because our internet turns off tomorrow morning Christmas day, so I got to get this done before I start traveling and yeah, I just wanted to have this done and not have to worry about it. But anyways today I know last week I shared with you guys, you know reasons that New Year's resolutions fail and I  Shared, you know five things to stop doing in 2020 that a lot of us are guilty of and this week is the week that I share with you guys my New Year's resolutions. So I don't really have a very structured plan for this podcast episode. Like I normally do for my episodes. I just listed out my resolutions and I'm just going to kind of let myself talk because I made these reservations autonomy these resolutions today, and I honestly thought I was going to have a hard time thinking of them, but they just like  Lou from my or I guess they flowed from my mind to my fingertips to my phone and I just knew everything right off the bat and I think they are probably my best and most tangible and specific resolutions. I've had in a long time and it's very interesting because two nights ago. I was staying up really late and it was like 2 a.m. And I just nothing in my subscription box on YouTube looked good, and I couldn't fall asleep. So  I went back and watched my New Year's resolutions videos from or for going in the 2019 and for going into 2018 and it is so crazy to go back and watch those and it's hilarious to because I literally had like 20 resolutions last year, which was just a little over the top and they weren't very tangible. So super excited for this episode to share my resolutions with you guys. I'm also going to have a Graphic on the Jin's ego podcast Instagram where you guys can screenshot it from your Instagram sore from  The Instagram story of the Jen Siegel podcast and put your resolutions and because I'm going to have like an Instagram post with mine in it, but then I'm going to put the blank one on the story. So you guys can screenshot and share yours. So I'm super excited for that. So all of us can kind of see what we're planning on doing or we what we want to get done in 2020. So yeah, I can't believe tomorrow is Christmas. This is like by far my favorite time of year and I feel like it always goes by so fast because it will always be Christmas Eve and I'm like how  How is this time of year already over like I just feel like everyone's a lot nicer and happier. But at the same time a lot of people aren't so happy or really stressed out and it's just really funny because I have had so many issues with shipping related things the past week. I ordered a week ago like a charcuterie box thing that came with like a bunch of different stuff in it for my boyfriend's family it I chose to be delivered today and it didn't deliver today and that really made me mad because it's  Is he not going to deliver on Christmas? So now they're going to get it after Christmas and I have ordered if you guys keep up with my YouTube channel or follow me on Instagram you would know this. But my very first pair of it Ultra boost that I bought during Black Friday, which is just the pair of tennis shoes. They came in the mail with dirt all over them and I ended up just taking them to the store and they cleaned them for me because they didn't have any in store and I just wanted to keep them but they ended up being too small. So I sold them and then I bought a new pair and the new  are finally came in this week and I ordered them from a different store and they came and dirty too and I don't have the store here in Florida where I'm at. So I'm gonna have to wait till I go to Texas I guess to return them but it's just been annoying with those two things then on top of that I didn't pack a lot of like sweaters and nicer outfits and or New Year's Eve outfit whatever I was coming home from school just because like all I packed with like pretty much comfy clothes and workout clothes it just because the Third  A finals week to two days before I left. This was like two weeks ago. I place like an order for this brand that I'm working with like on Instagram and they're sending me a bunch of clothes and I'm super excited for it and I've been so excited for it for this whole break and I've just been patiently awaiting the arrival of the package because I didn't get a tracking number until today, but I was told that it was supposed to ship out like Wednesday or Thursday of last week. And today is Tuesday of this week, and I didn't get a tracking number until the day when I  Ask for it and then I looked at the tracking number and the stuff didn't ship until yesterday when it was supposed to like six days ago. And now none of that stuff is going to come in time before I leave to go out of town and the schedule delivery is actually five days after I go out of town. So I'm kind of screwed because all clothes I was planning on having to wear while I am traveling for the last whole week of break. I'm not going to have like anything that I thought I was going to have a Time.  To go get a New Year's Eve outfit some kind of like stressing about that. But I think they're just chill things could be much worse. But those have been all of my shipping issues lately. And on top of that there are a couple things that I ordered is Christmas presents that I ordered on express delivery and I pay the extra money for the aren't coming in on time, which is annoying. So there's been a lot of little things here and there but I'm trying to just remain positive and just remember that it is a really busy season and it's just a part of our generation being impatient and getting things really quickly and  I'm not so that's kind of my fault. But anyways, let's carry on into the episode. So I want to go ahead and share the quotes of the week for you guys or for this episode. Whatever you want to call it. I found this quote on Pinterest and I actually am so obsessed with it and I am so obsessed with it because I found it after I made my resolutions and I feel like it's exactly the way I made my resolutions this year, which is why I feel like my resolutions are so good this year. So this year 2024  Change don't add new things in your life as a New Year's resolution instead do more of what's already working for you and stop doing things that are time-wasting. So I love this quote because not every single one of my resolutions this year are things that I'm already doing, but most of them are and I'm really like proud of myself for like really just taking a different perspective when making my resolutions, I think that a really great way to make resolutions that are a lot easier to  reach and that will actually improve your life and are things that are for you is when you sit down and you look at your life and you ask yourself, you know, what have I done in the past few years that has really made my life better or made me happier or just made things overall in general better and what things have just like been a burden to me and what things have wasted time and what things have wasted energy and taking out those things that like waste your time and energy and then doing more of the things that make your life better is  Really really great way to approach making your New Year's resolutions. So I just really love that quote. And like I said not all of mine were made in that way, but I feel like a lot of them were this year which is why I like to quote so much and my goal for this week. So this is like my last week of break because we go back on the 8th of January to college, which is insane. We only got three and a half weeks like from the last day of finals until the day classes start when we got three and a half weeks and there's some schools eat like four and a half or five.  Five and it's just not fair. I am so not ready for break to be over and have to like study and stuff again, but it is what it is. But anyways from vlogmas and everything. I'm like super burnt out from having to edit every day and all of that and like I really enjoy it but when I'm at home, I feel like I'm forcing myself to Vlog when I really just want to be enjoying my time at home and I really hate that but my goal for this week is to not work during this week at all because  I was not really able to relax at all while I was like actually at home during break just because I was so focused on vlogmas and pre-recording podcast episodes and you know packing all my stuff up getting rid of a ton of stuff. So I never got to truly relax and rest. I really just want to use this last week of break to just unplug enjoy my time at my boyfriend's house and then enjoy my time traveling from there with my family. So I just really  want to not work and I will probably Vlog I don't know vlogging is not really that big of a deal but I'm going to have to have videos to go up. It's more of you know, like the constant turnaround of editing and all that kind of stuff and like obviously if I have sponsorship related stuff that I have to do I will do that. But like I am not going to make myself, you know where myself out and you know where myself in this week just because it's my last week and I really really need to unplug and relax it.  Going to go into this semester as fully charged as I can and my gratitude this week is really simple. Honestly, I'm just really grateful to have a roof over my head and I feel like that's just kind of I don't know. I've just been having one of those weeks where I've just been like extra grateful for the things in my life. Like I'll find myself complaining about things are not shipping in time. And then I'm like, you know it I'm just grateful to you and be able to afford these things. I'm just grateful to be able to even get people presents and go online and order presents and  and not everyone can do that and I'm just really thankful for the little things this week. So let's go ahead and get into my resolutions before 2020 and I highly encourage you guys to share your resolutions with me and the agenda girl podcast Facebook group. If you look up jimsy girl podcast on Facebook and you find it see a group that comes up just click on it and there are three super simple questions that you shouldn't get wrong. If you follow me on Instagram or YouTube or listen to the podcast and you  And join after answering those questions and I will approve you so definitely share your resolutions and there or you can share them on the Instagram post that I make whatever this podcast releases on the agenda girl podcast Instagram and I always have those link down below for you guys. So anyways, the first resolution I have is to give thanks or actively practice gratitude once a day. So this year one of my I think one of my resolutions of 2019 if I remember  Oakley was to practice gratitude more often and I definitely did that especially towards the latter end of 2019. I really didn't find myself doing it as much in the spring but I have done it so much this past fall semester and I truly truly feel like it has made my life so much better. And I know that people say all the time, you know, if your gratitude your life changes and you have a better perspective and blah blah blah and you hear it all the time, but I promise you it is so  So true just because you become so much more content with what you have rather than searching externally for what you don't have and I talked about that in the last podcast episode so I won't talk about it talk to ear off about it again this episode. But anyways, I just really think that when I practice gratitude I have better days overall and I find that I am I kind of like just that energy you just kind of radiates from me. I feel like the people around me are happier when I practice gratitude.  attitude I feel like I out really expressed gratitude and niceness more is kind of sort of I just had a nice Nest but I feel like all that happens more the more I practice gratitude and even if it's just something as little as like opening my eyes in the morning and just being thankful that you know, I have a roof over my head or that the sun shining whatever it is something as small as that but I say actively practice gratitude because I find that when I go like the extra mile just you know, like leave an extra few dollars at  That our restaurant or be super nice to the retail worker or the grocery shop person, you know, like whatever it is. I feel like when I go the extra mile or like let someone and in front of me when I'm driving just little things like that really just you notice that it makes you feel better on the inside. Like I don't know how a person could do any of those things and then feel worse afterwards. It just fills your heart with warmth. So I want to keep doing that and that's an example of something that I looked at in my life in 2019. That was  Really working for me and made my over overall life better that I want to do more of and continue going into 2020. Okay. So number two. I want to start investing money and spend less money eating out. I kind of combined these two just because I don't want to have two different resolutions and regard to money, but I kind of like obviously I know that like, I just don't want my money in my savings account to just like be sitting there. I would like to be investing it and actually like earning money off of  Investments instead of just letting it sit there and not really gain any interest and obviously like that is kind of a process but that's something I would like to look into maybe this summer during my internship. I would really like to look into that and just kind of start early because I know the younger you start the batter and it's been something I wanted to do for so long, but I feel like it wouldn't have made sense for me to do it until now with the income I have so I just really want to start doing that just because I feel like it's a step in the right direction.  Auction financially for me and I say spend less money eating out just because mainly it wasn't so bad like this summer or the spring semester. But this past fall semester with all the issues. I had in my house like with rodents and everything. I just hated going in my kitchen because that's where they mainly were and it just freaked me out and I didn't like cooking in there. So I would I like sometimes I would have the nerve to go in my kitchen and stand in there and make meals and do dishes and everything another days. I didn't so I  There's only cooked like twice a week, which is horrible, but I would eat breakfast at home, of course and usually lunch but eating dinner all like five nights a week four nights a week. Whatever it is is not very reasonable and it definitely takes a toll on your wallet. So I want to spend less money eating out for sure this year just because I did that a lot and kind of maybe just get more into cooking and like try new recipes and you know, like actually Branch out with what I'm cooking and take the time to do that because I think that would be worth  it just to switch things up, but I know it's going to be hard for the first five months of the year doing that because I'm going to be in the same kitchen. I'm going to have the same issue with, you know, not being freaked out over the road at stuff. That's my own personal problem. So number three this one's kind of hard because I wanted to make it more tangible, but I didn't know how to make it tangible while keeping it realistic if that makes sense. I wanted to develop a writing and or reading routine whether that's you know,  In five pages of a book every night or writing down like just journaling two pages every night and maybe not even every night cuz that's honestly a little unrealistic for me. But at least I'm going to say once a week. I want to do some kind of journaling or some kind of reading for at least like 20 minutes 30 minutes just because I find that, you know, obviously the more you read the smarter you become and like I think that reading really helps you escape your reality and no matter what genre it is.  Even if it's like self-help, I feel like it really helps you like Envision an idealized version of yourself, and it really helps you strive to reach that point and it's just like a nice little escape from reality to just like dig your nose in a book or two Journal alter thoughts and it's very therapeutic in a sense to do either of those but I know that it's not very realistic for me to say I'm going to do it every single day because some days are a lot busier than others and that's life. And that's okay. I don't expect myself to just like January 1st. I  Every single day but I would really really like to you know develop some kind of routine to wear once a week. I'm at least getting 20 or 30 minutes of that kind of writing and reading exercise end just because I feel like it's really good for me mentally and emotionally number four. I want to dedicate one day a week for prioritizing self-care. So I have said a million times that I am the type of person to put myself last on the list of priorities, especially when there's a lot going on, you know.  No, I tell myself that I'll like I'll be fine. I don't have to make time for taking care of myself and I will just do it whenever I have spare time which ends up being never because I'd never really have that much spare time. So the whole problem is that you know, I tell myself. Oh, I will, you know treat myself and have like a little night to myself and really just take care of myself and really make sure I'm in a good place mentally and emotionally and physically whenever I have the time to and then you know,  He goes by a week goes by a month goes by a few months go by and I realized that I haven't really had like a check in with myself because I've been putting myself last on my list of priorities and I am so done doing that in 2020 and a lot it's interesting because a lot of these resolutions are very personal. I feel like instead of it being like things about like, you know, family members and friends and like doing all these things socially I feel like a lot of them are very internally personal.  To me which obviously resolutions are going to be personal because it's for you individually, but if you know what I mean, like none of them are really about like all of these outward social type of things a lot of them are very internal for like my mental and emotional health because I know that I need to prioritize that more. But anyways, I just one night a week. I don't care what night it is, but I'm going to hold myself accountable and put it in my calendar. I was like a little reminder every week, you know, like self care. I don't care if it's you know,  I don't it doesn't have to be anything extravagant self-care can literally be journaling. It can be reading some of a book could just be lighting a candle and watching a favorite TV show whatever it is. I just want to have time to unplug and just like really detached from my phone detach from society detach from myself and detach from my work and school and just have like 30 minutes once a week. Maybe even an hour if I have the time to just unplug and  Really like just invest that time than myself so that I can be a better person at the end of the day because I find that when I do take the time to invest that time of myself. I am a much calmer person. I am lot more patient. I am I get less irritable quicker like you like my tempers better. I am happier. I feel a lot more calm and less stressed. So it's just a win-win overall for me and the people in my life when I actually don't let myself.  Run myself dry and when I actually taken care of myself, so that's definitely an important one that I knew I had to put all my resolutions list number five have comfort and surrendering control. Oh my gosh, you guys I felt like Janice from friends when I just said that but I really am horrible about just like letting go when things are not inside my circle of control, you know, my mom has  Always like told me growing up, you know, if it is outside of your circle of control do not give it the time of day for you to stress over and it's advice that I always give other people, you know, I always tell people you know is that inside of your controller is outside of your control if it's inside of your control do what you can to fix that so that you don't have to worry about it anymore. But if it's outside of your control, you just gotta let it go and you can't get worked up over it. You can't get upset about it. You can't get mad about it. Whatever it is you have  Let It Go and I am just so horrible about you know, letting all of this Stress and Anxiety build up about things that I literally cannot control because they are in the future because they don't involve me personally or if they do involve me personally it's not my decision and it's someone else's decision whatever it is, you know, like whether it's like you're in a relationship and you just have a lot of like relational anxiety, I know that I've like gone through phases of life where I have had a lot of trust issues and  I've had a lot of relational Stress and Anxiety of you know, like not feeling good enough or just being like really paranoid and stuff just from trust issues and I feel like that type of thing is outside of your control because I mean obviously like if you have if you're carrying trust issues over from one relationship to the next that is inside of your control and you need to do what you can to fix that and not carry it over. However, it is not inside of your control that you have those trust issues because of who  I gave them to you if that makes sense. So you control what you can and what you can't control you let go of so I just want to find comfort and peace and surrounding surrendering control and that's just like a relationship example, but I think the most relevant and primary example that I really think of whenever I like put this down as my resolution is just like the course of my life and my career because I'm in that phase of life right now where I'm about to graduate.  Yes, I have an internship lined up right after school, which is incredible. But who knows if I'm going to enjoy it or not? Who knows if I'm going to get a job offer or not? Who knows if that's what I'm gonna do for you know, the beginning of my career and who knows if I am going to go to grad school or not. And all of that is kind of up in the air and a lot of those things can be in my control. But like for the most part all of that's outside of my control and I just need to be comfortable.  And you know like surrendering that and giving it to God and just being like this is outside of my control. I trust the plan that I have for my life. And if you're not religious, you know, you may think like oh, I trust the universe or whatever to bring me. You know, what's meant for me and for me, I trust God to you know, get do away with what's not supposed to be in my life and bring what is supposed to be in my life and I need to surrender the control of my life to  Him so that you know, I can have peace and I just think that trusting and that plan is really important for me, but it's something that I always have had a lot of trouble with because I am a control freak. I like things to be under my control. I like, you know, controlling everything in my life. Like I hate delegating things a lot of the time because I want things to be in my control. So it's really hard for me to just say, you know what I am at peace with whatever happens from here on out and I am comfortable with completely giving up.  This control to totally, you know, like not be on myself and I just think that that's really a beautiful thing to be able to say I surrender, you know my life and like all of like this anxiety and stress I have about my future and I am comfortable and at peace with where I am right now and my future plans and I hope that made sense to you guys since I don't have like a planned out like super planned out podcast episode besides the resolutions.  I'm selves. I'm literally just pulling stuff from my head whenever I think about these things and like I said, I think the most prevalent thing for that resolution for me is my career and I just really want to you know be comfortable with not knowing what's going on, you know, and I want to just tell myself it's okay and there's no reason to stress and I it's okay for me to just be comfortable and surrender that control and be comfortable with that so number six counter every  I would have thought with a positive one. So yeah, I want to do an entire episode on self-talk and confidence because your girl has made quite the 180 since she was in high school with self-talk and confidence and self-esteem and just because I'm a lot better now than I used to be does not mean that I don't have bad days where I'm hard on myself and you know, I'm looking at myself in the mirror.  Our and I'm just thinking, you know, you're not good enough. You don't look good or I'm just looking at my accomplishments and I'm just like these good accomplishments aren't good enough. How are you ever going to get anywhere in life? And I look at you know, my friend should send relationships that I'm like, you're not good enough of a friend or significant other blah blah blah and I have days where I tell myself that and a lot of the times it's not true and it's just, you know, the devil talking and it's just like not me and it literally comes from a place.  Of insecurity and anxiety and fear and stress comes from a dark place and not a light place. So I want to overshadow those dark thoughts that come from the dark places with light thoughts. And every time I have one of those darker thoughts or that not-so-nice thoughts or whatever you want to call them. I want to counter every single one of them at the positive one. And I think that training my mind to do that every time I have a thought that is just you know,  Self-deprecating I guess and just not good for me to be telling myself. I just want to be able to counter it with a positive one. And I think doing that will really trained me to you know, maybe do negative self-talk less or to just make sure I am recognizing the positives Every Time. I Think of a negative and I think that's a really great way to go about life in general anytime. You have like a negative experience happen or something.  If you can take that negative and just look at the positive of the situation, even though there is a really large negative. If you can just focus your attention and your thoughts on the one positive thing, even if it's only one positive thing and there's a million and one negative things. If you just turn your attention and turn your focus to the positive thing. I promise you you're not going to dwell on the negative stuff as much if that makes sense so number seven.  I want to maintain going to the gym four to five times a week. So if you guys listen to my fitness journey episode or if you guys have been keeping up with me on YouTube for the past like five or six months since June, I would say I've been working out consistently and I've gone at least like three times every week except for when I have mono or if I was traveling and it has been absolutely the best possible thing. I could have done for myself because it is a great mental Escape for me that has helped me.  You know gain more confidence. I feel strong mentally and physically and it is just truly something I enjoy doing and I like look forward to and it's something I crave every week now that it is a part of my routine. And this was another one of those things where I looked at my life and I looked at what was working and I looked at what has made my life better this year and it's something that I want to continue and carry over into 2020 and keep doing for sure and I highly encourage you guys, you know, I know everyone's near his resolution whenever they  start out is like January 1st. So like I'm going to go to the gym, you know, five six times a week every day this week, whatever and just remember to be realistic with yourself allow yourself to get into that routine. It took me about a month and a half or two months to get into the routine of going three times a week, but I really really enjoy it and I kind of adopted the four times a week towards the end of the year and now I really want to kind of like Strife or five times a week. So four to five times a week would be awesome and you know it is  The rest I don't think working out everyday is ideal. So that will never be one of my resolutions, but I just want to remind you guys to be realistic with yourself and to just like give yourself the time because you know change doesn't happen overnight. So, how are you supposed to change your lifestyle overnight? You have to give yourself that time and you have to be patient with yourself. So number eight less social media time. I feel like all of us unless you don't have any social media could really use this one I have  Of days and weeks where like I only go on like once a day. I find that like when I'm at home at least this week, I've gone on social media less. I think honestly just because I feel like it's cool. I'm trying to keep up with everyone and I'm trying to like just take a break from studying or like in between classes. I'm getting on it and I feel like at home. I haven't been getting on it as much or at least not every form of social media of probably been on Instagram just as much but I feel like Twitter and Snapchat and stuff. I just haven't got on is  Anyways, I really and truly know that I spend way too much time on it. I could probably get way more done if I didn't spend as much time on it and it's not that I sit there and like just scroll through things for forever because I do have self-control. I normally don't steal my phone for more than like five minutes those five minutes a day, like multiple times a day adds up, you know, and I kind of just want us to drive towards only getting line like maybe once in the afternoon or early afternoon and then once in the evening or  Or even just once at night like before I go to bed. I just really do not want to waste my life on social media because it will always be there but my life will not and I'd really prefer to just live out my life rather than spend that time on social media and like I said, there's some days where only get on once but there's other days where I go on like 20 times. I'm like, what am I doing? And I really hate that there's so many forms of social media because it makes things even harder. But yeah, I really just want to limit the amount of time.  I spend on social media.  So number nine, I only want to consume constant content is a consent that is educational informative or entertaining without having a negative impact on myself. So I have talked about this a little bit before I believe in the podcast and I genuinely have just like come to this realization particularly at the end of this year that just because I'm watching content doesn't mean I should be or just because I'm listening to some  After that mean I should be just because there are a lot of things I don't want to like repeat myself too much with this because I know I've said in other episodes but I find that there's a lot of things that subconsciously really impact me from the content. I consume just like through podcasts and YouTube videos and just even social media content and either I say subconsciously because initially, I don't think it affects me at all and then you know, I  Start thinking about it. And I realized that deep down is either, you know made me think worse of myself. It's kind of like led me to compare myself to someone else or whoever's producing the content. It's influenced me to feel the need to spend more money when I shouldn't be but that's kind of just like they're going to consumerist culture of social media and I just really don't want to put the time into consuming that content and wanting to  And I know it's going to be hard for me to like cut all of that out. But like I want to find, you know podcasts and YouTube channels actually provide value and aren't just like money based or like money driven or just making me feel like I need to spend money or making me feel like I need to look a certain way or talk a certain way or be a certain way because that's not healthy. So I really want to limit that content and I think that you guys should probably take a look at the content you're consuming as well and if you  You really sit down and think about like how content makes you feel after the fact if you can like ask yourself questions, like do I feel like I need to like go buy something right now, but I feel like I need to go spend money. Do I feel like I need to look a certain way right now. And if you can kind of like ask yourself questions about the content and honestly most times if the content is good content a time-consuming like it is educational informative or entertaining or whatever.  I don't find myself asking those questions, you know, I feel content after I watch it and I just kind of go on with my day, but I feel like the content. I consume that where I'm like kind of starting to question things about myself or just kind of question how I'm feeling. Those are the ones that kind of sent a red flag for me personally. So number 10. This one is probably the biggest one and most important one because this is the one that your girl has struggled with her entire life, and she is finally putting her foot down and saying no more.  Of this crap and you have got to just cut it out like leave this in 2019 2018 2017 and all those other years that you've been doing it. So I want to do things that actually make me happy. I don't want to do things just because they're the standard and I want to let go of the fear of taking The Road Less Traveled and learn how to be honest with myself with what I want. So I know that was long-winded, but maybe you should rewind it and listen to what I said again because I have a  Feeling that a lot of you guys struggle with this as well. And I feel like this so pertinent in my life with work like my career and my major and school and YouTube because I have I feel like then someone to go through the motions with a lot of things like YouTube and school and my career and I just kind of do things that are the norm or what is considered the norm just because I feel like that's what I'm supposed to do, but just because  That's what everyone else is doing. That's in that same genre or lifestyle is me doesn't mean that I have to either you know, like no one said all majors of this type have to go down this certain path and do this certain job and career path and take this certain road, but it really feels like that's the way it's kind of advertised at least for my major and I really am so sick of just being so worried about  about not taking or doing this standard that I just neglect what I really want and what really makes me happy because I am scared to take The Road Less Traveled and I feel like I have to stay on this little path that everyone else is on and that goes for YouTube that goes for work career, whatever Etc and I am honestly like such a liar to myself because I find myself all the time. I  I know deep down what I want and I know deep down what I love and I know deep down what I want to do, but I just like have lived a life denying that out of fear of taking A Road Less Traveled. Does that make sense? And I just really hate it. I am sick of it. I can't take it anymore. I'm getting to the point where you know being an imposter with myself is sickening and it's wearing me out.  Out and it is making me less motivated and it is really distorting my view of my future and my career and it's bad because I've spent all this time, you know telling myself. This is what I want to do. This is what makes me happy. When oh my God, it is not like it is not what I want to do. It is not what makes me happy. I'm only telling myself that I want to do these things and that I'm going to do these things because everyone else around me is doing them and that's the  That's you know, it's a standard. It's a road that's more often traveled with more foot traffic whatever and it's totally okay. It's a branch off and go your own way. It is totally okay to be honest with yourself and you know, let go of something you've worked so hard on just to do the thing you really want to do because a lot of times life is all about figuring it out and figuring it out takes trying things sometimes and realizing you hate them. A lot of times you find where you want to be and you  find what you want to do by figuring out what you don't want to do and a lot of times the things that you don't want to do initially were things that you did want to do and then they whenever you realize that it's something you don't want to do or something. You don't like those are the signs. You know, that kind of lead you down a path of going where you really need to be and I think that's totally okay. I'm just so tired of you know sitting here telling myself. This is what my career is going to  Like and I'm going to do this because that's what everyone else around me is doing and that's what people do in this field and this major and that's what I have to do to it's not you know, like obviously I don't mean like right out of the gate. I'm just going to go like go on a whim and do something completely different cause I have to start somewhere obviously and I have to try things out but I feel like I have kind of dug myself in this hole from not being honest with myself and the beginning and if you're listening to this,  This and you find yourself, you know kind of doing something just because you think it's secure and comfortable and you're kind of just settling with it. Chances are you shouldn't be doing it? And I find that whenever you are honest with yourself and initially that's when you really set yourself back and that's kind of what has happened to me and I feel like I would have never been that honest with myself about  What I want to do with my life and you know what? I want my long-term career to be and you know where I want my YouTube channel to go what I want to do on YouTube what I want to do, you know Venture wise whatever it is. I've never been honest with myself upfront deep down. I've known it and I've known that I'm not going in the right direction, but I've just kind of like stuck with it because it's what was comfortable and I've let myself lie to myself for years now about my  And my future and now I'm at a point where I recognize it and I realized the hole I've dug myself in from not being honest with myself up front and not doing what I really enjoy and what really makes me happy from the get-go. That was a really long-winded explanation, but I don't just mean that with my career and my major because I do enjoy it and I do like it, but I just don't think that the past.  The standard path that is set out for me is what I meant to do at all. Like I already know that do I think it's a great starting point. Absolutely. I am going to go in with you know, just I'm just going to go in with a very open mind. I'm not going to have really enact any expectations of it because I don't want to create this like Picture Perfect Vision in my head. It's impossible to attain in a job and then, you know set myself up for disappointment with working and I'm also not going to lie to myself  Any more though about what I want to do because I have known what I wanted to do for a long time. I've just been lying to myself about it for a very long time and I'm at a point now where I'm realizing that I have dug myself in this hole and now it's time for me to get myself out. So that's that but I just highly encourage you guys if you I'm sure a lot of you guys feel the same way, you know deep down what you want to do what you enjoy doing what you like? What hobbies you enjoy Etc, but you've been lying  NG to yourself out of fear or out of fear of being uncomfortable or out of fear of taking The Road Less Traveled and if you don't listen to me right now and stop doing that you're going to end up doing what I did and digging yourself in this really deep hole that's going to be really hard to get out of because you've been lying to yourself for way too many years. So highly encourage you guys to reflect a little bit on that if you're feeling the same way, but like I said, I don't mean that just in my career. I mean that in YouTube to because a lot of times I just do the standard, but I  I don't want to be a basic standard. You know what I mean? Like I want to create the content that I like actually really enjoying that I really want to do not do the things that I feel like I should be doing just because it's what pot. What is popular and what is what gets the most views and you know, like I didn't create a podcast because it was the thing to do for YouTubers like the next platform to venture out into I started a podcast for so that I could you know, like actually communicate with you know other  People besides my subscribers and my subscribers as well more in detail about things that I'm passionate about and things that I find that I can help others with and I always want to do things for that kind of reasoning. I never want to do things just because I feel like it's the norm and I feel like doing things just because you feel like you have to and just doing things because you feel like that's what you're supposed to do because it's what everyone else does never really ends right or well for anyone you always end up in a place where you're not supposed to be  That makes sense. So that is all of my resolutions. I definitely wanted to keep it to 10 just because I felt like if I go more than 10, I just like don't even remember most of them, you know what I mean? And I have them all the set out on my phone, but I plan on either making a graphic with them and putting them out and likes taking them on my bathroom mirror or I plan on just writing them on paper and sticking them somewhere where I see them every day and I highly encourage you guys to do the same. So I hope this episode helped inspire you guys.  Eyes to kind of set your resolutions and always remember that you don't have to wait for a new year to set resolutions. You can several resolutions every single day if you want to obviously, that'd be a little bit complicated but you can do it. You don't have to wait for a new week a new day, you know like you can start now and that's all you need to know and that's all you need to go forward. So I highly encourage you guys to sit down and think about what works for you and this past year and I encourage you to  Urge you to do more of those things and think about what didn't work this year what drain your energy and time and eliminate start gradually eliminating those things from your life. So, I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. Be sure to give a review and be sure to follow the Jen's Eagle podcast on Instagram. It's just at gen Z girl podcast and join the Facebook group as well. So you guys can keep up and I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and I will talk to you guys next week. Bye.
Today is Monday, November 4th 2019 on this day in 1921. The Prime Minister of Japan Hora Takashi was assassinated. He was about to board a train to attend a political conference in Kyoto when he was ambushed and killed by a young ultra-nationalist Railroad switchman. Welcome to today and True Crime app are cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're discussing the assassination of Japanese prime minister Hara to Kashi one of the most influential Japanese politicians of the 20th century. Now, let's go back to the evening of November 4th 1921 a little after 7 p.m. Takashi rubbed his eyes as he stepped out of his Carriage he checked his watch then his ticket. The train was leaving in half an hour. He was right on time. He walked towards the station door eager to board his train the sooner. He could start his ride to Kyoto the sooner he could Drift Off to Sleep. He'd been working all day all month all year. He'd been working all his life and it seemed like he only ever arrested in transit. He opened the door to Tokyo station and stepped inside Takashi looked around at the columns and ticket booths and smiled. The station had been built a little less than seven years earlier and he still remembered a time when railroads themselves were inconceivable to the Japanese people. His Nation had come so far and he had  Every intention of bringing them further than they had ever thought possible. He had traveled to Europe. He had traveled to the United States. He'd seen the vast extent of their Technologies The Fearsome power of their industry the efficiency of their governing systems. He wanted the same for his people. Of course, there were many who didn't see things the same way. There was the old bureaucracy who wanted to regain power. There were those commoners  All devoted to the emperor thinking him a god-king descended from Amaterasu herself and there were the ultra-nationalist who wished for Japan to return to the old days when the nation was closed off from the rest of the world left to Skirmish and squabble between themselves Takashi continued forward towards the turnstile. He had plenty of time to think about the fate of his Nation later right now. He just needed to catch his train.  As he walked he saw the people in the station looking at him Whispering about him one man in particular glared at him with Venom in his eyes Takashi rolled his own and kept walking. They would always talk. They only ever talked they perpetually left it to men like the prime minister to act he checked his watch then picked up his Pace strolling by the ticket booth a column stood.  Between him and the turnstile he turned to walk around it then from behind the column a man sprinted towards him. No not a man to Kashi could see his face was young impressionable. His eyes were filled with the Blind Fury of the youthful and in his hand. He held a knife to cause she barely had time to process the site before the young man came leaping towards him.  He saw the boy raised his blade and bring it straight into his chest. He felt the sting of the sharp metal once then twice then again and again and again, he fell to the ground and the boy continued his attack as he looked at the poor young man and felt the blood rapidly leaving his body. He could only think one thing I hope Japan will do well without me.  Up next will unpack the repercussions of takashi's assassination.  Hey friend, I want to tell you about the new $3 Little John from Jimmy John's a skinny mini version of any original sandwich for only 3 bucks. It's littler than a regular sandwich, which is perfect. If you're not super hungry, or if you want to try a couple different sandwiches, or if you like bragging that your lunch only cost $3 order a three dollar Littlejohn at Jimmy John's.com or with the Jimmy John's app at participating locations taxes and delivery fees extra.  Now back to the story.  Shortly before 7:30 p.m. On November 4th. 1921 Japanese prime minister Hara Takashi was assassinated in Tokyo Station. His killer was an 18 year old Railway switchman named na kyouko Kenichi. The young man was an ultra-nationalist who felt the takashi's Embrace of Western culture and the widespread changes. He made to Japan's political systems would inevitably lead to the downfall.  All of the nation Kenichi also claimed that Takashi was responsible for rampant corruption within the government Clooney cheese radical politics drove him to commit an act of great evil. He was wrong to think that takashi's politics would destroy Japan, but he was correct in thinking that the politics were massively influential.  In 1603 Japan was dominated by the Tokugawa shogunate a family composed of powerful military leaders afraid of the encroaching influence of foreign powers, the shogunate enacted an isolationist policy called sakoku any Foreigner who stepped foot on Japanese soil was put to death and any Japanese commoner who dared to leave the islands was also executed.  To koku effectively isolated Japan from the rest of the world for over 250 years. The Tokugawa shogunate was able to maintain its power but Japan's stagnated technologically as a result in 1853, the shogunate received a rude awakening in the form of four u.s. Naval warships arriving in their Harbors two of these war ships were powered by steam technology many of the Japanese.  Knees had never even thought possible. These ships were led by Commodore Matthew Perry who had been sent by the United States with the express goal of establishing international trade with Japan the Americans display of technological power made the Japanese recognize that they were outclassed by foreign powers and effectively intimidated them into opening their borders. Every previously Waring shogunate United under the banner.  Honor of the emperor then desperately joined the arms race to defend their Nation from military incursion. It was the most dramatic political shift in all of Japanese history. And in 1856 Hara Takashi was born into that political revolution.  Takashi was born into an influential Samurai family their rank in society provided them special benefits his father and uncles resisted the unification of Japan and the westernization of its values. But even as a young man to Kashi thought these efforts were futile and foolish takashi's openness to Western ideas ultimately took shape in his education. He decided to attend a free Catholic school called the Mariners.  Seminary which had been established by the French while there he learned how to speak French and English and studied the Christian faith at the age of 17. He converted to Christianity and was baptized as a Catholic by 19. He rejected his family's honorary Samurai class and instead took on the class title of commoner establishing himself as a man of the people. He attended law school at the ministry of justice, but wasn't  Expelled when he organized a student protest after his expulsion Takashi worked as a journalist for two different papers calling for political changes. He was exposed to Western Government systems at his parochial school and believed Japan should restructure its own government as a constitutional democracy in 1900 when he was 44 years old. He joined up with a newly-formed political party called the Rican say Yuki.  Which translates to Association of friends of constitutional government previously. Each government position was granted to people as a political favor resulting in widespread nepotism corruption and neglect of official government Duty by joining the Rican say Yuki Takashi began his political career as he climbed the ladder. He made it his primary goal to wrest power away from the former nobility and give it to  Competence civil servants chosen by the people takashi's efforts gained him widespread popularity in 1914 when he was 58. He was appointed president of the Rican say Yuki, his presidency was met with some moderate instability at first but in 1917, he led his party to take control of the diet. Japan's legislature his policies proved. So popular that by 1918 he  Elected Prime Minister of Japan his election was historic for several reasons. He was the first commoner elected to the prime minister's seat earning him the nickname commoner prime minister as a baptized Catholic. He was also the first Christian prime minister a rarity in a nation where Christianity was a minority religion Takashi also managed to fill his cabinet with politicians entirely from the Rican sayuki effectively.  In stating the first government controlled almost entirely by democratically elected officials rather than the nobility of old Japan. This was exactly his intended goal as he long thought that the system of political parties used within Western democracies was an ideal form of governance do to takashi's fondness towards Western values his past as an ambassador to Korea and many other factors several sects of the Japanese population.  In including conservatives, ultra-nationalists isolationists and religious imperialists felt. The takashi's rain was destroying Japan from the inside some even felt the takashi's efforts to replace the old nobility and their Corrupt Practices was instead takashi's own corruption as he seized ever more power. He started to receive death threats these threats were taken. So seriously.  Seriously that when Japanese dignitaries traveled to Washington to attend the Washington Naval conference in November 1921. The American Military provided armed escorts. The world was already in shock because earlier that month on November 4th Takashi was assassinated in his home country by his own people following takashi's death the Rican say Yuki started to fracture.  They maintained power for over a decade. However, they never again reached the heights. They had accomplished under takashi's leadership with the loss of power within political parties the nation began to slide deeper into imperialistic Power until 1940 when they joined the Axis powers and fought in World War Two.

Hi, my name is Amber and this channel is going to be about magic witchcraft Wicca and paganism as a whole farmer my first episode I want to talk about how I came into Wicca and how it's not  evil as people think it is just start with one share my story with you coming into Wicca are grew up in a very religious home. I was always very involving church and sunday-school and like weekly children's programs at church and my mom from the  I'm I was  born took me to church and I always felt like well, this is what I'm told is real and this is what they say will get me to heaven. So if I don't want to be damned to hell like  I need to be a Christian and so for the first 25 years of my life. I'm 26. I really struggled with learning.  Other religions in school. We took a world religion class dish for some backup. We learned about a lot of other religions.  And it really fascinated me, but then I was like no because I'll go to hell if I even consider these are real, so I kind of put it in the back of my mind growing up. I went to I public school for elementary school, and I was known as Miss Cindy from churches daughter and I grew up in Sunday School.  And everyone knew me as the good little Christian girls, so to speak that stereotypical good little Christian girl my Sunday school teachers would tell me. Oh, your mom is so wise and you know, she's a really godly woman. And so yeah and a little bit more on that in probably the next episode.  why I disagree with that so I would  I would go to church every week every Sunday every Wednesday and every Sunday night and every Saturday night that go to school and like the school is right by the church. So like all the church kids knew me and they all knew me as miss my Cindy the church lady is daughter and I was expected to be this perfect little angel. By the way. My real name is Charity I go by  Number as my preferred name with my childhood. I was raised as Charity. So if you hear me slip up and say my real my birth name, that's why especially in refiling childhood stories. So anyway back to my game to Wicca. I always always fascinated even as a young child with ancient culture and a drink day.  DD's and mythology and you know, I loved it. I loved learning about it absolutely loved it. But it was always in secret that I had to do research because I was told they were Idol worshippers and I was told that only there's only one God and if you believe in any other God it's it's demon it's demonic and it's it's you're going to go to hell so when I got to Junior High I  Went to a Christian junior high and I studied the Bible and I went to Chapel every week and it was really like religious focused and I did not like what I learned in Chapel and in church by that age. We were learning how like in the Bible it says if you are not a follower of Christ.  I stand you don't believe he died on the cross for you when you die. You'll be thrown out like a fire and that just really did not settle. Well with me I started hating my real name as it is from a Bible verse and I mean this Godly love or perfect love and I hate that name hate it. I hate it. I hate it and I wanted to start going by my middle name, which is Karan and  I won't tell you my last name because I really don't want people to like Google me, but my family refused to call me by my middle name as they also refused to call me and more Amber. And of course they preferred my first name and they still do and my friends called me Karan for a while it is.  is a beautiful name but  I don't remember what it means and I'm my I had friends for the first time in school and Junior High and his great. I hated Amish clothes to use to work early. So I thought well, okay, maybe this Christian thing I'll work and I started seeing a  woman for discipleship in my church and started going to the youth group and I felt kind of accepted in the church, but I was so much younger and I was  Oster sounds very not socialable. I had very low I have Aspergers Syndrome. So I was very awkward and I didn't really feel accepted their I loved going to use group because I was around other people. I got to be away from my family for a while as I was very sheltered and I got to just be with other people semi close to my age and that  Was fun, but I really just felt very isolated and very alone otherwise, and so I didn't really feel the closeness to God that they felt I just pretended like I did so that I could get along with the other people in church as they were my only group of friends really and then I got to high school and I continued in a Christian High School. It was a different ice.  School and I got very sick very very sick. And I was in a wheelchair and a walker at 16 years old. I was on a walker and then I got so sick. I couldn't really walk. So I went into a wheelchair for the next three or four years after that and I really tried hard to cling to God. I tried so hard and I just felt so alone like nothing was  hearing me and people said you know, if you pray enough God will hear you you just pray enough and God will give you hope and he'll give you life and  Trust me. I prayed I prayed as hard as I could I read my Bible as often as I could even in class and I mean most kids freed, you know, Twilight and glass. Nope. I was trying to read my Bible in class and I really don't feel that closeness. I went ahead and got baptized in the Christian church thinking. Oh, maybe that'll that'll bring me to God closer. Maybe he'll listen to me then and he didn't  When I was 19 years old, I went to this weird. I guess you could call it a church, but it really wasn't was more like an occult. And the Pastor said I don't know what's wrong with you man. But God wants me to pray over you and I was an extraordinary pain that night as again. I was very sick and I did on my way.  wheelchair, so I was trying very hard to walk on my Walker and he you know prayed over me and I was able to walk from then on but  I still didn't feel accepted in the church and I didn't feel like God was really listening to me or that he was there for me and I didn't feel realness from God. I felt like that man used Magic on me in the guise of God and nevertheless whatever happened. I've been well ever sent.  You can call it God and you can call it magic. It's totally up to you. But I continued researching like other religions at this point off and on and none of them really set. Well with me I felt an extraordinary closeness to Nature and I didn't really know what to do with that. And so I was constantly like going outside is going for walks with my dog and just really spending time.  Time and I felt so close and so alive in nature and I went through a period of extreme depression and suicidal and I was in and out of the mental hospital constantly for a long time many years. And finally, I talked to a mental health case manager who was waking and I asked her questions. I mean, I just had laid them on her and she was able to answer my question.  about the religion and about how I felt this closeness to Nature and I was really interested in the different Pantheon's and so I had been in the hospital again for my meds not being right and I talk to the chaplain there who is required by law to adhere to any religion there by any patient so she got  get me information on Wicca and I got really I felt alive for the first time spiritually. It was real. It was something that I just connected to you and it was very much.  I felt so close to the wiccan rede. It was something I believed in I wasn't going to be damned to hell if I didn't believe this or didn't do that or anything like that and I was allowed to be myself as long as I don't harm anyone and there is like  no harm from the gods and the goddesses and I just started craving knowledge about this religion and I from November the think 26 on I just crave crepe crepe knowledge and read every book I could get my hands on for free. I got involved in a Min o Wicked and pagans grew by the way. I really recommend that group is soap  Of knowledge. I met a really great group of friends that are pagan or Waking and I just fell in deep love with nature even more and I found my Pantheon Gaia through this time period and she comes to me and many forms. It's just always watching out for me just always there when I need her and I feel her energy.  energy and everything I do and I started experimenting with magic at some point in this time period I did take a break from wake up because I wanted to please my mother who was very heartbroken that I was in a long Christian and we were going through a lot of fights and  For two months. I went back to church. I felt dead again. Spiritually. My energy was so low. I felt so sir pressed and soda just  emotionally and spiritually dead and I tried boy. I did try and I finally had enough and said that's it. I'm going back to Wicca. I felt so great and so alive and so myself and spiritually just soaring and I have been strong in my faith ever since. Wicca is all about helping.  Nature helping the Earth helping other people and being yourself as long as you don't hurt people or animals or Earth or anything or anyone else there is nothing evil about it. The Bible never says that  much about witchcraft it just in fact, it's there's several Bible verses about King sald using a medium and God struck him dead, even though he was able to win a war using that Medium. At least. I think if I remember correctly, I don't know. I haven't read my Bible in fuck like almost a year.  This is my language. I will write this explicit if there is a problem with that word I have.  Always had a problem with people judging other people for their religion and that is basically how I felt from the day I chose to be awake and I am actually an open Pagan and the people from the church I grew up in no, I'm a pagan and some of them have told me you're going to hell and I was very close to them and thought Oh, the totally won't judge me. It just really solidified. How much judge  There isn't that church that I grew up in and I mean no disrespect against anyone. That's a Christian. It's specifically the church I grew up in some people are very good to me from that church, and I'm still friends with them today and other people I probably won't talk to because they hurt me so badly and  So I just really reiterate do your research and if you're interested in wake up, this channel will be about Wicca and there's other channels that are really great here that our podcasts or even YouTube channels and there's the amino apps that have pagans and wiccans immuno and then there is the witch.  Crap, I'm you know, I think it's called witches Circle or something like that. I don't know great great apps to have here on this channel. I'll be talking a lot about how my journey and like where I'm at and do it with some informational podcast as well. So, yeah, welcome to my channel. Thank you for listening for the last 17 minutes to me rambling and  to stumble my way through from my very first podcast ever. I'm a little bit nervous. Have a great day. I'll see you next episode. Bye.

Um to get started Teresa gets real about Joe Danielle soul is black and we end the reunions on a lovey-dovey note Real Housewives of New Jersey reunions part 3 coming up right now, you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of tv top now look in here. I'm telling you this place is  So how long have we been doing? This five months 18 weeks? I love it more definitely cry at the end of the night. I don't know. I might get really emotional. Okay, we'll be back right off the battles bottles the thongs the whatever else we my promise and you broke a lot of promises really bad the worst. Hey guys, it is me.  Me I am on Cleo for the night because it's chilly in the studio. But it's Chelsea Cirque Jones and I am joined by my wonderful panel that I've Loved all season long Angelo Garcia guys super bummed out on this one, but it's okay. I know and I'm Angel Sanders and it's really hard. I can't even bring it. But you know what? I will have to say typically when I do three-part reunions They Don't Really deliver on the third one, but I was pretty entertained throughout the whole reunions. Yeah, they still hot.  A bang for my buck. Yeah, I mean they've always they brought it the whole time. Yeah, the ending of it was sweet. It wasn't like knockout drag-out or not wanted by that. I mean I'm expecting like, you know, like yeah, I don't know if there's one is like the peak, you know, like yeah and like they have like I'm like, yeah like leave me waiting for more like they let us can we get a black eye. I actually I I liked how it ended with Andy, but I felt like the gift for Teresa. We're all about  Off but we will definitely get into that towards a little bit later in the episode. But I mean this part of the reunions kind of picked up exactly where we left off with Teresa talking about Joe and she was you know, really honest. She says she can't do a long distance relationship. She even said Joe. Yeah, we'll probably be dating someone else in Italy a she was very like I guess realistic about that. She was really realistic and she also mentioned, you know, let's my kids want to go I don't see reason and going, you know, gee  Yeah, Gia's going to college Gabrielle is says that she doesn't want to go and she hasn't talked to other two daughters. But you know, they don't I don't know. She kind of felt a little emotionally detached to yeah. Yeah, would you guys why I think she was trying to portray that I feel like deep down inside. She probably does want to pick up and go but like she's trying to portray this whole like because she's been putting the vibe out. She's independent strong. She's got like portray that through this situation. I think it's definitely a lot to think about because she has been so independent exactly. He's been gone.  She especially with the fitness competition. She gained like this new Strength, but it's like I don't know it did seem like in the first two reunions that that she was crying a little more trying to like holds it in this one didn't seem like it so much. Maybe she was just she didn't get cold hearted kind of even when she said that they talked about it over the phone. Like that was a little bit weird to me like that, you know, like not go there. I mean you're married to this man. He is the only person you've had really a relationship with and you're going to talk about  Getting a divorce over the phone. Like, you know, that just seems a little bit strange. Anyway, here's our anything. She's like no over the phone. Yeah, so nonchalant a conversation. It's a kind of done but then you know what? She she said Joe her brother was you know saying whatever makes you happiest I'm here for and he kind of said, you know, it makes sense if he broke the trust in the relationship.  A ship there's not really much you could you could do from there? She's not find it to this because he deceived her. Yeah. Well Joe is super supportive. I'm signing me cajoling and now was a deception like cheating or was the deception just know the whole make the entire situation, right? Yeah for sure but he was so supportive of you know, I mean, like I feel like he's always kind of like messing with her like trying to bust her balls or whatever. Yeah, he was so supportive and so nice the really real about it. Yeah, and and that felt nice and then you know, Andy went around obviously.  Having to ask the other women what they would do in the situation and I feel like Margaret made a really good point like my children are older like yeah, I could get up and leave and go to Italy but Teresa has five young girls. Yeah, that's you know, that's uprooting their life for a mistake that their father did you know school is like a big deal to move out of the country and even Teresa was like, you know it at least beautiful. I would love to go there but she does have to do think the kids and of course. Yeah the language. Yeah. Well, that's a huge culture shock.  You can do that. Yeah, usually at that tender age. They're like still like finding themselves. Do you think maybe if they would have taken like a family trip while he was in jail like to Italy just so that they could see it a little bit and experience at that. Maybe I think they've been to Italy and one of the previous Seasons they went to Joe's Home Country. Yeah when the girls were younger and I mean, right but it's totally different when you're going to visit and like for fun and Leisure that it is. Yeah, you know and it's it's yeah, I mean, I totally understand it. I  It is sad to see like the family having to break up in that way. Yeah, but I mean it's realistic and I mean it also just shows this what you have to do when you pay like that's the price you gotta pay for a crime like that, you know, and you can't like you can't live in a fairytale about it. Like you can say. Oh, yeah. We're just going to move to Italy it's me like all great. You gotta be realistic about the Situation's you're putting your family in. Did you see though that she hesitated when Andy asked her has she been faithful to hell? Yeah. It's to say yes.  What's your answer? Like securely, she's like yes, but I also wonder if I also wonder like that guy that we've been seeing her with is that just a friend like what's going on with that? Because what if he doesn't get deported and like you I know open really faith. I have a little bit of stuff in these and gossip to kind of address not particularly that relationship but where Teresa's mind is that when it comes to her relationship with Joe. I did love how she talked about her her.  Later and how it was so awkward when she said her daughter found it. Milania third in the pond and she that break it. I don't know. I don't know she has it and I love how she's already teaching. Milania. You know masturbating is a beautiful thing. Yeah. I'm alone here.  Learn anything. So we wrap up Teresa conveniently, but before we switch over to when the men joined us, we have a little bit more news to talk about pertaining octopus. Yep.

Let us know what you're thinking particularly about this reunions and any thoughts that you have at all about the whole  Season we would love to hear what you have to say in the chat Charlie and charge love that name really fills that Joe ended it with Theresa first and he wonders if Teresa's dad wants to return permanently to Italy to I don't know. I mean that could work if he does that. Yeah, right when we still have the girls guys. I know but if there's more family over there, you're more inclined to go and more like, you know, I mean it'll feel like he is going to college so you're going to like leave and she is going to be in the u.s. Going to come back. She's gonna be away anyways.  Also kind of just like a fun Jersey. Yeah Captain like Rutgers. That's like a big step. It's like not have your mom there. Yeah, like that's a big address. Yeah. There's so much to like unpack with this whole. Okay what I want to know. Yeah is there they're having all this talk? And she says that if he doesn't get deported they're going to say together, but they've already like had so much talk about them being separated. How are they just going to get back together? You know what I mean? I don't know if they're like if they like you're getting too poorly if you get a port I don't want to be with you and then you stay I'll be with ya.  Spotted in Miami with this guy. That's weird. I mean, I have a hunch. I have a hunch anyways moving on. So we already had Joe Gorga at the at the reunions table with the women, but all the other men decided to join the party and we got to see like a cute little Montage of their moments throughout the season. They are hilarious Joe falling Joe so funny. It was definitely it was beautiful. It's really beautiful. Mama is fully the way he want. He was yeah he let out  So Andy asked them to give their taglines if they were to have one. I have written down three of my favorites. Who are you guys? What did what which once stood out to you? I'm gonna go for Joe Marge is Joe because it was the most awkward one that yeah, he was trying to be so funny with his delivery and everyone was like what what else? I like to build because I felt like his actually fit the show work too hard.  On it hurts that I as well be all we're given time to prepare it they didn't have but Bill has room in the mirror practicing at 174 weird too because it's like it's like they had time to rehearse we know that Andy said we asked you guys ahead of time and then bill was like hmm. Let's see like yeah, you know what you're gonna say, but I still think it was good and it Mason. Yeah, so I can't remember exactly what Joe Margarets Jose. Was that something like don't  Your wife yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was great. I did love bills and Nip/Tuck a day allows my wife to spend and play it totally makes sense for them. I also like I work hard and play hard until I spend my money on boats and Whores. I love that you're taking a job at yourself crate containing. Yeah, even though you're not a house husband because you're not married to Dolores. But anyways, I think is around and then of course, I love mr. Joe Gorga having to get up have a cape. I don't flip tables, but I know how to  So sexual, yeah, he had a cape cross is drop the curtain around them. It just reminded me of like a blanket and be a princess or whatever like yeah, that was Joe Gorga to me. But so I mean there wasn't really much that that really was discussed with.  Man, it was very light-hearted and very fun. And then it totally turned dark when the queen of Dark Souls entered just a dark shadow. And yeah, and I don't you definitely can't see but I did like the little like the little like face like the - and then the long - and this one like the Emoji. Yeah, I wrote that I said enter Danielle and then I made that face. I can't stand her can't stand her. Um, so her hair, huh? It was like so big she was yeah. It was like slowly.  I don't like her. I did it like her face. I didn't like her. I thought she went too far. I'm everywhere from lips. No, I feel like her cheeks filler that's in Italy like boom. Yeah. It's like she puts all these microphone cute and I love it.  I'm not really you're just so cute girlfriend does I don't like I don't like I don't know. I can't touch it honey. That's not what I meant. But so we get we catch up with Danielle. She you know reiterates her marriage with Marty was only 2 months long. However, after their divorce, they still live together, but they have restraining order but they have restraining orders of your across-the-hall like so I've learned and again this is something else will happen to know.  We get to news and gossip, but she didn't move out of the home because she has no money to move out of the home, which is sad and crazy cuz how do you not have enough money to at least rent an apartment? Yeah. See like that. Yeah, right. I don't understand. I do you pay money now for the house because downsize and if you have no money to pay for the house that I mean we could we could kind of discuss it so that kind of was a part of their divorce settlement was she either had to they either had to  The home or she had to buy the home and so she decided to buy the home and left her with no money. We'll get into that. So I mean I also I loved how the men because the men were here for this part. They were still here. When did you know? I love there snickering about Danielle throughout the thing like they were so much more caddy than the woman were like, I was someone would buy me at $35,000 ring.  So $35,000 dress. I'm exhausted. I was like dying by there like snide remarks. I was like you guys are such little that's right. Yeah. I felt a little awkward though because to fuss with well, I don't think it deserved to fuss because they were just like kind of joking good. It's like you can't fuck with a man. Well you can but I mean she probably would she would ya she would and I mean she even was like I loved what she was like Tim Alyssa what your  Said some nasty things about me and just like what I said, you must have good vagina. If you were married, if you're engaged 19 times over to Joseph. I thought that was a compliment I loved when they were showing like the Highlight Reel of like how annoying Danielle is and she's like, I think they left off with who pushed my husband in the pool. Great question to ask me out Danielle Danielle Danielle. Um, well, it's speaking of pushing Marty in the pool Joe and the  I put Joe Squared they both are still friends with Marty. Apparently Marty called the next day and like apologize to them. Was it the next day that he said I think they said that or like soon after and apologize to them about what happened and I mean even Joe markets Joe reiterated like I think what he was saying or words that Danielle has put in his head. Yeah, and I mean it definitely didn't sound like the Marty that we knew from early on in the season but I mean, yeah the three of them are friends Joe.  Was that they're getting lunch together this week this week? Yeah. I think it did happen the inside scoop you guys we did rubbing effects again. He said it wasn't good. Yeah. Okay great. Then you say the cameras were there. No. He said it was just that he's invited me to come but I could yeah, you can't fly to New Jersey just for lunch and he's got things to do. Um, and then  You know, okay. So back to this wedding with Marty and Danielle and Margaret really and the back and forth between are going to all we know their friendship is pretty much done. Yeah, I don't see any thing changing that yeah, but I think Margaret got a said what we were all thinking at least this was a I was thinking the whole Seasons Danielle you came on TV to get married so you could be relevant again. Yeah, I mean Wednesday. Yeah when they told her that she had no come back. She was just like to do that. Yeah. She never has a comeback.  She always gets busted and never knows what's up, and that's how she knew that's how you know, someone is wrong, you know, like you can't just like now but she's talented though for real though that 19th moves. Oh, I was like what now? She's talented. Well, you know what and then then we get back into the accusations of and I find this to be hilarious because we have Jennifer sitting next to Danielle. Yeah, Jennifer are you know shames Margaret for being you know a house home wrecker and Marge senior for being a homewrecker and here she is with  In Yahoo! She's like now starting to befriend. Yeah, and we hear that, you know, Danielle, you know slept with a married man when she was a prostitute and then she's like you're saying nasty things about me and Marcus like it's in your book and then she got it. I know so I know and again she said Jennifer she's like, is that true?  Yeah, so tell him to use in. Yeah, I love you guys. Um, yeah, so I mean it was just like and I loved how Marge was even like you're still the Beverly like that was I mean that was her name before that was that was engaged 19 times. Okay. She was going she yeah she and I mean, it's all factual. I know but that was pretty gnarly too. Like she was stating like such harsh facts if the truth hurts.  I had hoped for although I felt that in that moment because really I know you doing things and you know, you wrote about it in your book. I know she's getting called out in front of everyone like all her stuff. Well, you know, I mean like especially well does that she's got nine lives. She's never gonna die. She's gonna be back and she's gonna show me back with her face looks sad. I don't know. I just I got so you could tell that she has sadness in her face with the lack of emotion. She has with all those fillers like real lovers and I like I  Legitimately cannot be banned Danielle. Can we make that into a gift just like Angela like that one on the Jennifer face true love. Yeah, so I mean, you know, and you know who else had a really good face. I love Dolores. She was like very much in your face like they kept doing cutaways to Dolores.  Out like the Margaret Danielle exchange because it was great and like I mean Dolores was the first one to tell Margaret like warn her about, you know, Danielle and she's so sticking, you know tight to her guns calling her a whackadoo. Yeah, if someone called me a wackadoo, I would just be like girl what my God. She's a wackadoo like that like hurt my feelings at all these look at you like what is wrong with you? It was great.  Like I wasn't expecting to loras to pop off like that. I mean, I'm glad she did because Teresa clearly was in denial Teresa's. Yeah. Teresa doesn't care at all. Yeah. Now she doesn't and she she clearly made that she made that very clear. I don't I just I when Margaret was talking to her about the whole like someone said that about your kids. Yeah. Someone said like and even like Danielle was, you know poking at Dolores when  When Margaret says she's going to go to Dolores is you know, nice thing. Yeah, and it's just like why are you allowing someone talk? So badly about a friend that you've had for over 20 years talk about about Margaret. Like I just it just doesn't make any sense. You know why I feel like Dolores and Teresa's relationship is kind of like kind of off. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like they've been friends for so long that Teresa kind of feels obligated to still hang with her. Yeah, but she doesn't really like Charles much love when she's around people. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Yeah interesting.  It goes on between those it is interesting what FC definitely agrees that Danielle's face is a absurdly plump. Excuse me. Yeah. No absolutely look like these microphones who just likes and that she looks past spray-painted. Yeah, Charlie and charge also he brought it something that I forgot to write down. But Danielle saying that Melissa has zero row relevancy outside of Theresa. He thinks is true.  True that Melissa started speaking up for herself and speaking truth this season. Well, what about I mean her her store that she has and she's a mom. She's got a bit. I think she's relevant. I think Melissa, I definitely think she's relevant and she's fun. She has great funny holidays anyone else relevant. You know what? I mean? That doesn't make sense. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I and I don't like people coming from Alyssa and that way like she's so nice. She's so nice and I  I feel like people say that because they're such Teresa stands. Yeah, you know and it's just like they would do anything to like tear someone else down that might shine a light away from Teresa. And I think that's what Melissa does like. She's so likable people care about her and she's funny her husband's funny like he is kind of taking that Spotlight away from Teresa. Not even trying. Yeah, and that's People's First like line of defense as well. She wouldn't be nothing without Theresa. Yeah who gives a f to yes, she would like I would rather watch a show.  Show with Melissa and Margaret and Jennifer and Jackie then with Teresa like just makes it so nasty and negative sometimes, you know reason or head pretty well. Yeah, and her head is definitely blowing up. All right, it's just like it's exploding is this new Independence this new whatever it is. It's talking about people like yeah, she wouldn't be anything without you. Yeah, and she talks about she talks so highly or negatively about Jackie and her fear. Yeah her relationship with her sister a lot. Like that's what  Is our that's what Daniel is doing it like even when she doesn't see it. Even when Danielle or when I got brought up or whatever like through so it's kind of like she kind of grand it was like yeah, that's mrs. Points were so spot-on so spot on. So yeah, I'm getting to that we that we do the whole flashback about the women fighting Danielle and whatnot. And then the Cabo incident the last night in Cabo the glass getting thrown on on Danielle the broken glass stem like all of that the  As Enos that we loved that like I almost had a heart attack from because it's a fabulous but you know what Teresa Melissa calls Teresa hypocrite and it's yeah, it's true. Yeah and the life and the way in which he articulated. It was like amazing. Teresa had really no come back for it. Yeah, which like the points were perfect because they both the Situation's matchup. You know what I mean? The tea was just started talking about Joe and I like what are you talking about? Yeah that have to do with it.  Back, you know, it's like everything happens. My husband's in jail. Woe is me. I have no husband like you don't care. I'm sorry, but we like we don't see you. We don't see driving a prison with her visiting him and we don't see any of those things. Like we all see this is not an excuse. It's not it's not, you know, like life goes on and it happened and you not defending Melissa and that moment as nothing to do and not a thing and I loved him less. It was like, oh poor me my dad died 17 and bull bleep. Yeah one.  It has nothing to do with the other like get over. It was a valid point even Andy was like perfect sense. It was so frustrating. It's just like I really hope to raise it turns a new Leaf. I hope she gets it but you stopped hanging out in yellow. That's the main problem. Yeah. Yeah, then Yellen her fans Danielle and Teresa's fan question for you guys.  Someone in the pool worse than shoving a broken wine stem glass in someone's face. No, but Weinstein glasses worse. I think they're both equally dangerous because clearly you can get cut really bad. But if last falling in a fault, no, I mean that you can slip wrong and hit your head on something like that out of the pool like things can go wrong. Yeah, I guess so but it's like it's like it's like pushing someone standing up. So it's pulling a nice kind of like if it's a shallow. It's a shame.  Uh, yeah shallow end and they fall wrong. They can like break an ankle. That shank is way worse. When I first saw them push Marty into the pool. I did not once think oh my God, is he going to get hurt? Like that wasn't my first I don't know like maybe because I've always been around pool. Like I just said wasn't like, oh my God. I hope you can swim like that wasn't what my thought process was. But with like Jennifer breaking a glass and like shut like put it on someone's face. It's like what the hell is wrong with you like that's inspiring.  And Theresa Wes and what they were on opposite sides of the table, which is a dumb thing to say, but like even if you throw a glass at somebody that can still hurt let us their Haka should just start glasses shattering around like and step on it and cut your foot. Exactly. Yeah. Like I just like the their whole like that side of the couch is whole like reasoning behind it. Like kind of blew my mind. I was like you guys are so like lot like it's lost upon me an affiliate awkward to you can tell they're talking about like, oh is this worse than this? Yeah it what  Like I don't know and and the point being to is just like yeah if Jackie did that to Teresa and Melissa was like like, oh are you? Okay. Oh, yeah that crazy. Teresa would be pissed the F off. Yeah. Exactly. There's no sun would be so mad. If the roles were flip even like imagine someone pulling a little shank out on tour. He's not shake. You know what I mean? Yeah, I caught on Teresa and she's been in prison. She could probably handle it, right.  Yeah, I don't know. I just it just I couldn't but you know, we and that whole little irritating blessed debacle. Yes. Thank you. I couldn't I couldn't find a word to say the word for thank you. Um, what's a little present from Danielle? I don't she was that and then she had another one after it is like what is going on? Well, that was from Genoa. Yeah.  Teresa, apparently I heard someone say it's her birthday was joking. No, I think they were kidding. Yeah, like that's why it yeah. Hahaha. This is why she's getting gifts is her birthday, but not really their kidding. I don't know I that necklace is creepy and she's wearing one. It doesn't she was already aware. That was weird. She said something about we're friends forever. Yeah that's races like thanks. It was weird and it was like  I don't know. It's just it was very strange and then it was so unexpected. Yeah, and just like what like is this come in? Where is this coming from? And why and I loved how Jackie was like her but her nose is brown. Like she's totally like being a brown noser in this moment. That was the whole weird. It was a super uncomfortable. And then also when they're like, oh, so you're going to call me and Melissa lesbians for being friends with your gift in front of Tiffany's necklace like and if the are relevancy is too  He said yeah, that's so hard to buy her friends exactly if she was not friends with Teresa. She would not be on the show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she might be a vlog for Banning prostitution whore exactly does the only reason why she's back on the show and she is holding onto it and creating storylines for herself and marrying men doing stupid relevant is so why it's know these guys always easy in the relation, which is who she is.  I know I can't I can't and then Jennifer also gives her a gift. I thought that was weird too. What was her gift again?  I should go. I mean maybe that's that's weird too. But do you hey, I found it to be all very strange. I felt to be like all very awkward and like ass-kissing. Yeah. I'm just like sighs like awkward about it. Yeah, and I also just going to play to whatever you want like what Teresa especially things like this is my show. Yeah want to be here. You have to be nice to me and gifts and like that's what they were doing. I was like, this is pathetic. This is pathetic, but I hate people who are like this they'll try and so on. Yeah. Okay well,  Dolores is joke about Danielle and her not being friends anymore. You could she's like, well, you could still keep the necklace. There's a d on it. So I don't like I felt bad for Danielle at times like that. I felt bad in that it was funny because Daniela once again had no come back. Yeah. Imagine you give a gift. I don't know. I just felt bad for her. I would feel bad towards I gave somebody a gift. I know she deserves.  All she brought it upon herself, but it did end with a very cute and sweet gift. I actually love this and I almost started to cry. I love Andi, like I feel like and is so have you insulted you is so happy. So Joe comes around with a little mini Mercedes for baby Benjamin and then they have em, and then they yeah, I left them from Little AC and then they then they had  like a cute little like Jersey Adidas track that was cute. I don't know why I thought they were bringing him a puppy because I've when Joe was like one minute around I couldn't see you and you really should look like it was bringing a dog out and then it was a car. I thought it was the cutest. I thought it was a cute as I thought was really sweet. It made me really happy and they're a little like little tidbits of advice for him. But good dad and whatnot was also very like touching. All right. So yeah, I mean you could tell like  I feel like Housewives get a really bad rap and sometimes Andy like people bash him for saying he exploit swimmin and I made some in a negative way but like moments like this and like even throughout the season when we see Dolores and her charity event marketing what she's doing like you see Melissa, like trying to break gender roles with her daughter like you see all these like great things about these women making a change and how they're so grateful to Andy for giving them this platform like you could tell that they genuinely care about him and I think that's really great.  How awesome would it be? I mean boss baby should have been yeah. Yeah, and it's because they love him and I love Rose a and dancing on tables, you know exactly who doesn't. Yeah. I just I thought it was a really great way to end the reunions on such a like cute sweet high note so loved it loved it loved it. But let's get back in the dirt with our table flipping moments of the night.  Flip that table girl. Um Angel as your last table flipping mom and I would say my favorite and I don't even like no because there was so many good points. I love the the argument between Melissa and Teresa where she's like making these valid points and Teresa still like Danielle is like that to every time they tell her something like she has no come back. She's like, I like those little moments. Yeah. Yeah.  All right, I'm gonna go for one Margaret when at Danielle with all those nasty facts. Yeah book. Yeah, that's mine. I  I mean, I don't know. I think those are both like those are obviously that to biggest one. Yeah, I'll give it to Margaret because I think Melissa's been pretty consistent this whole reunions with like getting at Teresa like really like Twisted the knife tonight, but Margaret getting in on Danielle was something that I think I've been waiting for all season long and I feel like our consensus and like will say this really quickly before we go into news and gossip but our consensus of the like  Table flipping moment of the season. I think I know what I would say. What would you guys the whole entire time the entire season? It just came to me as yours Marty and Joe the pool. No, I love which one and the Mexican the Bimini in Bimini. Okay. Okay. We're about to go to blows. Yeah. Okay, that's because that's like the pivotal moment. That's what this whole season was pretty much about like it towards the end. Okay? Okay Daniel problems. Okay, that's yours. I don't.  I love is Jennifer breaking the glass Melissa coming around the table. You got the wrong, ethane girl, and that's the people flipping mama. That's mine. Yeah, I've never seen myself like that. I guess our old dinner that whole interaction Margaret like there's a whole series of events when I was I literally like almost fell out of my seat like you were there I was so ever you were like to really like you super into the fight in Bimini to and Bimini not as much as this like this was really good.  The monkey but lips to was pretty oh, yeah that one. Yeah. Well that was this it was that what was that that was around every dinner and Mexico was horrible, but that was that was a fun trip. Yeah this trip first dinner first today. I want to see this is the best season ever great season. Yeah, really good comparable to when Melissa and Joe first got on the shop. It really was it was a great season, but  let's jump into our last news and gossip of the of the season of I flew by so fast first things first. We got our girl Teresa and her boy juicy Joe 91x boy ex-boy. Juicy, Joe because she chooses he definitely is Juicy. He Teresa is reportedly planning to file for divorce very soon according to multiple reports.  Officers in New Jersey star hasn't visited her husband, Joe who's serving? A 41-month prison prison sentence for fraud then a quote really long time in quote and believes. He won't be able to stop his deportation back to Italy wait. I thought it was a get out recently. He supposed to get out like early this month. Yeah, but yeah, they haven't heard anything about the appeal process or anything like that. Theresa hasn't visited Jody really long time a source tells hollywoodlife.com has really busy.  E with her life and kids and it's always been important to her to keep her kids lives as normal as possible and she feels it's important for them to see their dad. But he lives very far away fortunately for Joe Teresa. Well Teresa stays away from visiting him. His family has been bringing his daughters to visit him on weekends. So the girls are still seeing him. But Teresa is like Boy by so yeah, she's definitely buoyed by because if you can go to Bimini and you can go to all these chips. Oh, yeah, like everywhere else that they have.  This season but you can't take your kids to go see him. Y'all are definitely like going our separate ways. Yeah. Yeah sucks. That's so sad, but not really did it to himself and oh you have such a soft heart like for Danielle Poor Joe. No, I do. Look she's so nice. Wow. Okay, well onto our girl Danielle. So as I mentioned earlier in the show Danielle obviously felt from divorce with Marty a couple days later. She is in  the Caribbean with this guy and day after that. They're reportedly engaged on a Friday said they're going to get married on a Monday that wedding got called off because apparently her daughter's did not like that and then it was reported that they broke up they broke up so much to unpack here. Wow a day after the news broke of a breakup between Danielle and her fiancé Oliver mayor who is some type of royalty somehow.  Dutch he's a Dutch. Yeah, so she would be a duchess Danielle is denying a split and a bizarre video posted on her Instagram page. If you recall Danielle and Oliver got engaged last week and plan to get married this previous Monday. I'm a fourth however over the weekend a couple postponed their wedding which was followed up by report yesterday and which multiple sources revealed that they have called it quits. However, Danielle today who's 56 years old took to her Instagram story to deny any breakup as she appeared to be in a rather.  Strange video with Oliver to correct the rumors that way that he and I are not together here. I am with my love Danielle could be seen saying that as she planted a kiss on Oliver Oliver looking seemingly out of it then proceeded to say I love you to his fiancee. So that's what happened. I like Okay. So this was what I was getting at with her moving on so quickly from her divorce with Marty. This man has money and can pay for  This how to get her out of I see what you're saying. So that is a good night. Why would someone who's like royalty though wanna deal with someone like her she doesn't carry herself in a classy manner. She like like Joe Gorga says, she must have a magical vagina. I mean, I'm sure lots of women don't know. I don't know. I think she's strange looking and crazy, but I ain't your son some men like that, right?  Early on to something that I think will be really great. Um, let's push Danielle out of the Real Housewives of New Jersey and bring back a fan. Favorite Caroline Manzo. Oh, no way really according to a new report Andy Cohen would love to welcome Caroline back to the show and is hoping to convince her to return to the Bravo TV reality series six years after she's called it quits. It's been a while. We haven't Caroline in a long time and he apparently has called Caroline so many times trying to get her.  Back on the show and said a revealed to radar online. He calls her husband to he's pushing really hard to have her come back. She's expressed in the past that she has no interest on returning apparently didn't ERM. Sorry Teresa. Also, is it really into it? But she is still Theresa's still very good friends with Caroline sister Dina. Yeah, but yeah, but her back Dina lives in La she could be on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills - Oh just be on the panel next season. Yeah apparently.  Really Dina and Caroline still haven't been speaking. So it's it's I think it's a long shot. But I would love to have Caroline come back and I'm just one phase out crazy-ass Danielle. Yeah, we're going both back. I mean Danielle is crazy, but I think she's also good for reading so I honestly don't want to see Danielle go just tired of her. She's crazy. Yeah, but that's it's good. That's bad man all back. Well, I mean, I guess we don't need her like I'll get my Danielle, you know decompressing since the shows.  No. Yeah, but I mean, I don't think that's enough time to decompress them. They don't stop. This is true. This is true. I'm you guys it was so much fun. I know it was a fun season. Yeah so much fun. I feel like we've bonded in a way that is not a good time breakable. I think we have an unbreakable Bond now. Yeah forever. Oh, we should have got a necklace I did. Okay. That's what I wanted.

episode 7 Baseline self-care  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dream. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self-awareness along the way.  Hey everyone, welcome back. I'm really excited to talk to you about this one today. I've been hearing from a lot of you newlyweds out there. So I know a big part of the people who listen are people who either been married for longer than one year or people who are still dating or not even dating right now. Also, I you know, I have to say as much as I'm loving hearing from how this material is impacting people in all different.  In stages, you know, I've got a soft spot for my newlyweds. So this is one that I really wish someone had sat me down and told me when I was first married. So this is definitely useful for anyone at any stage. I guess. This is just that's the phase where I needed it the most and that's the phase where I learned the hard way. So we're talking today about Baseline self-care. So again, I really wish I'd known this one earlier probably took me a few years of marriage to figure this out and  and I'm sure there are people out there who are more I guess sort of Taipei organized structured. I love to be spontaneous. I love staying up late. I just think there's like almost nothing as much fun as staying up later than you're supposed to. I'm basically still a kid. I like being active and doing things and all that and the truth is that my marriage was really paying the price for it at the beginning, but it was such a simple.  Because the problem was I needed more sleep different people react differently when they don't get enough sleep, but for me, it came across as again. Like I keep saying what's holding you back from showing up is your best self in your marriage? Well not getting enough sleep will definitely top that list. In fact, I actually say to people I want you to know that you have my permission to go to bed. Angry anyone who  I grew up with that thought that like it's really romantic and sweet to commit to your partner that you'll never go to bed angry. No, sorry disagree 100% go to bed with some statement of hope for resolution go to bed with a promise of dealing with it in the morning. But if you are angry and tired, you are not about to find a solution to your problem. You're just about to make it worse and you're probably going to end up saying something that you're going to regret. So if you are exhausted and you're fighting with your spouse,  My suggestion is you look them right in the eye and you say sweetie. I love you. I don't think that my brain can handle this conversation right now because I'm so tired. I want to do my very best to resolve this problem and I can't do it right now. So I want to go to sleep and in the morning we're going to discuss it and I'm going to have so many more ideas and so much more creativity to fix this problem. I'm telling you it's not something that people are like your spouse is going to be thrilled but really will see the wisdom.  Come in and it will make your life a million times easier. So again everyone reacts differently when they go don't get enough sleep for me. It would be my patience is out the window. My creativity is out the window. I don't come up with new ideas. I don't have a sense of humor. Really. I'm really a troll but I don't get enough sleep. I'm just no fun to be around and and what I've started to realize I am not having fun, right? So that's actually what gets me the bed as somebody who loves staying up late is  Realizing that the whole next day. I'm not going to be having any fun. If I don't get enough sleep. Now. There are those unicorns out there who manage their lives on five or six hours of sleep or four or five hours of sleep and they seem to be fine and there's phases where you're just not going to get enough right but prioritizing this to in my mind is really important and again, it could just be that I'm one of the people that really suffers when they don't get enough, but I did  I do see that most people when they're getting enough sleep and whatever enough is for you in your stage. It's that point at which you feel like yourself again, but when you're really running on empty and you're running on caffeine and you're running on sugar and whatever it takes to keep you going because you're not taking care of yourself physically that is not you that is like zombie you and ZombiU is not the person your spouse married. So it's not very nice to show up. That way. I really love doing that higher-level thought work, but it's also really important to pay.  attention to this Baseline level of self-care because it's really hard to do the thought work you can you can do thought work about being tired and I think it's really important to know that you can experience life tired and cranky and what does that look like and not to fight that but just really experience it and be open to what that looks like and feels like butt  Sometimes it's just more efficient to go take a nap and fix the problem. What I teach my clients is the idea of the 10 second check in because sometimes it's not sleep right? Sometimes you're just spinning and you don't know what it is. The first thing to do when you feel like you are in crisis mode is to grab yourself 10 seconds, and this could literally be in the middle of a conversation. Someone's talking to you. I don't care if you need this you take it and you just close your eyes or you look down at the floor, whatever you need to do. You are not looking at a phone you are not looking at us.  Green if you're at work, and you can't get up just look at your keyboard, but don't be looking at a screen and you start at the top of your head and you literally scan through your body. Give yourself 10 seconds when you get to your mouth. You think am I thirsty when you get to your head, I'm going backwards. Are you think do I have a headache? Right what just check in? What is going on with my head right now physically am I thirsty? Am I hungry? When's the last time I ate do I need to go to the bathroom, by the way, it could be that some of  the guys have less of a problem with this if you have learned anything from Alison Armstrong, she talks extensively about how women tend to be much less in touch with their physical bodies and their physical needs than men are and we tend to just keep having urgent tasks come up and we push everything off. I'll eat later. I'll go to the bathroom later. I'll take a nap later where sometimes men can just be much more sort of self-sufficient and taking care of their physical needs. I actually see that that contrast comes up very interesting lie with newlyweds.  Is you know a woman will be struggling with something and she's putting off all her needs and then her husband will just drop everything and go to the fridge and open it and get something to eat. And she's like, why aren't you suffering like me? Like, it just doesn't make any sense but understanding that that's just a difference in the way the two genders can function and again everyone's on a spectrum and I might not be exactly true for your couple but you'll see in our cases is definitely the case. So we fit this particular this particular, you know, male-female dynamic that anyway, so getting back to it. So if it  Could be that this is something that's that more women are going to relate to than the men but it's worthwhile for everybody. If you're feeling like you're in crisis mode, you just close your eyes or you look down and you literally scan from the top to the bottom of your body and just check in what physically needs to be taken care of right now and you might find that you are totally exhausted. You might find that you're thirsty my mother shared with me and I really wish that if anybody here has seen this if it's a quote, I don't know. She said she saw it on like a post on social media and I thought it was so amazing. So I  My guess is it's probably a quote. It said something along the lines of you know, sometimes I think that I need to turn my entire life upside down. But all I really need is a glass of water right? So sometimes I totally relate to this right like if my house is going crazy and it's Bonkers and it's what we call the Lovin Family Circus and everyone screaming and there's laundry all over the floor and there's dirty dishes stacked up. I'm like, if only we had a dog like really I'm like, how can I change my life? Maybe we should move to, California?  Yeah, like whatever it is. I just I'm like, I'm not even willing to deal with what's in front of me. So I'm like, let's just change everything right and so it's fine when it's kind of in that crazy fantasy level but when it gets dangerous is when you know, there's overwhelm or there's physical struggle because of exhaustion or because you're starving and then something little goes on with your spouse and you're like, oh my gosh, I don't think this relationship works. That's that now you're dealing in a totally different level, right? And  What you actually need is an app. You don't need to be dealing with the thought right now about whether your relationship is working or not. This is not a thought issue. This is a physical issue go take a nap. Okay. I hope I'm kind of explaining this all clearly. So that's how you do the 10-second check-in. And so what's going to happen for you is you're going to start to notice the difference between when your needs are self care needs and I mean physical self care we talk in my course a lot more about self-care and a higher level, but I'm just talking about Baseline.  Fine self care. Okay. That's your physical body's needs at the moment. So you're going to start to be able to tell the difference between your Baseline self care needs and your thought work needs meaning you'll be in a situation and you'll be experiencing negative emotion frustration resentment anger whatever or you're just not getting whatever result in your life that you're looking for. And you're going to start to notice is this happening because I need to do my thought.  Need to do myself coaching. And if you haven't heard those podcasts go back a little bit to earlier podcast and you'll be able to get a little bit more of what that self coaching. Looks like I talked about it quite a bit in the Mother-in-law episode or when what you really need is the self-care need you're going to be able to sort of identify that really quickly and the 10-second check-in will help you with that because if you do the 10 second check in and you're fine or you identify a need and you take care of it, and now you're fine and you're still struggling with the situation, so now it's a good time to move on to your thought work.  Okay, so let me just give you an example of what that looks like for me. So self care needs what that looks like for me. What I notice is kind of a racing feeling thoughts flying through my head. I don't really know where they're coming from. A lot of I can't do this. It's too much. I'm overwhelmed like a lot of overwhelm confusion. Like I don't know what to do next. I don't really know what I'm even doing right now complete lack of focus now could those things be feelings that are created by a certain thought. Yes.  But when I identify them that tends to be the cause of not enough sleep or not enough food, right? And so my body is sort of like keeping me from being able to engage in anything because it's not properly fueled. So that's why I end up with kind of this blur right like my day goes by in a blur. So that would be my situation where I'm going to look and see you know, what can I do to take care of my physical needs at the moment now thought work needs really have a different flavor to them for me and again,  They're going to be different for you. But the more the you start to do that 10 second check-ins, you can start to categorize. You're really going to start to see the difference. So you're going to know sort of where to jump to here are some things I do and I know these are red flags for me that it's time to run a model really you can run a model anytime you want and the more models you run the better. You'll get it with this work, but I know it's time to run a model when I'm trying to convince myself of something right. I'm trying to convince myself that that person was wrong.  Or that my situation is bad or that this person has done something to me or that I'm upset. Like if I'm trying to sort of like I'm rehashing the thought over and over and I'm adding drama and you know adjectives to the whole situation. I'm reprocessing and I'm just sort of it's almost like I'm digging myself into the feeling right I'm digging myself into my righteous indignation. That is a red flag for Thought work. That's usually not needing an app that's usually stopping and saying,  Oh, whoa, whatever thought I'm getting really excited about here.  Doesn't matter if it's true or if it's false, is it helpful? Okay, I could spend a lot of time being frustrated over, you know Injustice in the government. Is that helpful to me, right?  Doesn't mean that I don't ever do anything about it. And if that's something that Spurs me into positive action, and I'm happy with that great. But if I'm not planning on doing anything about it how much time do I want to spend their? It could even be things that feel really righteous to feel worried about if I'm agonizing over one of my friends and her situation in life and how terrible it is and how I don't think she's going to be okay and maybe they're going to get divorced or maybe their kids not going to be. All right if this Spurs me into  Of action. This is a great place to spend my time. If this is just completely blocking me from living my life. It doesn't matter if the Situation's true or not. It doesn't matter if the thought is true or not. It's not helpful and I need to find a different one. Okay, and then the last one is at the same. Sometimes it's not like an extended time with one thought or one feeling. Sometimes it's the same issue coming up repeatedly now the issue will often look like another person whenever this person comes in the room. I'm upset, right so  It starts to feel like this person is my problem. Let me avoid this proper person or let me change those person. And unfortunately, for those of you who have lived in the world of reality for any period of time you've already found out the bad news. You can't change other people even though this problem keeps coming up when the person enters the room. That's just because you have a thought about that person. It's not about that person at all. And again, you've definitely experienced this at some point in your life. Where you  And up here had totally different feelings about somebody right could be they walked in the room and they got all charged and upset and you just didn't care right or vice versa. When you see the same issue keeps coming up or maybe it's an issue of like you're always late for work and then you totally anxious and overwhelmed or maybe it's an issue of every time you try to budget. You just can't get yourself to look at your bank account. Whatever the thing is if it's coming up repeatedly, that's a thought work issue.  I had a really funny like very run-of-the-mill thought work problem. So I'll just share that with you as an ending to just kind of give you an idea of how this all works out recently. So I realized that I had a thought that adult laundry is a lot harder than child laundry, right? We have four kids, but they're all small. And so my thought was that, you know, kick closer cute and you feel like very maternal when you're taking care of their clothes and your folding them and your  It's like a nice process and I've like pretty little bins for all my kids and like they're all color-coded and I don't love doing laundry. But you know, I feel like there's some kind of benefit when I'm doing the kids laundry, but adult laundry forget it. There's so much of it. It's complicated to put away. You know, it's always like, you know has to be sorted out more than the kids stuff. You can't just throw it in. You know, it's just a lot more work. It's so much harder.  And then I realized wait that's actually not objectively true. Right I could probably find someone who thinks the opposite and by the way, I found out later my husband literally thinks the opposite. He thinks kid closer completely overwhelming. They're so small takes forever to fold them and he never knows what goes where so and he's like, you know adult clothes, you know, just take a shirt and like half the loads done because our shirts are so big so I could have just asked him but instead I did that work. So I wanted to find out what my result was and I was shocked by how  Much I had proved myself, correct, right what had I done? So I had a thought that adult laundry is a lot harder than kid laundry.  That made me feel like very whatever the opposite of like motivated I guess unmotivated right extremely unmotivated D energized overwhelmed not exactly resentful, but just kind of like cranky about the whole thing about having to do it. And so what actions did I take now? This is amazing. My kids got like really cute color coded baskets from Target that I love they all wear matching each other, but they each other on color and it's really sweet and I can line them up. What did I do for us? I want  Amazon and I just ordered the first thing that I found its way too big. It doesn't match our room. We have this ugly hamper in our room, right and because it's so enormous and because I have this thought that adult laundry is really hard. I always procrastinate our laundry. I'll always do the kids laundry's first which means it on busy weeks I end up with two loads of laundry for us because I didn't, you know on a busy week. I'll miss our laundry because I did all their laundry first.  So this was really interesting because I actually made our laundry a lot harder. I bought a huge hamper that doesn't really get noticed until it's full which is already like five times more full than their hampers. It's not like cute or enjoyable. I didn't buy something that I liked that did a brought me any kind of like visual enjoyment while I'm taking care of it and I'm always doing there's first which means that there's just smaller amounts. I have that satisfaction of finishing the job with the kids that I never get with ours. So that's just an example of how when we have that thought and then as soon as I can switch that  So our laundry is easy to put away, you know, I even put the towels in with are sometimes so like it's very fast to fold and then you can just Tick Tock get it done and you could have completely different response. So again, this is just an example for me. I know a lot of you don't have four kids or more and I know a lot of you it could be the husband or you share the laundry Duty in our house. That's how we divided things. That's fine with me, but I did want to just share that example as a way of looking at  How sometimes that thought work need can really make your life easier, right? This wasn't a dramatic horrible thing going wrong in my life, right? It was just an annoyance in my life. But looking into the thought work. I haven't yet done my new model of where how I want to feel about the laundry, but really just noticing that so much it happened because I just had been really invested in this thought that adult laundry is objectively so much harder, when really that was just my interpretation. It's amazing to see how much evidence your brain can get for it and how you actually start.  Take action about it being hard. You know, my coach says that money is fun and easy. I know a lot of people who don't feel that money is fun and easy, but I love thinking about what that does for her.  How does she show up differently in the world because she thinks money is fun and easy. How does she manage her budgeting? How does she manage her purchases the totally different situation? Okay, so quick recap for today. So you always get homework. Here's your homework. So I want you to try this 10 second check at next time that you're feeling a lot of negative emotion or overwhelm or just lack of focus stop and do a 10-second check-in. It could be that you're already like deep into social media or like zoning out on your computer when you notice this  That's a good indication that maybe you're not feeling a hundred percent. So just close your computer put away your phone whatever you need to do. Close your eyes and do that physical scan to see how you're physically feeling remember that sometimes you can do a there's just a quick fix. There's a physical fix to the problem and it's great to get that in first because then you're just showing up a lot better. It's a lot easier to find Solutions. It's a lot easier to be creative when like you're well rested or you're fed, whatever you need, right and then when that 10  And check-in doesn't bring up anything for you or brings up something that you can quickly fix and then you still don't feel good. Now. It's time to figure out what you're thinking that's causing the problem. Right? What's that? Thought that you're having and if you can't think of the thoughts start by articulating your feeling. Okay. And right now I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious. Okay. Wait, so why would I be feeling overwhelmed and anxious right? Then you go backwards again. I talked about this a lot in the Mother-in-law episodes. If you want to go back to that one. I think it's episode 3 and then you can  Also reach out to me. If you want Instagram at first you're married if you want to share some of your models with me, and sort of let me in on your process. I'd love to hear from you. All right, so thank you so much for tuning in this week. I hope you have a wonderful week and I will speak to you again very soon.
Hello. Hello everyone. What is up? Welcome back to the Gen Z girl podcast. My name is Abby. Auslan. I am the host. It is 9:00 10:00 on Sunday night right now. So it's about 12 hours away from most of you guys hearing this and I definitely procrastinated recording this episode definitely had good intentions of getting it done early, but I contracted mono last week or at the beginning of last week and I've pretty much just been absolutely on my bed. The past couple days so it's just been a rough time and I'm finally just getting around to recording this episode. But I just wanted to quickly plug the Gen Z girl podcast Facebook group. It is a private Facebook group and I will always leave it linked in the show notes. And if you just search the Gen Z girl podcast group on Facebook, you should be able to find it and just answer a few brief easy questions about the podcast so that you guys can join it. I asked you guys on there which topic you guys wanted to hear next and  And definitely by far all of you guys wanted to hear a podcast with my boyfriend. So that is what we are doing today. There's also a Instagram page for the podcast and it's just Gingy the Gen Z girl, but actually I don't even know what it is. Let me check because I forget. Yeah, it's just gen Z girl podcast on Instagram and that is also in the show notes. So that is that but I guess I'll give you guys a brief introduction to Griffin who was my boyfriend of two years on Wednesday. So two days,  Guys here in this will be celebrating our two year anniversary and unable to kiss each other on the lips because I'm sick and probably won't be able to kiss you on the lips for another two months. So very sorry for depriving you of that. But I guess you can give a little introduction of yourself. Hey guys, if you don't know me, I'm Griffin. I'm a senior at the University of Alabama. I'm sick as well. Look ma. No though. How Amano know?  majoring in accounting  Fun fact fun fact, well, I'm from Houston. It is very important. It's an identifying part of Griffin's personality. Fun fact, I know I'm for you I was gonna say your fun facts should be that you went surfing for the first time and you were scared of water and you want cliff jumping yesterday and Tuscaloosa all in one month and that is huge for you. Yeah. They're my family is going to end up dragging.  Into the water just because it's a big part of my family. So sorry about that one, but well besides the fact that you told me there was a shart next to me while I was doing it at least yeah Lisa told you after bag and you're fine. So everything's fine. No reason to be worried. Yeah. So Griffin and I were just I had you guys ask me questions on the Instagram page for the podcast. So if you guys want to participate in any of those definitely follow the Instagram page as well as join the Facebook group because  that's where you guys can participate in asking questions. And this episode's mainly primarily going to be question based off of you guys questions about going to structure it based off of what questions are relevant to beginning of mine and Griffin's relationship the middle and then the end because we're going to kind of walk through our relationship and things we've been through things we've learned and then answer your questions along the way that like makes sense with that if that makes sense, but just a quick little weak recap because man. Oh man, it's been a who week I said, I got mono which  It's not to the doctor on Thursday and found that out and Thursday night. I also found out graph and I have another little friend is living not living but intruding in our home if you guys watch my YouTube videos, which if you don't feel things us and you don't know I also have a YouTube channel and a lot of you guys probably know Griffin from there which is why this episode was probably so highly requested but beginning of the Seer like two weeks after I moved into our house. We had a big old.  Rat join our home underneath our sink and some other little areas of the house Rhonda. Rhonda was a name. Okay. Yeah, we're like humanizing these routes and I don't know why because I'm not a fan. But anyways, we had another one this week. I thought I heard one on Tuesday and I Griffin I both convinced ourselves. That was the ice maker in the kitchen. No. No, I knew oh you knew. Yeah, but he was he in my best interest. He wasn't telling me what was going on just because  Last time it like gave me extreme stress and anxiety because I just don't like feeling invaded and they're gross and carry diseases and stuff. So it's just kind of gross. But anyways that happened this week. We had another one even though last time the exterminators came and we're supposed to move and we also had a ton of work done on the house through our landlords who prevent this from happening again, and it happened again, like month and a half later. So yeah, I was dealing with mono and that at the same time as  Well as just I have to test on Tuesday and a quiz tomorrow, so it was just really bad timing and then our or my brother and his wife and two of their friends came from Houston this weekend for the Tennessee game, but I'll get into that later in the goals and gratitude, but I'm going to start off with a quote as usual. That was just kind of our weekly recap. I like doing that just so you guys can kind of understand, you know a why I may sound a little bit lower energy in the  So just because of mono and everything. But anyways, the quote is a secret to happiness as letting every situation be what it is instead of what you think. It should be and make the best of it. So I really really love this quote. I don't want to do your traditional usual cheesy relationship quote just because I think there's other ways to provide value about relationships than those quotes, but I think that this quotes so great because I really think that you can rob yourself of your happiness if  If you have really high expectations for yourself or your partner that aren't exactly realistic or attainable because then you're constantly your standard is those expectations and it's fine to have standards but having ridiculous expectations for every situation ends up leading you to always be discontent with your relationship and what's going on in it when instead you can just let things be the way they are and make the best of this situation. So I really like  Quotes, what do you think of it? Graph like that? Quote Yeah, I guess no like it's it's not a huge quote guy or anything, but I agree with it. I think that it'll better our relationship. Honestly. I think I think we sometimes get held up in expectations. I know I always used to be that girl. That would be like, oh my gosh, like whenever I would see someone get flowers in a relationship. I would just be like  like wow, I didn't get flowers. I expect my boyfriend to get me flowers all the time. But I think that that's just unrealistic because not every guy is a flower guy and I'm honestly not even that big of a flower girl like yes, I do really appreciate them. But I feel like if I got them all the time, I just be kind of like well whatever, you know, sort of other little things, you know, it doesn't have to be what other people's relationships are doing your expectation that that's exactly the point. I'll try to make the expectations you have for your relationship in yourself should never be what some  Else or another relationship is doing it should all be you know, something based on the relationship. You're in not the relationship someone else's in so that's why the whole flower thing always just messed me up because I would make myself disappointed that my boyfriend wasn't getting me flowers or something. But there was other things he did like make me to you when I'm sick or massage my feet because they hurt even when my feet are dirty, you know, things like that. I guess now we can get into the goals and gratitude only I was just saying what happened? Oh God, no just because  Like that's why I used to be I get I still kind of a.m. But I'm getting over it. I'm like I was a big what if guy and stuff like that and I never really let situations playing out in my mind. It was just kind of I always thought of them going the bad way never the good way and stuff like that. But we're a be obviously he's saying the quote she has makes a lot of sense. That would be one of them. Yeah make the most of it and nothing it's one reason like you talking about  Wires and stuff my way of doing stuff or like doing kind of like a flower thing instead of getting flowers because like I'm not a huge flower guy I get like whenever we get each other gifts and stuff like that. I always have at least one kind of cheesy gift. Oh, yeah something sentimental and I love that stuff. So that's just me. But yeah, I love that. So goals and gratitude my goal for this week is dressed as much as I can since the only known cure or helper from on, OA  Oh is rest and hydration and my to test on Tuesday? I really want to make good grades on them. But considering I've hardly started studying for them. I don't know how that's going to go. And I know that I probably shouldn't even be going to my classes, but I don't really know how to go about doing that because I don't want to get so behind to where I have to play catch-up around the time of finals just because of the time of week and like here it is and everything and I really don't want to procrastinate on my YouTube work because I have been doing that and it's  Cause me to upload so out of order lately. Like I think my last five videos have been completely out of order. My next two are going to be too just because I can't edit my videos fast enough to where my sponsor content goes up after like the videos before it. So I've just been uploading that my sponsor content when it needs to go up and then all the other non sponsor content gets like offer not a whack and I really hate that because it's just like annoying to see things really out of time order. That's just a really little thing but I just need to be better about staying on top of it this week. So that's definitely a goal.  Oh and then my gratitude for this week is pretty simple. We finally had a night game at Alabama and it was incredible because we have the new red LED lights and go check out my I guess since latest Instagram picture and then on my tide highlight Instagram highlight story you guys can see it but it was so much fun. I did go obviously despite being sick because I couldn't really like I don't want to get penalized for getting rid of my ticket and everything and then also because my brother and his wife and their friends came this weekend, so I just kind of  So like suck it up all day yesterday and do the best I could to be full of energy, but I only had like one drink in the morning and then the rest of the day I was literally chugging Pedialyte and electrolyte drinks, but my gratitude is being able to see family and friends that it was really such an awesome time with them and then the night game was so much fun because we had a night game in so long and then I'm really loving the Colder Weather. We've been having lately because I was getting really sick of the hot weather, but what's your goal and gratitude?  Or the week graph. My goal is I guess just to be able to prepare for my test on Wednesday. And then I have to the following week and stay ahead of schedule hit the stay focused at the gym every day. Sorry Ivy. I know you can't make it there with me. Did you say I guess and also get my  My voice back, but and I'm I guess gratitude.  Yeah gratitude. I'm just I guess happy to be finishing another year with their I guess being together with Abby and start we augment the say that for my until our anniversary. I can do whatever I mean, I guess I always think of my gratitude is like things from the happen like the past week, but I should also think about if you truly are  Yeah, that's like one thing that really sucks. You guys. I can't work out because I'm at risk of rupturing my spleen. I may just do like squats in my room or something and few push-ups just so I don't like lose. My I always tell you do that stuff progress. She gets sick at least like three times a month. Yeah. I don't know what's going on this year, but that's not it for me. Okay, so we're going to go ahead and roll into the meat of this podcast episode this beginning segment. We're just going to kind of walk through how we met and just  And of like where I was at when we met and just kind of that stuff and then answering questions sort of in regard to the beginning of relationships and we have answered a lot of these questions and other ways on my YouTube channel. If you guys have been a longtime subscriber, you would hear it from our boyfriend tag video that we did to vlogmas is ago and then I'm sure I know oh my gosh, and then also we did a qai beginning of last school year around like September I think of last school  So if you guys are interested in more content from eyes, especially from like us as babies and are dating phase. Those will be good videos to go back and find on my channel. I'll try and Link them in the show notes below. So that kind of stuff to know about us. Oh, yeah, so I guess we can walk through how we met. I don't know if you want me to say it because we always end up like not bickering they're always just like that's not exactly how it went. I've only met  I was at my brother's 22nd birthday party and it was like September 29th. I think or 30th. I'd have to go back to the picture of my camera roll something honor. So yeah, I was at my brother's 22nd birthday party and I got home pretty late. I think was around like 1:30 2:00 a.m. And I was walking sweet little ah, ah my lovely dog and yeah and  I was I walked out of my apartment and my neighbors who had multiple times tried to hang out with my roommate and I am like come over and just like knock on a door and ask for us to come over and hang out with them or go out with them. Whatever it was. They had definitely just bothered the living crap out of us and it's funny looking back because now there's some of our closest friends I tried one time, but they never answered. Yeah. So anyway, that might have hurt my chance. Anyways where I walked outside.  Side and a lot of times like they would they always have people over next door and they would just leave like their porch because we lived on the bottom floor of where we were at and we each had porches and they left like the door to their porch open and I'm walking by with Ella and Griffin was on the patio and Ella just like runs up to anyone. She sees because she's such a people dog and she ran up to Griffin and was like just obviously wagging her tail, you know, like trying to get pet all that stuff.  And Griffin just kind of like, you know was patting her like oh my gosh, he's so cute. And then he cited kind of walk your dog and I was just like no you can't take my dog for me and walk my dog. Who do you think you are? So I was just like you can walk my dog with me, but you can't take my dog in Walker and I think that's probably what he meant to say. Definitely what I meant to it. He just been drinking. So it was just I also saw you like before you like got up to like right there in front of the right apartment.  But like my vision was very distorted. So I like I was like and I was just going like stare and trying to like figure out who that was. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, so he has that we walked talked a little bit. He asked me that night if I whenever we got because I just like walked Ella for like three minutes. It wasn't very long. So it was just the end of the night and I got my spill out. Yeah, so then he kind of just like told me about himself or whatever and you know, I was just talking to him entertaining him and I say entertaining  you just because you were just I was like, I don't know what this guy's trying to do like and I got back to my apartment and you were like just saying by whatever nice to meet you and you asked if we could go to lunch the next day and I'm in my phone on me so that he didn't have his phone on him. So he kind of like get my phone number my name any of that any of my contact information basically, but I rejected him anyways initially just because just a little bit of background. I had literally just gotten out of a like two-year relationship.  And probably like two weeks before I think we met maybe a week before we met I think was a week or two before we met but I don't remember so I was like my mindset was you know, I am literally just going to you know, do me. I'm not going to be in relationship. I have no interest in hanging out with anyone dating anyone whatever I'm working on myself focusing on myself as most girls are when they get out of relationships, which is why you said no. Yeah and I think coming out of like rough relationships or like if they're lost  the ship didn't end. Well, you just have like a bad taste in your mouth for like men in general as a woman or a woman. Yeah. I was just kind of like I don't want I want anything to do with this like this isn't for me right now. Like I just need to focus on school. Enjoy my sophomore year whatever and I was very understanding about that. Yeah you are you were like, yeah, I get that mean we could just have a bunch of friends and I was like, no because I know where this is going. I'm I'm one persistent guy. Oh, yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah, and he ended up mess.  Me on Instagram the next day you can say this part. Okay, so basically since I didn't somehow didn't get Abby's name at all a few minutes or talking.  One of my her neighbors, which is actually one of my really good like buddies now, he watched a lot of YouTube in somehow came and passed one of her videos. It was like yo Griff. I think this is this is our neighbor and I was like no no, no because like I slept on the couch that night and I was like dude that is her because and I got her name, I found on Instagram. I DM her and I said,  Hey remember me from last night the I talk to you by any chance. Are you any good at Econ and she was a TA? Yeah, you want to explain that? Yeah, I'll explain that part. So in my head, I'm like, okay, this guy is definitely probably asking me for help with econ because we met last night and he just wants to get to know me better and I was like, honestly, I don't really have any guy friends at this University and I don't think it would do any  Time for coming out of a relationship to have a guy friend. I think it would actually be good for me and it wasn't like he was asked me to go to lunch again because if he would have done that I would be like, okay, he didn't respect it the first time you know, like leave me alone, but he asked for help with econ and if you would have asked for help on any other subject I kid you not I would have just been like no, I'm sorry, but I'm sure there's tutor somewhere else lucky guess. Yeah, but luckily for Griffin. I happened to be an econ tutor and it just started like that semester of  Me being an econ ta which is crazy to think about and I just think that all of that story I've never leave never really said the full story before just because on YouTube obviously, we're not going to sit there and talk about it for forever. But on a podcast you can and so I'm sorry if that was like your fourth time hearing that story if you know me personally or if you've watched on YouTube, hopefully you just like fast forward it so you don't have to hear it again, but I think all of that just goes to show that you hear people say this all the time but like  The best things come when you least expect them. I literally wasn't and like when you're not looking for them. So like I was not looking for a relationship. I feel like when people are in a position where they're constantly like, sir seeking out and searching for a relationship like nothing wrong with like actively dating and like trying to get to know people but I feel like the best things aren't meant to happen always happen when you're not looking because I just kind of Catch You by surprise and that's exactly kind of what happened with Griffin died. And you know, we talked and just hung out.  And we're just friends for a couple of weeks. But we've both definitely knew we were developing feelings for each other. I definitely knew what I was doing. Yes. Yeah, and on October 23rd of 2017. He asked me to be his girlfriend. So that's that story and I guess we can like kind of just go over really quickly before we answer questions how relationships was in the beginning. We had two very different backgrounds when it came to dating.  And just because I had just gotten out of like a partially long distance to your long-term relationship and I've been in other relationships than that before and you know years your situation was my situation for what like this your previous dating life, but there was nothing as serious I guess is as far as like I had gotten to level of seriousness. Oh, yeah, like I had mice it was my senior year. Yeah - like a lot of people just get in relationships or senior year just to have somebody there for all the important.  Events and stuff and it just kind of like, I don't know how I don't know. I don't know what it is. But like you'll go like all of high school, you know without like a serious relationship and so many people getting serious relationship senior year, which is just so odd because then everyone ends up like why don't you out of here? Yeah, and that's okay in the beginning. I think Griffin was very very like persistent and day.  Me he was you know, like very he wasn't he was definitely like rushing things in the sense that when I was like look we're just friends right now and I just want to take things very slowly. He was like respecting that in the sense that he was like trying to you know, obviously respect that but at the same time I could just tell he was like, you're like, oh that's like go on dates like come meet my parents like all that kind of stuff because I met his parents so early especially because it was before we even started dating. I know it was a grocery and I told my mom I was like Lissa  look, I feel really weird doing this because I'd got out of a relationship like three weeks ago and this just feels very strange because I wasn't looking for this and my mom was like, you know, if it's just a guy friend of yours, like what's the harm and trying and just trying to have a guy friend and getting to know his parents and your dad ended up being like a big influence in me ending up in Accounting. In fact, like one of the only influences so that was definitely like there for a reason. Yeah, like whether or not we in them together. He definitely helped me out with that because he  Isn't that field and he kind of like helped me decide on what I was wanting to do because at that time I was just a finance major. Anyways, that's kind of like the really beginning of our relationship grew from being being very persistent me being very kind of we switch we switch now she doesn't really like me anymore. I'm just yeah, I'm totally kidding. No, so it's just it I don't know in the beginning obviously like things are very weird cuz you're figuring each other out. I think that we definitely like in hindsight. We probably could have like slowed things down, but I think both of us were excited because we got along so well,  Well, yeah, we found someone that actually like yeah, I can I'm a person who can talk for four hours from now the first time we hung out we literally were supposed to be studying for his econ test and we studied for liver. We talked before how our strings I pulled out my spiral that's about as far as you like. And then we talked for four hours. I failed that test by with the by the way, but it was a great great. Yeah, it's all good because we study for the next one's actually and I felt really bad the first time and up fine. But anyways, I guess we will get into  Questions that you guys had for its in relation to like the beginning of relationships. I guess. The first one I want to ask is going to be for Griffin and like what tips do you have for girls that like want guys to like them and notice them like, what do you look for or what do you think makes girls stand out to you stand out I guess I should say me stand out. Yeah, that is about this way. You can for that guy.  Okay, I obviously I'm looking at you I guess for me how I look or how I found a be first off the first day. I saw it. I was distorted but I saw tan legs. Jean skirt and some curly hair and I was like, wow thank God Griffin likes her like curly hair. I was like wow.  She's she's very beautiful, but I couldn't see her face. So I had to wait till she got up close. No, I guess for something to point out like y'all for girls. I guess y'all just kind of just do your own thing like you you can't force someone to like you you don't need to look a certain way for any type of person like it's not it's it's honestly impossible like unless you physically or asked the guy what he wants.  Wants in a girl what he wants you to wear like and you don't need to like mold who you are to anyone else's like preference like because love right person is going to like you for you, right and it's just it's physically impossible unless you're dating Siri. Alright, that's about it.  And you have anything else for girl, I guess I just need to be able to express themselves in their own ways. Like I think that's really important is just like making sure you know who you are and don't worry about with like that is one thing I like stand by for the my whole life. Don't worry about what other people think. Oh, yeah. Griffin is huge on that like he drills that into my head like since day one regulation, like even before I met Abby I sold it like adware basketball shorts in  Steakhouse, I don't like it like it doesn't matter like yeah, I think that yeah your points just like being yourself is the most important thing because you don't want to have someone like or fall for a false representation of you because eventually you're going to get tired of trying to uphold the standard that's not yourself and then they're going to end up realizing that you're not the person you've been showing them. You are like in your putting up a front and you're not gonna be able to hold up that front by forever. So it's important to just be yourself from day.  One and I think that I have never done that in the past, but with Griffin he was so easy to talk to and I was so comfortable being around him that from day one. I was so comfortable with him and like I feel like in relationships, you know, like it takes a lot of time for you to get like super comfortable with your significant other like, you know, sometimes you know, you're just like oh Clash you don't want to cry in front of my boyfriend or whatever. I like literally from I don't know. I feel like from the beginning maybe not day one, but I feel like within the first few weeks. I felt very comfortable.  With him just because of how open he was so I felt okay being open and return and I think I was also like ready. I don't know. I think that having that was refreshing because I feel like a lot of the guy friends I had in high school. We're just kind of like surface-level friendships and didn't really go much deeper. So it was kind of exciting for me. Well also, I think like for in a forgotten like a guy's point of view,  They'll notice you when they noticed you like. You can't like you can't force it. Yeah, you can't that's like that's the bottom line. You can't force it at all. Like it's just yeah, I think being yourself the best thing to do because I feel like I've definitely on phases in my life where I'm like tried a little too hard. Like I feel like I'm a middle school years like constantly like oh my gosh like yeah trying to like be the cutest thing ever and it's just like a waste of effort and energy because we're all Aqua like like no one's really that awkward anymore Middle School literally for the longest time like my  My parents like my parents parents my friends their parents. They always told like they always told me you can't look for somebody literally I didn't I stop looking Abby walked into my life. That's the easiest kids. It's because I was sitting there. I am not looking for anybody. This is the last thing I want and you were and then you were also on that same page, but you had just gotten on that same page and soda.  Sighs so did I so it was just like very interesting how that worked out? Okay. So next we're going to go into kind of like the a lot of people are asking about like our opinion on the college relationships and like the stereotypical stereotype. Oh my gosh stereotype they have and like making things work out of that. I think the stereotype for college relationships is mainly just I don't know people just kind of like casually see each other and date and aren't really that exclusive and people are just kind of like, well, I know it's awful. I think that if you can find someone  And that you know you get along with and that you enjoy being around and that you know motivates you to be a better person. I think having a relationship is a great idea in college, but I also want to emphasize that you know, also I want to totally disclaim this entire episode and give a disclaimer. Like don't think we have a perfect relationship because we are so far from perfect as individuals and together as a couple but we've also came along. Oh, yeah, and that's very important and you know people's outside view of us like you can't let people outside  View of you or relationship or your relationship, you know affect how you view your relationship because only know you know deep down and I don't even know where I was going with this but basically don't feel pressured just because like Griffin I are sitting here talking to you and we've been in a relationship for two years in college or don't feel pressured because some of your roommates or your friends around you are getting in relationships. Don't feel pressure that you need to be in one because everyone's time will come and it's different for everyone because I think a lot of people, you know mature faster and the  And Chip Brown than others and summer ready before others and that's totally okay because if everyone was on the same time scheduled I would just be really weird and everyone's time will come so don't put pressure on yourself. It's okay, if you're not in a relationship in college or in high school or whatever your time will come and like I said when you're not looking for it, that's usually when you find it. Yeah, but I guess like goes the whole stereotype thing. I don't have much to say other than that and just like I mean, obviously I think the relationship narrative  for college is kind of like  Immature and just lame in a sense because I feel like a lot of people just get hurt and call it all the time. But I feel like if you can find, you know someone to make it work with it's worth it. Yeah, that was kind of like just a weird question. Yeah, because I don't know. I don't even know what the actual question said that the way I typed it on my Google doc. I just didn't really like formative question. Okay. So now how to get close to your significant others Family Griffin's raising his hand. Yeah. I right. Yeah, I roasted Jairo.  Rose my head I raised my hand. Yeah rest. All right, whatever. All right. It's been a long day. Okay guys now I guess for that one how to get close to your significant others Family honestly whenever I went over to Abby's house, I didn't think I was getting that close light with her.  With her dad I got closer to her mom. Like like it was so easy. It was so easy. My dad is to my dad's just obviously - little bit know. No, you know, no I was just like I feel like your Dad we just recently got close? But yeah, I feel like because I we hold them like we heard every time we saw each other but it was like we didn't really talk a lot like but like when I said finally said, yeah, yes, we can go surfing I think I think I  Brought some joy and some joy to mr. Phillips. Oh, yeah you done. I think I mean he loves you to death and he always has I think it's just like obviously I think a lot of dads in most cases. I don't want to say all and like claim that it's every dad but like a lot of times dads are just protective, you know. Yeah. Well no, but I think to get close to your significant others family. I feel like you just got it. You gotta go with the flow you got to do what they want to do. You gotta you can eat it. You can ask them if they want to do some stuff like I do.  Really have the opportunity to ask like saying that much but I asked like when he was at school here with us. We went to eat like every once in a while and that's just at that for me because in the past I felt like dating like and maybe I'll just put I was in high school but like my boyfriend's they're like people I would see whatever that really I don't know interact with my brother or dad as much and you've always done that from the beginning and that's just like always stood out so like my whole family and  I just think that another important thing with like getting close to your significant others Family you do needs it's really important. Just like I said earlier you have to be yourself because you don't want to give a false perception to a family either and I think that I mean obviously like you're not going to like be the way you are always around your significant other but you want to at least like be able to talk to them and have conversation with them and you know, have a good partnership. Yeah, and I think that like Griffin said, you know, Griffin has a huge family. I have a small family.  And I just think that for me it was like overwhelming like that meeting so many siblings and like I feel like I'm you know, obviously like a lot closer to like Grayson and hold and I feel like just cause they're closer to our age and we see them more often but like Haley and cat. I love hanging out with them and talking to them too. And you just have to find like what your significant others family's interests are like individually per person and kind of like play off of that like I love like, you know when your brother Carriage yeah and when your mom and I will like go on walks with the dogs together and like this talk and like your mom and I could talk forever.  So I think like stuff like and she like loves doing that. So I was any time she asked me even if I don't feel like doing it. I'm like I need to do this because this is a great bonding opportunity for us to so I think that just I don't really know if that helps anyone but don't be scared. I think is another big thing for that should be open. Yeah, because I think I was very like hesitant. Like I like I was very nervous. Like when I went to dinner with your parents that first time after we had known each other for two weeks because I just I don't know it was very like outside of my comfort zone. We got a very nice restaurant. I was just  Very thrown off but I really enjoyed my time with them and I loved how open they were with me. I can understand how all of these tips would be very hard if the family of your significant other was very quiet and closed off. But in that case, I just think that you just kind of play off the way they are like you don't want to be everyone's guy was always going to be. Yeah. Everyone's gonna be there like you're not going to get my family for instance. Yeah. It's very open. Everyone talks. You're not going to get that everywhere you go. Yeah. I'm sorry about it. Like yeah. There's going to be very quiet.  Those are families and sometimes you just have to if you're a very extroverted person, you know, you may just have to like tone that down initially in the beginning until you can get them to open up really, it's you just you got to be the one that starts conversations. Yes, and I think that's about a thing to do than to, you know, diminish Yourself by yeah, you got to be willing. Yeah and you use that's the main point really got to be willing to do what they want to do and someone wanted us to like stress the importance of finding a significant other that encourages an uplift you and helps you believe in yourself and just to briefly like touch on this.  I know we're literally talking for forever. This is more just like a statement instead of like a question because I feel like I don't know like I feel like this is something you don't realize the importance of it until you have it because I feel like my self confidence in the past in relationships and my insecurities were a lot more present and strong in the past. And I don't think it's necessarily always to do with the person. I'm dating it also depends on the stage of life. I'm in I know like ever since I started my YouTube channel my  my I've been a lot more comfortable with my insecurities more comfortable with myself and who I am and I've always been more confident in myself, but I really think that Griffin always like goes out of his way to encourage me and uplift me and that's really important especially on the days where you can't provide that for yourself. So I think finding someone that can do that for you on the days where you're feeling at your lowest of lows when you can't be there supporting yourself as really nice, but at the end of the day, you also have to you have to be whole yourself before you get in a relationship with someone else because then you  Become fully reliant on the other person and dependent on them for your own happiness and confidence pretty much how I be is with me now. I'm just playing with you. Yeah, I just think that that's what I just said. It's like very important and I think that once you're completely confident in who you are you're able to extend that life-giving of confidence and to other people's lives at that makes sense. Like if I'm fully confident maybe not fully confident, but if I'm confident in myself and who I am and I  I am whole and happy by myself. I do a lot better of a job at bringing Griffin up in our relationship because I feel okay myself and I'm not trying to like bring him down to my level if that makes sense. So I think that that's like really important to make sure that your whole yourself that was kind of a tangent to that question or statement but it is really important to have someone that's encouraging and uplifting rather than you know diminishing and what's the word demeaning I guess but I was going to say it but I couldn't get I beat you.  Okay. So now I'm going into kind of like the middle or rocky part of our relationship and fart a lot of people know this if you've been around the YouTube channel for a while, but we liked a lot of relationships did have a break our break was it was it was short but it still hurt. Yeah. It was what November December January was 4 months and Charlie. Wow. I didn't realize how early it wasn't a relationship.  Dang, okay time flies. Uh, yeah. So in February of 2018, we just like took a break. I honestly I am going to let Griffin like talk as much as he wants to about animating force him to like go into extreme detail or anything, but I I'll just let him say what he wants to say about it before I say anything because I don't know how far I can go We're not gonna tell you guys everything but we're gonna tell you guys a lot so you can understand this better. I just felt honestly I can say  It was a point where I need to also find myself. Like honestly, I did rush into the relationship but like it doesn't didn't change the fact how much like I cared and loved a be like I love I love you so much. Obviously, I got back together with her like that's what yeah, but like I took the break I wanted to find myself because I mean, I got to the University of Alabama, which was when we pretty much when we first met we yeah, we polish it is claimed that he hadn't been in, Alabama.  Freshman year he was at a different School playing baseball and was like 30,000 most kids. There's only 900 there. But yeah, so it was just he had come into Alabama like when we met he had only been lobbying for like two or three weeks. So it's kind of like a culture shock for him. And I think that from my perspective you were at a point where you I think you realized that it was too much too fast because like I went to your house at Christmas break like three months into our relationship and I just feel like I probably pressured you into doing that when you might not have been right.  Easy for me to like come home and stay with you for a week. And I tried saying if a guy he's never hurt my feelings. I was just like, oh, I'd love to like, you know, come visit your family over Christmas break and like meet everyone since I'd only met some of his family and you know that I think that that is just a example of the bad communication we had and the beginning of our relationship was we're both scared to say, it's some things sometimes but in from my perspective, I think the break was also like Griffin was going through a lot in terms of like  No culture shock and like I know I was very blindsided by it. And the sense that like I couldn't believe it was happening. But at the same time in hindsight, I remember like back in when it happened. I remember looking back to January and being like I knew this was coming and I was just too scared to admit it to myself just because we were having a lot of like communication issues. We weren't really on the same page as much anymore. Like we had very few did the good days are few and far between but looking back that's not really an excuse to take a break like I think that  You know, you're going to have hard times and you have to get through them. But that was a Learning lesson for us that when things get hard and you're just like not really feeling yourself or but you also shouldn't just do what I did. Yeah, you should work through it. Yeah. Yeah drop it. Yeah. Yeah because it was very it was very very very hard on me and you know, like my close friends know that and I was just like a really hard time just because Griffin was like the closest I had been to a guy as far as just like I had opened up so much to him about things that I just like how to open up.  People within the past so it was hard on me. And you know, I don't hold that against him. I think you know forgiveness is a powerful thing it took me time, but I think our break I really want to stress the importance of like just not cutting things off when things get hard or when things don't feel right or when you don't feel right. If you need to find yourself and you truly did just get into a relationship when you weren't ready, then it is very hurtful to the other person to break it off, but maybe definitely definitely express it before you just  Just yeah, cuz I he didn't really express that to me until the day it happened and I was just like wait what not but we kind of just like he made in contact over that time a little bit. We don't want that we texted the day it happened that we kept texting. Yeah, and it was just because like because Griffin was like still wanting to be friends, but I was just like, I don't think I can do that for the sake of like my feelings and he respected that but then I was like wait. No, I actually want to see him so we would like go to the library together, but we never really like hung out in each other's place together.  And I just think that like it's really important not to just give up when things get tough feel like that. Honestly helped us like oh, yeah helped us a tongue hanging out because then we could you have those times when you're just like you don't want to communicate like I don't know. It's like I felt like it was just like a title thing for me like whenever like it was just hard for me to like talk about stuff like yeah, I wasn't very good at communicating but like  the just having the title as friends I can talk just how we did before we started. Yeah, you just have the pressure of like this serious relationship, you know, like I don't want to mess up like a lot of girls go through this in college, you know, you're so serious about the relationships here and you were just like, you know hundred percent all until the end and like the guys like don't really I think the guys feel that way but then they kind of like when they feel like any kind of like withdrawal from themselves or something like they just kind of what I feel like,  All right, honestly.  Was that first a hundred bike? Oh, yeah anywhere hundred fifty percent think I freaked you out. Once we got really serious. Yeah, and then I was just like, oh my gosh, I got to be do this every day. Like, I don't know what I'm doing, but then and that was all just like a consequence of us rushing are really yeah friends. This is all him yet. Yeah, and I think that we got past it. Thank the Lord because I my whole thing and this is like another really important thing. Don't just get back together with someone if they break up with you because that just like shows you that your  No, yeah, you're open to do that. Every time that they don't feel like dancing and it gives them a big advantage of yeah, pretty much. Yeah. So because my thing was I think it was like around because we broke up at the end of very end of February and then spring break right before spring break started was when we like kind of discussed getting back together and I just I told my thing with Griffin I was like look, I need you to like look me in the eyes and promise me like I will take your word but right now, you know like  I obviously did it was like oh, I believe you. Yeah, I was like, I don't really want to believe your words because I'm scared of what's going to happen. But I'm open to what this relationship could be. If you can promise me that you'll never you know, do that to me again and just like I don't know just Blindside break up with me. But I mean since then, you know, we've had really big fights and we have a broken up because we've worked through them and since then they're like so much has happened. And since that day we  Broken up or almost. I mean, I don't say almost broken up because everyone says dumb things when they're fighting. Yeah, and that's just something that everyone has to work on is the patience and the you know, it's how you use your words and stuff - stuff. So how we resolve our arguments and such for resolving arguments were not like relationship therapist, and we're not professionals at this because the number one thing is communication. Let's say it together. Yeah unification. All right.  You really say it again? That's good. But yeah communication was our biggest issue in the beginning of our relationship. We were expecting each other to know what each other was thinking what each other was wanting and that's just not the way to live. You have to express what you need at the end of the day in your relationship. You have to express what flies and doesn't fly in your relationship. I mean, yeah, let him know what you do. Yeah, you just I mean you just have to literally communicate it's simple as that like, I think that the root of a lot of  Problems is poor communication or dishonesty or you know just not listening because I think a lot of people listen to hear them like hear what the person has to say it so that they can say something instead of listening to understand the other person and that was all about, you know, just the communication everything and I think understanding what hurts you have the person you're with and what makes them upset is really important because then you know, you know what to say.  What not to say what's true that it's truly the little things that like, yeah, I just got it. You got you can't take anything for granted. Okay, take advantage of anything. You just gotta be straight up talk things out try not to yell. I'm a I can't I can't lie like I'm a huge yellow like I come from a big family. I yell we like that's how yeah, his whole family is just a bunch of you. Totally know where you got your Yelp Just because you try to  go the other person but I read something we I try to do I try to tell Abby to do it is like  when you if you're arguing give them 5 to 10 minutes to let them cool down here, sir. Let them say their what the hell and then without interrupting them and then you talk like it's as easy as that. Yes. It's really it's really In the Heat of the Moment like when you're arguing, you know, you just write that in there. I think a lot of people's natural instinct is to get their point across and be the person that's right, but you have to kind of like take a step back and like Griffin said just let each other talk it out. And you know, like this is just us being completely transparent like obviously we have flaws and  Bishop Griffin does y'all sometimes and it's not really like a don't be a selective listener? Yeah. I like my thing is like I A lot of times I think I think that I'm right but then I don't know it takes me a lot of yelling from groaning yelling at me like taking you know, 10 minutes like think about the situation just be like, okay. Well, yeah that wasn't right of me and I'm wrong in accepting that said it's like my flaws like always thinking I'm right.  Which I know is incredibly annoying just as Griffons Falls yelling not just us being straightforward and transparent and I don't know. I feel really weird saying that because I feel like I never talked about this on YouTube and I've been working on the yelling thing. And that's a thing like this is as long as you don't just like those things like that as far as like resolving arguments. Our biggest thing is we will sit down and you know, like we're like, what is this problem at hand? Let's address it. Like right now we don't because I used to be someone to let it I would bottle it up and then I would  Load on Griffin with like a trillion different things. He was like, where is this coming from? And I was just like, oh I let this build up inside of me for the past like two weeks. And now I'm exploding on you. Yeah, let's fix. It was just too much all at once. So it's just like, oh my God communicating things as they come and like sitting down and like actually talking through them instead of letting them build up and just putting them on hold like you can't put your relationship on hold like when things are rough like you got to sit there and talk about it and you know, like what Griffin and I like I told Griffin at one point in our relationship I was  Like look we both need to realize that that it is not you versus me. It is US versus the problem. Like we still have problems with me and we still comes back. So we're not perfect like a lot of times we do end up arguing in a you versus me type of sense and then you know, 20 minutes later. We're both like what the heck are we doing? It's the yeah, I'll have the time. I forget what we argue but no and then, you know like 20 minutes later. Griffin's like it. I I just I don't even know what's going on. Like obviously, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's just I think that a lot of times, you know people but Griffin,  Both have like really short tempers. I feel like so it's just like, I don't know. I think that learning learning how each short hair short video to learn how each person Works in a relationship and learning how to communicate with that person because it's a different Case by case obviously, like there are healthy and unhealthy ways to argue and like being relationships and you obviously shouldn't tolerate certain things and you should know when to like draw the line with some things and I just want to  like this clip that for anyone that needs to hear that like, you know, you shouldn't accept you know anything that's abusive obviously emotionally mentally like degree physically the grading or you know, just abusive like that's just not not the way it should be in a relationship and you need to you know, get out of it if that's the case for you but as far as communicating and like resolving arguments go it's just like  The number one things is sitting down communicating right then and they're not letting it build up and listening to the other person. I'm still trying to get this through have you said? Yeah stop. Yeah because my short fuse I like when I address it right down in there and it but it's actually Toyota will know she's texting me essays and I'm like, I can't wait all that. That's a lot. Yeah, so it's just better to communicate. This thing's face to face in person if possible or over the phone like talking and not texting. So it's really important. We kind of went on a lot of kids there, but  Us it like that whole process of like getting to a point where you know how to communicate well, and obviously it's not going to be a hundred percent perfect every time but communicating well and resolving arguments that was such a process for Griffin died because it started out in a completely different stage from where we're at right now and like what people were asking what we always argue about food. Yeah. We really where we where we leave we get advice about that. Well, yeah because I just want to go from the give me options.  Ins and then I'll choose but he doesn't like doing that. No because okay. Here's the thing. She is so picky I'll be anything but like she literally do this. She'll name like three of the same places pretty much like she'll be like Firehouse noose pub/sub or Panera. That's like of all I get from those places are sandwiches. It's like just choose one of them, but it's something like eating and then I think that like when both of us get really stressed,  We just pretend to like wash out think that it with that which we're going to get into like in the end of like the last segment which we get into later that's like an adjustment to living together that you know, we're dealing with because if you guys didn't hear in like I think the first episode I mentioned that we live together this year my roommate of freshman sophomore and junior year moved back home for nursing school, and I didn't want to like re sign my lease in my appartment and end up with like two random people and I literally don't know that many people at Alabama and I didn't really have options her roommate.  So it just like worked out best for Gryffindor because we felt ready to do that whenever we were signing leases or whatever. So we just found a house to rent together that happens to have some complimentary rodents. But yeah, they're friendly very there. No, no and I think talking about trust and if people want to talk about trust which I think is an issue and everyone's relationship at some point. We've gone through a lot of hard times trusting each other.  It'd be like and a lot of it stemmed for I know for me was from past like issues and like relationships same with Griffin. We both carried so much emotional baggage with trust issues into our relationship with it with each other that didn't really get uncovered until a couple months into our relationship. And you know, I vocalize that with Griffin that I had, you know, like been cheated on in the past like multiple times or whatever. So I was like, my trust issues are like really low, which you the whole thing is like  My mom has always told me you have to trust people until they give you a reason not to so that was just like my mindset with Griffin, but that did not stop me from stressing over. What us, you know, like what if Griffin's like, you know texting someone yawns. I think that's why my what if situation was so bad because she kind of brought I've never been in what if person for as how I like ya told him that like, that's how my mind was because that's how I had been like,  I had been almost like transformed into this person. It was consoling thinking of like what else like what if this person doesn't like me anymore. What if this person is about to break up with me? What if this person is never the case, you know being disloyal to me and that's just like so unhealthy and I want to tell you right here right now if you are like that because you've been cheated on the past you need to like the remember that you have to keep that separate from the relationship you're in now and I don't know because I was just so bad with it like and looking back. I'm just like good gosh. I was just like  Good Golly Golly gracious. I was setting up my own complete, you know destruction by doing that and trust is developed in relationships. It's not really granted from the beginning and I think everyone knows that because I mean well, okay that's kind of true kind of Falls because I think that you just kind of have to go into relationship trusting that person until I give you a reason not to but at the same time you kind of build that trust with time and I think that like someone breaks her trust and whatever way it doesn't have to be cheating or anything but  Just like lie to you about something, you know, it's a case-by-case basis on whether or not that should be tolerated and we're not going to get into that because we don't have time to but like if someone breaks your trust forgiveness is a thing and I think forgiveness is the right thing to do and a lot of situations not all situations. Okay? Wait, let me rephrase that forgiveness is always the answer but it doesn't always result and remaining together is what I want to say is I think that you should always forgive the other person when you are ready. There's no time limit on that and when you know,  Oh, you personally feel ready to forgive the other person for breaking your trust, but that doesn't necessarily mean that if someone like literally is repetitively cheating on you. You should forgive them and stay with them like you should forgive them. You know, whenever you feel you're ready down the road but definitely will stay with that person cuz that's not good for you at all. And I don't know I think that a big thing for trust. I like heard this on. I don't know if it was a podcast for what but I would say about a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago this completely  As for my life, but it was just like hearing that trust like it's something that it's like a circle of control issue because it's like you can only worry about what's inside of your circle of control what ifs situations they aren't real. They're not happening there hypothetical situations made up in your head that you know, like you're like little devil on your shoulder is telling you and your head subconscious. Yeah, it's your, you know, like you're sitting at creating situations that aren't real out of nothing and out.  Of you know your insecurities and your fear and yourself and that's outside of your circle of control. Like if the person wants to you know be as loyal to you and if the person wants to lie to you they will do you have control over that no, like if someone wanted to you know lie to you about going somewhere with somebody and they did that you have no way of stopping that person from lying to you know, what I mean? Like there was no way to stop the person from there.  To stop your significant other or friend or family member from doing what they are going to do. Like they have full intentions of doing something. You can't control that like, I don't think that it's something that's worth stressing over and eating your relationship a lot like letting it your relationship alive. It's not good to you know, let that affect you and the trust and relationship all those what of situations and that was just for me a repercussion of everything that had happened to me in the  Past I was a very wet of person like situation based person or not necessarily like all these extreme wettest. Just like little what-ifs. Like what if this person is, you know, not texting me back because I know no one of those I guess I was thinking I was like, where are you going? I don't know. I just like started talking. But what if this person is, you know, like not actually going to sleep right now and like they're just lying about going this way because they don't want to talk to me like just little stuff like that like every little situation whether it mattered or not. I was freaking myself out over and it's not worth it because  Those outside of our circle of control and made me miserable and made mine and graphs relationship worse because I was sitting there saying I trusted him when I did it just because I was so caught up on things from the past and that's just not good. So yeah, that's kind of like the middle meaty segment of our relationship this podcast going to be so wrong. So our last segment. We're just going to go into kind of like our future from here and kind of  Like us right now with living together our future career goals and post-grad plans were both planning on getting our masters here at Alabama haven't really started the application process, but we need to by the end of the year. So it's Nation rolling around and I have an internship in Houston summer 2020 and Griffin's working on he may be in Dallas. He may be in Houston. I really want to be a doll and solo. But yeah, so depending on that we met  Not have to do long distance, but I'm sure we'll be able to see each other, you know, hop on a flight or drive the four hours to see each other. We do long-distance like during my mom better keep her word. That's all I got to say. You hear that Mindy. She said I'll can help on flights every week. And if you want we'll get them cheap. If you schedule like a month ahead. I'm being serious mom, but our yeah our summer plans. I guess we may have to do long distance and like I know someone asked about our law.  Long distance like during Christmas and like summer during the Summers. We've been together every summer because the first summer I fight like a bunch of internships in the one that I happened to get it was in Houston. So that first summer we were like, I didn't live with your friends family or anything but we're both in the city of Houston. And then last summer we were in Dallas and then next summer. It's kind of like TVD but as far as like Christmas break goes we just always make sure we FaceTime and I guess the FaceTime dates aren't the main way we just like  Make sure you like stay in contact and like hang out with each other over the phone. I guess dealing with long distance in that sense. Like I think time apart is like always good and like being with your family is always good. So best I guess the easiest way to do long distance is the FaceTime calls, but make sure you schedule a time because I was really bad about that. Yeah.  It's really always gotta bring that back in. But um, yeah, so I have done long distance before not with Griffin and a big part of that is, you know, trust and communication and I'm not going to go into more detail than that because we've already talked a lot about both of those things as far as like, you know my life and how busy I am. I think this has become extremely apparent this semester. How do you handle be be so busy? Sorry.  I just got like so nasal like what is going on? How do you handle me being so busy I guess.  And put it into like a putting a little like steps, I guess for me for me dealing with Abby being so busy. It's super difficult because I'm attention wanting person. Oh, yeah gross gross like love. I don't we took the language assessment. I don't even remember what our things were. But Griffin is I mean a very affectionate and I mean he he loves getting attention for me whether that's just like us hanging out with each other.  There or be just like talking to him which I think is really cute. But like I'm really bad at reciprocating that when I'm busy because but I'm busy I get in my head and I'm just like I got to get x y z w QRS TUV done and I just totally like but you're done. No II know I meant to just do XYZ and then I was like, but there's more than three things then just add another letters. But anyways, I have to get all this stuff done. So you like I'm going to prioritize getting all this stuff done and then I'll pay attention the graph in which that's just something I'm very bad about doing.  Doing and I don't recommend doing that because if you know Griffin's like very independent and like hell hang out with his own friends and I'll hang out with mine but heading into my question. Yeah. Okay. Sorry to cut you off. No, you're fine. No, so I guess basically is you gotta I keep myself. I try his hardest like hard as possible to keep myself busy. So I go to the gym what I was saying, so I I go hang out with mother.  Friends and stuff like that, but sometimes it's honestly it's not enough I'd well and then I'll just start pestering Abby. That is that is how it goes. I will but it will all stop like I'll go watch Netflix. I'll go watch TV. I think I guess just keeping yourself if she's busy. Keep yourself busy. Like I'm not a huge like I I don't like school. Like I want to be done with it like maybe some people  I like that that maybe some people do like school and they can go instead of waiting around for like your girlfriend boyfriend or whoever you go to school where you go to stuff like that. Sometimes I go to the library, but it's once in a blue moon. That's our meeting on that leg. I think that kind of going off of that too. It's really important to just like balancing time with each other like with my busy schedule and all of that. We just have to like set aside, you know a day.  The week at least one day where we hang out together and it's just Griffin died. And you know, we're not on our phones. We're not doing schoolwork because a lot of times we just use our time that we go to the gym together a few times a week normally and then our time, you know eating together. That is what one thing I am huge on is when we're watching a movie or show. There are no phones in there nothing. That's all for good reason because it's like the only time we were spending to get beginning of  A master like me adjusting to like everything going on. It was just so hard because it was just a lot and the only time we were spending together was us going to the gym and like just getting dinner definitely guy got probably an hour and a half of a day with that be yeah and I mean, yeah even less than that honestly, but like it was just hard because it was a big adjustment for me and that's just like a learning experience and that's just one of those things. We had sit down and communicate about for example, like we have the once things like got rough and we were like, oh my gosh, this is like tagged like taking a  Hold on both of us. We need to sit down and talk about it. So we did and I think that that's you know, really important to make sure you sit down and if you're if you're in a relationship with someone and you on both have really busy schedules were opposite schedules. I kind of Zane and Jordan, you know, same Works eight to six or something and Jordan Parks seven the seven and like from night to send in the morning. This is literally have opposite schedules and yeah because runs a nurse and Zane's engineer and you know, like I think a big thing for them  M is you know like their time on the weekends and everything and the time that they do have together. Obviously, you have to make the most of it. So that's really important dedicating that time. We have to find you have to find because more than likely there is like when even if it's only an hour, yeah. Yeah. It's an hour's not even enough. You got to take what you can get. Ya some weeks. It's like I there's one hour where it's just Griffin. I am not working on score not working on YouTube stuff and we'll watch our show together. Yeah, and that  No that makes both of us very happy. And then I think we can just talk about us living together to kind of like wrap things up. A lot of people were like, this was the most acid like segments in question. So definitely had to like stay for the whole episode to hear this part the biggest adjustment to living together on my end. I think was not having like a roommate that was like a girl just because Macy was my roommate for three years. So it was like really weird not having her here and it  Getting to that and the fact of like the person I was living with this person. I was dating was just really weird instead of it being my friend. Yeah. I think that was the biggest adjustment just because this summer we technically live together, even though it was with two other people and bass adjustment for me is helping out around the house is hard as it is to say I I've just never been a huge like, I'm not dirty. No, you're just not I'm not like I'm not gonna be like, I'm a little magic. So I just used a dish. I'm gonna put it in the dishwasher.  I'm not going to do that. Like I'm sorry, but I have tried my best for one out of every five dishes. I'll put it in my will all go credit where credit to do. Griffin could be so much worse. I know their way Messier and dirty or guys out there because Griffin's not dirty. He's just messy and disorganized but that's okay because when I'm busy on the exact same way, but it's really bad because I'm getting these moves where I went everything to be perfectly clean and organized and in its place and I'm not getting off the couch with my thing is like because this normally happens at the end of  the week like once everything's done and I'm exhausted and I'm like this place needs to be spotless and everything needs to be in order yet the past four days. I've been fine with you know, my living in pairs of shoes being in the living room and then all of a sudden I'm like crap and get your stuff up. You're like wait, you're somebody no, no, no. No, but it's very high-energy spurts of cleaning at the end of the week when all my school.  Stan and I'm not stressed out anymore and I'm like this place needs to be spotless and in order and I just like expect reference to like stop everything and do everything and I think that like another question that people ask was like just dividing chores, you know, the way we kind of have a divided Griffin like occasionally helps me with Dish. It's honestly dividing to ours is not it doesn't really work them now because we don't really have like a set thing only thing that set is that Griffin like does the laundry and I fold it, but I'm like it's very last days of cool basically last days ago.  It is cool lack of a school. Let's do a vocabulary last Serie. You don't know how to work your seat lackadaisical. Yeah, so I can be a school isn't lacking enthusiasm and determination carelessly lazy. What is last day school is lasted a school word.  Laser days ago work. Okay, great. We have the answer. Don't argue with me on the book. Very funny. All right. Yeah, but I guess it is a very lackadaisical. Is that house a lot of lackadaisical tour. I've been saying it wrong my whole life. Oh my gosh. All right. Well the more you know, but now it's just like it's tough because like you put it in it has to wash like an hour and a half like the times Gonna Fly. You got to be hungry like and it's just  Pain, like that's what he does and then I followed it and then like this past Friday. We just kind of like the vacuum some we both kind of like cleaner own bathroom since we have our own bathrooms because I could not like share a bathroom the graphics. That's one area that you're a little bit more messy than others. I'm really not that message. I think most guys are so it's okay. Not most guys. I don't know say accident - I don't leave my clothes. I put my clothes where they need to go. I don't even have the time but I just really basket near my clothes are in it. Okay, but um,  oh dirty clothes. Okay. Yeah, he do dirty clothes. But like if you try something on which I do this. Oh my God, totally. Oh, yeah, I did exact same thing in the morning feel like putting it up. I put it up there. Anyways, that was a big tangent as far as like chores go if there's like an issue with getting your significant other to do something start one thing at a time just because in the beginning I can graph and I started living together, you know growing up like I've been I mean, I've been cleaning like my bathroom and like all that stuff since I was like 10, I'm sorry. I was spoiled. Yeah straight out. I was spoiled.  Wrong with that had to clean anything on my own a Griffin's parent's worst college far too busy with as many kids as they had in like your Dad's job to you know, I don't know like I guess it could have been like delegated between all of you guys, but it's just when it's easier to get people to clean for you you're going to do it. It's the economically efficient solution and I hate myself for saying that but when you study economics a little bit, you know, it makes more sense to go with the more efficient solution. So you can afford it, you know, if you can afford it do it. Yeah.  Yeah, so we're going to screw up, you know, like having made and there's literally nothing wrong with that. There was a period of time in my life when my parents had maids and it was like the same situation, you know, like we were really busy and I were as kids because when we were really highly involved in our Sports at the time and then my parents I'd like work was a lot more demanding at that time and then, you know, once things calm back down we start cleaning again, but where I was going with that you just have to start small and then build up because initially it was just you know me. Let me be like, oh Griffin.  Put yourself back where it goes and then it was like oh Griffin. If you do the laundry, I'll fold the laundry. So if you help me load this load of dishes, we can go down a lot faster but to the gym quick but the thing for me, yeah. She does do that stuff. Sometimes with thing for me is not like when she's like, yeah, if you just put your stuff away, you know, whatever or if you do the laundry all folded for you now, it's like I'll do the laundry you fold it and put it away compromises are key in relationships. Okay compromise, I think that  I mean honestly because with us, it's just I'll put myself up sometimes sometimes he's the one, you know, like straightening up the living room. Sometimes I am sometimes I'm the one cleaning the floor. Sometimes he is and I know she's stressed. I added the greatness and just the kind hearted person. I am I'll do it for her. Yeah, which is very sweet because this past Friday when we were trying to prepare for my brother coming to town. He did most of cleaning besides like my bathroom, which was nice. What are you were in there? So, yeah, so  As far as like getting tired of each other living together you get tired of me. I get tired of her ever. I really don't get tired of a be like yeah, you fight but like that's just what I need. So like it's a it's a relationship then if we fight and if you if you're still upset go to a different room, like that's a beauty of like having more than one kid. I don't live in a studio together. You're crazy.  I love that we have like several rooms. We can go two separate spaces if we need to ideas like we just I don't like I'm never like oh, I'm tired of my girlfriend. Yeah, I I never get tired of Griffin like and that's if you're getting tired of the person you're with and like you might want to re-evaluate your the relationship just because I mean, I don't know. I don't want to say that because getting tired in the sense of like do I have to hang out? No, no. No, you should probably try to make a change and do something different and not going to not in the sense of  Waking up or any things like try doing different things with them. Don't just keep reliving the same day over and over again because things there are times especially in long-term relationships things were going to get boring and they're not going to be as exciting anymore. Once you're out of the honeymoon phase and you know, you will you have to recognize if there's a change needed you need to sit down and make that change and adjust or to keep things alive. I think like our biggest thing like I know we both really look forward to like having our you know, or we watch our shows together like we love watching Dynasty and I don't think I'm ever get tired of doing  That but yeah, like sorry math like that and we always look forward to doing together and like drinking a cup of hot chocolate or eating popcorn. Like we love doing that to a childish is it's a yeah, like he's having fun are still kids at heart. Yeah, you guys really enjoy doing and make sure you prioritize doing that and getting that done the keeping the spark alive is all about, you know doing German think yeah. If you do the same thing every day, you're going to get bored you like and I'm gonna flame is going your fuses ending. Okay, and it may take you know, like sitting down and brainstorm with personal to fund a tweet.  Go on or that's one thing we don't really we only go on dates that often but it's okay. I mean, we're really busy and be really hard for like that's not traditional. That's right. Okay. Yeah dates dates are very difficult because we go out to eat like and that's basically days. Yeah, but like we just don't classify things that I think once we start working full-time and it's not about to get home study. We can like go to a nice day and after spend time there talking and stuff. But yeah, and then I guess also  dang it. Oh for keeping the spark alive is like for me what I do. I know Abby thinks it's me pestering her as and like I will ask her if like I can be inner podcast if I can be more in her YouTube channel, like I like to be part of her life like all the time. Yeah, like that's just not make things more exciting because it's like exploring new territory for both of us. I think so, that's really good. And I think that like, I don't know.  How do you think living together has changed our relationship I guess?  It's changed. Our relationship is in.  We've learned how to share things like we split groceries. I'd be laying how to you got to be able to show space. Obviously if you're gonna live with someone like sometimes I go through I have phases on Mike Abby if you're going to be doing work, are you doing something like because the couch that's my safe space. That is my happy place. I'm watching TV on that couch. There won't be any school work being done on that couch, and I can't get my scored all the times on the couch. So I'll just go to my desk.  That I have for a reason for my room. So nobody's it's brought definitely brought us closer and again spot brought us close around me has changed our relationship more. I'd like only thing that's changed I think is just learning how to coexist in the same space all the time and learning how to like, I know it's really weird like living with your significant other instead of a friend. Like I said when you're used to that in college, but that's pretty much everything because we've been talking you guys ear off. Hopefully you enjoyed it. I know that we probably could have answered a few more questions, but I know that there was a lot more we  Got into deeper than we expected. But just totally fine. But I'm not gonna do a Q&A at the end of this episode like I do with others just because the questions were implemented throughout the episode, but I hope you guys enjoyed it. If you want to find Griffin on social media his Instagram. What's your Instagram? Underscore Griffin one sentence underscore? Yeah. Yeah underscore Griffin Weinstein underscore.

Welcome to another episode of the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter and today an interview that I've been looking forward to its with Adam lateral of shift property styling in Hobart. And I was looking for do this one for a few reasons, but most of those in the industry will know of shift and we'll follow them along on Instagram and other social media doing some really interesting things and we get into a lot of what we've seen on Instagram in particular some of the things that we really cover we talked about  about how a experience with dirty laundry turned into a business which now is in a 1500 square meter warehouse and Hobart an industry leader. We talked about atoms rollers the non stylist in the team very similar to me with Phoebe being The Stylist me not going anywhere near that side of things. We also talked about an app with they have in development, which I'm going to leave as a bit of a teaser. I won't go into too much other than to say one of the things that they that going to be doing is letting  There are agents get live quotes on the spot when they're with one of their clients. So among other things so have a listen to that one something to look forward to in the future. And then we also get into why growth for growth's sake can be very damaging for your business and how Adam thinks about that and as a piece of advice that he wished he'd known early on in their kind of business life. So without further Ado I will hand over to Adam we get started by asking Adam what he  was doing before they got into property styling. I guess my background is advertising and marketing but I think it's really important to note that while a business and I say how is essentially a team effort. We are husband and wife team Donny and I have run the business since day one. I'm started the business. So we've come from varied backgrounds. I'm a set of been in advertising and marketing and Donnie was actually a pharmacist.  I tried so we've had very very backgrounds that have sort of somehow lettuce into property styling. It's probably some very useful. I guess skills from a marketing and advertising point of view, especially but I guess from a pharmacy point of view that customer service side of things as well. I imagine. Well, there's two distinct sides to it. I think there's you're right. There's the marketing distinctive marketing kind of side, but then there's also the the business orientation so I which is you know,  something that Donnie was very focused on managing the business driving the business running the teams heading up The Styling teams, whereas my focus is sort of largely centered around sales marketing and making sure that we are present in the market.  Do you have a follow-up question on that which I'll just hold for now, but given that for bit of context to those listening that Phoebe and I are here at Foxy or very similar in the sense of where a husband-and-wife team. So I'm very interested to kind of dig into that a little bit. But before we do that, how about we go all the way back and I've actually heard the from a video that you didn't talk to you gave that the idea for shift property styling was inspired by a pile of dirty laundry of all things. Why don't you tell us that story?  Three. Yeah, it's been interesting. We've been operating since 2006. So that's that's a long time in property styling terms in Australia. In fact, you know at the end of the day we were one of the early starters and fact we thought we thought we'd come up this great concept at the time that you know property styling would be something that would be about to do and no one else in the world to be doing it, of course upon further research that it was pretty active in the states. It was starting to get traction and here in Australia to in the biggest cities. Yeah. Well, I guess we all started when  No, and I went for a we're planning a weekend away and we decided that we're going to have a look at a couple of open homes for we shot off on this romantic weekend, but that's what you're we got into the properties and as we went through them, we would sort of horrified really by how people present at their property when they were listing it for sale and particular Open Homes, you know and walking through these homes and seeing giant piles of rubbish and you know stuff in the sink and you know socks and undies on the floor. It was just really  Lee really quite bizarre for us. You know, we just couldn't understand why people were doing it and so, you know, we went away for our holiday that day that's Saturday by the time we got up beers coast of Tasmania for a romantic weekend away. We'd already Harford the business plan. So, you know, I guess that's where we started from from early stages of concept to getting into Consulting and helping people in there lived in homes to three months later having four or five house lots of furniture sitting in our garage at home.  Which is where it sounds like a lot of companies start a certainly we started in terms of that garage was full and then slowly it kind of creeps into maybe a storage shed somewhere and onwards and upwards from there. Yeah, definitely, you know, and we did the exact same thing. You know, we've got to a point where you know with our second living space is gone our back third fourth bedroom had gone the garage was gone. And you know, we eventually still got so excited about investing in 70 square meters of red warehouse space, you know, and you look at it now.  Now we've moved from that to 300 to 400 to five fifteen hundred square meters now, so it's you know, it's all about Progressive stages in developing the business and if it's really interesting. I don't think that any staging company that is going down the path of you know, buying their own stock and building up their own inventory. I don't think that anybody that I've spoken to who is either kind of early in that stage or thinking about at all maybe a little bit further along like yourselves. Nobody hasn't had that same.  I'm sort of process and happening to figure it out. You know at what point can I go into storage shed? And how am I going to get this stuff in and out and make it efficient? And you know what? Maybe it's getting too complicated being in five different storage sheds and now I need to find one space and then I need to expand, you know, all of the same issues. I think everybody that goes down the path of buying their own imagery is going through the same thing. Yeah, you know, it was interesting listening to image and last week, you know, she's got to see got the flexibility of utilizing High companies and so on, you know, we never had that here in Hobart. So it was always  had to be something we had to do. We had to have our own inventory. There was no choice and like Imogen we've done the would done the Deborah golf course, which was the only course available the time to sort of get some background education, but the markets in the US and Canada is so incredibly different from the one here in Australia that at the end of the day there were elements in running your business that were relevant, but the rest unfortunately didn't quite match our Mark if you're in Australia, so we had to we had to learn and adopt and grow and and  Yes old along the way to determine what was next what we had to do. I mean this is all in a time before iPhones existed as well. So, you know, it's it's it was it was crazy time. See other photographers were still using 35 mil film to take photos of houses for sale. It's all definitely a lot faster these days with the technology and the iPhones and everything available. Yeah. Well, I'd ever questioned again that I'm going to hold for now about kind of some of the changes that you've seen recently, but before I get into that  You did we did touch on the fact that you are husband and wife team and Danielle is I guess the The Stylist among other things to my first question because as I mentioned it's very specific to me is that all for me? I'm not the stylist in our team either and I guess I want to get a sense of what is your kind of an average day for you in your business given that you're not specifically The Styling side of things unless I'm mistaken. No. No, I think I think you're right. I think much much as you say I mean Daniel  images all in a great deal the important elements of the business including managing statistics looking at the accounting following up with our supplies ordering stock managing our team of stylists and getting sort of that side of the business operational, you know, it's so important to make sure that all these elements in a row aside from just the styling day-to-day business, you know running a business is  Different from just having a silent business styling is great and we get lots of people saying, you know, we'd love to be a stylist. But at the end the day it's they're looking for the joy of fluffing cautions. Not the sort of happy with the work that goes into running a business. So I guess you know, we have a we have a team of 12 the full timers timers and casuals but our day-to-day jobs, you know, we run a business where we're trying to look for a  One to two installations a day. We have our own obviously our own inventory, but we also have our own Logistics. So we have our own truck and van and remove the screw which we decided to do in probably more recent years go through that a bit more detailed to but you know, basically the process is for us is that you know, we have large pack Bay's where we bring all the furniture together in one area to package job, so  So I've select the furniture after being out with the sale as a salesperson to choose to look at the jobs have to allocate the furniture. We the size thing come through and top dress make sure everything is ready to go. We review the job to make sure it all meets the requirements of the job and then photograph it pack it down and have it ready for the logistics guys to load on the truck the night before the job so that we're ready to go for a 7:30 start the next morning.  And is there any little side note? Is it DF days where you're you're so busy that that pre-loading doesn't get done because I'm like to be as organized as you're saying but unfortunately for us it doesn't always happen that way it's rare really rare some days. We have to pop in a little bit earlier in the morning to make sure the trucks loaded again if it's been delayed or has been rain or something like that, you know, we have fairly inclement weather down here the causes all sorts of grief for us, but generally speaking the  Because the guy's pretty accurate about their timing and what their responsibilities are and what their schedule is for the day and we allocate enough people to make sure it works pretty smoothly as well. And that's the that's the joy of that using casual workers. For example, is that as things get busier we increase our casual workload for the fruit picking season to make sure that we're getting through everything we need to sure. Okay. You've been you mentioned 2006 was when you started off.  Operation so it's been I guess 13 years or thereabouts since you started. Yeah a couple of very I guess broad questions and I'll leave them broad because you know, you answer them. However, you you want to how cut first comes to mind. But how would you sum up say the last 13 years, you know kind of sentence or two how that how it's been for you specifically as a business and what you've kind of seen look it's it's it could be depending on which day is it could be absolute hell that could Define the days and the way we work it could be abs and tights.  And they were really high points as well. So it really just does depend on what we find is that that is that when you when you when you have these absent eyes, you've got to look to fill in work to make sure that you're looking for new opportunities and to drive, you know business so that it's actually generating Revenue. That's the tough thing and you know, we've been through, you know times like the GFC for example, which which affected business terribly and consumer  Confidence so the market dropped off and people weren't selling and doing lights or stuff as well. But we've always believed that property styling is sort of a bit of an answer to most sort of eggs and ties where you know, if it's if it's busy and the markets booming the people want the premium dollar anyway still so styling is important, but the same in the market drops off, you know, it's just important to get styling done to try and get that dollar that you know highly competitive markets particularly.  When as you mentioned the other consumer confidence is down buyers aren't out there committing to things that they otherwise might of and I guess if there is that slow down in the book on the I guess demand side. Obviously the better you can stand out from the small amount of Supply there is or potentially the large amount of Supply. There is then the better outcome you're going to get that's right and it didn't show comes down to competition as well. You know, you've got we've all got competition out there working in the same space that we work in and you know, and I know, you know from hearing the conversation.  With imaging last week that we all occupy different spaces of the same sphere. So, you know, it's it is hard. You know, we've watched the market go from just being us in a monopoly Market here for a you know, the first five six years. We had another computer you have another competitor enter and then another one and you know, and another one again, you know, they keep coming, but I think you've really got to just make sure that throughout the whole process that you stick to your guns and that you  Sure, that whatever you've planned to do or the space you plan to occupy. You work, you know you develop that brand nice to gain as much traction as you can as possible. Okay, another I guess broad is question. But I guess from the outside looking in often when you know, I'm looking at other stylist and I'm sure others do this as well. It's easy to see if we looking at his Instagram or you're a social medias that you kind of see the highlights and everything looks really great. And it's like a grass is green.  The sort of thing I'm certain that wouldn't be the case. And I guess the question is over the 13 years. If there was one thing that you would say has been the most difficult thing you've either had to learn or to deal with and you mentioned the Jeff said who so maybe that's part of it. But is there anything that comes to mind when I asked what's the most difficult thing you faced? Look it's I mean, I think the the Advent of social media is being both good and bad for business. You know, it's great in the instead of getting your message across certainly great.  Sharing things like your stories and your successes, but you're right. It's largely a smoke and mirrors tool, but it's also a tool that can be used to leverage business as well and to drive I guess aspiration towards your business or your brand and I think you know, we use social media quite heavily, you know, where we don't shy away from the fact that we leverage that as much as possible advertising space marketing is extensive.  So using something that's well been expensive or free is incredibly important. We found that over time as we've grown our audience that you know, it allows us to communicate to people who we probably wouldn't have reached before it allows us to tell stories about what we do more directly and more in a more engaged way and it's sort of helps us also engage our sort of second-tier kind of consumed which is the real estate agent. I  Engaging them in our social media posts. So look, if you're looking at something that was has been the most Blind by guest but Dynamic changing business. I actually do think it's social media for businesses like ours, you know, so things like the GFC of come and gone and we've all recovered from it, but you know moving forward if you're not part of the social media structure out there, you're going to lose potential ground in the future. It's a simple as that I think for us our view on that is you know it  It's all about branding reputation. You know, we'll call it whatever you want. But social media is just the best way to get people's attention in 2019 across various platforms. And I think it's important that people look at a number of platforms and figure out what works best for their business and and who they're trying to get in front of but yeah at the end of the day for us if you're if you're not thinking it's about brand in some way then you're only going to lose ground to those others out there. Yeah look and I think you know, we all suffer from the the phone.  Kind of effective social media and and and that you know, my furniture is not as good as theirs or my styling may not be as hot as there's on one particular day. But again, you know, the thing is that if you if you look past all that and you look to what social media can provide you, you know, we're starting to use, you know links back to campaigns for example for our agents. So the agents we work with, you know, fairly closely. We use the fact that we've got the followers on.  Graham for expert for example that allows us to add links back to their campaign so that we put up these pre images but the actual link, you know to swipe up goes back to a realestate.com listing for example. So what we're looking to do is leverage social media to make sure that we're part of a partnership of brand partnership with agents Much More Than Just A supplier. That's really interesting and I guess it's like say taking advantage of I guess an advantage that you have.  Given the number of followers you have and tools within Instagram that not everybody is going to have access to so it really is about and I think part of the problem is people look at others and kind of see what other people are doing. And a lot of the time it is just, you know, figure out what your own kind of strategy or your own thought process for this sort of stuff is how you want to leverage it in whatever way that is and kind of run your own race, but your head down and do your own thing. That's exactly what I look at you guys are fairly, you know, fairly active on social media, you know, there's there's there's no quick and easy solution.  You getting the followers behind you're getting the likes on each post or get in the comments, you know, Donny or Works day and night to make that happen. That's that's something that's it just doesn't come about you know, I I take all our photos for example, and we've always supplied photos to our agents and our clients for marketing as well. So we shoot every job at the end of it and we promote it on Facebook for example, but the images we use on Instagram a very different from those because we want that that polished look, you know, the images are  Process they're not straight out of the can. You know, there's no there's no shame in that. You can't just take a photo on an iPhone and hope and put it up on Instagram and say why the likes coming in you've actually got to do the work behind the scenes to make it make it all happen. Definitely. All right. I'm going to change tact a little bit. So in 2015, you should copy styling one the Tasmanian micro business award as part of the Telstra Business Awards, and I guess my I'm intrigued to know what  What the two parts to this what you got out of that process so simply being part of the process and submitting yourself for you guys as part of the potential to win the award. So what did you get out of that? And then secondly, was there any tangible impact that you guys saw as a result of winning the award, you know, we were able to leverage that in any way, I guess to give you some background to the Telstra Business Awards and it's going to sound like I'm a participant on the voice, but we had a really hard year that year the  14 was a really rough year for us and we had our daughter in hospital for six months and during that time Donnie. I was basically she was in there every day and I was sleeping at the hospital every night that time and we'll still trying to run a business and don't yell at that time was still a part-time pharmacist for a government department. So it was it was it was really quite hard on us and trying to manage a business. So I demand that time I  I'll stand to lose a bit of focus. I was getting pretty drained. And so we engaged a business coach to give us a bit of a hand and sort of try and find the light at the end of the tunnel and that was that was quite a good thing. But I guess the the reason we went for the Telstra Business Awards and it was much like starting a business. We were told not to do it. We were told it wouldn't work in 2006. We were told to pack up and keep our existing jobs, but the time a business coach also said we weren't ready for the business all Telstra business.  Awards so like everything else we did it and you know, it's not a failure to listen to people. It's just a bit when we're told no pushes this harder to find possibly roll something. Yeah, so it comes out of adversity in a lot of ways so we decided that we do it and you know, the Telstra Business Awards, but that time was it was it's about a 50 our commitment to make to get through the process of putting together.  Questionnaire and and submitting it, but the great thing about it along the way was that it made us look at our business probably seriously for the first time, you know in a true business fashion. That is who are we where are we going? What are we doing and how we planning to get there? And for us it was it was an amazing way to look back on our business develop data and history and statistics and determine you  You know what our business was going to be in the next five to ten years. And so the Telstra Business Awards was a great opportunity to find out all about our business and really find out about who we are as business owners trying to run this thing.  I've heard yeah, I guess you've probably given me an answer that I had heard in silver similar answers to other people have gone through a Awards process of any type like this and it really I mean that when you have to stop and really understand your business in a way that you need to be able to explain it in paper and in these forms, it really kind of it's a sort of thing that you think you know, but I often it takes sitting down and actually filling out some  something like this application form that it tells you these things that you probably didn't realize. Yeah, it did actually throughout the whole process of submitting the award. We're actually looking at things and start to answer questions name literally saying shit, we're not actually doing that. Let's figure out how we make that happen. So we'd stop doing the entry go left and sort of start working on on getting that element done so that we knew we had that part of our business underway and sorted and so what a  Is it refined our businesses business practice and it made us look at what was actually generating Revenue what was actually working. So instead of offering 10 crazy Services. We narrowed it down to three that we want to run with and you know, it meant that we weren't trying to be masters of everything. You know, we were looking to try and make sure that we had strong Revenue lines that generated good business. So it sounds like a man it probably was the majority of benefit of  actually submitting. It was just in understanding your own business who where you've been what you want to do, but I guess was there any component beyond that when you actually won the award that you feel like was there any tangible benefit the you can actually see because you're able to leverage that or just from recognition point of view anything like that. I think one of the big things I think probably one of the biggest thing that changed our business direction-- was at that point in time once we'd submitted the award. We've got through our daughter or Lana's price.  See hospital to some degree was that we made the decision that Donnie I was going to leave Pharmacy behind and come on full-time. And I think you know for business that was running, you know, it was running with me doing the full time kind of stuff and then danial part-time but and then I see evenings and weekends what it made us do is to say if we don't jump and make this happen now, it's forever going to be 1/2 business and I think the thing that we learned  At time was that moving forward. If you don't commit to making something happen, it just it won't happen. So grabbing a by the proverbial and and just making making it happen it. Also I think one of the big things is a gap is the recognition that we were heading in the correct direction where we're going the right way. We just needed to make sure that things were all ironed out and we had all our ducks in a row to really continue to grow but I think that answer your question. I think the  It was It was kind of interesting. We won the award and it was a Friday night and we're all super excited. We had our small team there where only a team of four at that point. We were super excited but the next morning will kind of expecting this Whirlwind of activity, but also was the Tumbleweeds rolling through and we were thinking what what's going on but what we realized is that again that winning these Awards is great, but you've then got to leverage it yourself if you don't  Taking from it. Okay, that's good advice and I think for those, you know, even considering something like this whether it's the Telstra Business Awards or any other version of there's an at the ey entrepreneur of the year that you know, there's a whole heap of things similar to that even if you know, as I said, I've been going through the process, but even if you stop and think about well, what would it be at what's involved in sitting down and actually putting this together? I think that could be really valuable thing. Even if it's not for the sake of an award or anything like that.  At it's quite valuable. It's having the background there to determine where your business is at and haven't measured externally by a third party. It makes a huge difference, you know, you know it just it you just identify all these things. You didn't realize existed, but then you've got that you've got the leverage then we went out and we ended up getting fortnightly article in the local newspaper just because of it, you know the so, you know, we became from that would be  I'm a you don't know any that Community is as the leader in that area. So that was kind of great. You know, you didn't mean we had something as a result of that award as well. Excellent. All right, a couple of questions left and then I will let you go. One of them here you had a video probably a month or two ago. Now we did a walkthrough of your Warehouse down there in Hobart. We you know, you kind of touched on already but you showed the storage and selection areas and all that sort of thing and I think the for my point of view, I'm sure you'll probably agree.  this but the amount of Engagement that you got from that from the Star Community was incredible and for us, you know, we're sitting here in our own kind of early version where where we've got our warehouse and we've got some of our stock and as I mentioned in our processes are still coming along and we're learning and everything but just from looking at a video like that that's a very aspirational sort of Target for us and I'm sure other stylist now like I guess I'm getting to my question because I also recall you mentioning that video that you were going to do another one at some point showing the ground floor in the  Building I wonder if you could just quickly for those either who haven't seen it or who are interested if you can describe just your building and maybe give a sneak preview of the other areas that weren't covered in that video. Okay, so we assume we've moved from space to space to space and never found anything. That's really perfect for what we do our last move. We went from a very dark dank kind of space 300 400 square.  Ladies, I think it was unfortunate had a lot trucks passing through it. So there's a lot of diesel dust and lot of residue and of course, it was destroying our furniture and was just dark. It wasn't very pleasant to be in but our landlord had a space above us which was first floor and that sort of terrified us a bit to start with the thought of going to a first-floor being at the mercy of a 3 by 3 meter elevator to get in and out of yayoi jobs in and out, but we were offered an  Rice and it had it was a sort of big Sawtooth roof with lots of natural light sand and you know, we took a fairly substantial space. We've been there for four or five years now and you know even today as we speak we're finally getting an office built there, you know, that's that's how exciting things are for us at the moment, you know, nothing's ever perfect. It may look perfect in these videos and so on but what we've done over that time is we've developed strategies.  Geez, and methodologies to get stock in and out as quickly as possible based on the fact that we have to use an elevator. And in fact, we actually share that space with a local Furniture retailer as well. So we occupy a space around 4,200 square meters combined and you'd only have to use one elevator to get all the stock in and out for deliveries. But the one thing we have learned is efficiency and that space so making sure that the stylus can get two stock quickly that the the  16 can get started in and out quickly and we will be doing more showcasing how that works. And when we're looking at doing a bit of a live-in so people can ask questions on how we do things as well. So we can do actually do a live answer kind of scenario and what people around the warehouse to see more so we'll we'll get we'll get around to that and we'll do more content on that to help people learn about I guess managing a warehouse space and making it as effective as possible.  It might be open to other stylist. That sounds very interesting to somebody like me. Yeah, well look, you know the process of managing stock and you know, it's something that a lot of properties dollars don't think about you know, they all want the warehouse and they all want to know you we all want space to put our stuff but the logistics is not a side that most people think about and you know in order to get stock in and out quickly. You've got to have the processes and the ability to lay out a floor plan that will maximize the  That you know incoming and outgoing stock. It's a simple as that certainly something we're learning here. Well, I look forward to seeing more and we'll be keeping an eye on that when the live event start. Yeah last question before I get into the dust of the rapid fire questions that we finish on something that we kind of touched on very briefly before we hit record was that you have an app that you are developing at the moment. What can you share with us about what the app is and who it might be four or and and I guess it's  - okay, so, you know I guess over time we've learned a few things about you know, who our Market is and who we're targeting working with social media does a fair bit to sort of Target. I guess direct client relationships and that's really important. But we're all about trying to develop longer-term real estate agent referral Partnerships. And in order to do that particularly in a highly competitive space where we're looking at ensuring  That we provide material to our agents that sort of help them sell not only sell the concept of I guess styling but also help sell us as a brand partner to their business. So what we've done is developed a an app that we will be sending live very shortly that agents will be able to use and log into to see all their eggs at their previous jobs with us and it will detail a lot of information on  the sales success of that property things like, you know asking price selling time the the young the the amount of dollars put into the project give them an idea, but that Apple also have the ability for the agent to do a live quote with their hand or directly. So it minimizes the time I guess we have to spend going out cold calling and sourcing work because the the quote will come directly through to us to follow up and so will have  I guess controlled potential work coming in that we can follow up on and and and and Maize and the guess the other thing is that it provides the the vendor or some really great images of what previous jobs have looked like so they've got something to measure with as well when they see the quote come through they can see the style of they'll get they can see projects. They've seen before, you know that have been done with that agent and they'll have a good idea of you know, how much  the project is going to cost them before they even get started. So it's not it's a way to allow agents to really engage and be part of our brand as well. So it's not just us trying to be part of their brand. Well, I'm intrigued I think one of the things that I've come to realize which I guess sounds obvious, but maybe I was a little naive is that we might have trouble in the early days and we still do pitching our own services and trying to sell home staging to to assert or  Under I just assumed that agents who already did styling knew how to do that and I've come to learn that there are many agents out there that themselves find a very difficult to to sell the idea of staging to a vendor that themselves and often do things like advertising costs in much higher priority. And if they can't even get that across the line, then they're not even going to mention home staging. So I think something like this sounds very valuable for agents in a you know, in a way that helps I guess sell the idea of it.  Yeah, well, that's right. I mean the idea really is to give the agents the confidence and also the understanding because there's nothing worse than when an agent goes in to sell the concept of styling and they go in and sell a 3-bedroom package for $2000. For example, you know, it's it's not you know, and so by the time you get to see the the vendor they've got $2,000 in their mind which just is not a price that you could match. So what we want to do is sort of rule out most that stuff and generate these sort of  Five leads to come through quickly and effectively that we can then work with to try and get the job done faster for these these the partner agency if you like was very intrigued and I'll you know, good luck with that. I'll be watching closely. I've gone a little over time. So I'm going to go very quickly through a couple of these rapid fire questions. I say that I've done this a few times now and every time I say, they're quick answers I end up trying to jump in and add more but I'll try not to do that today. All right, here we go.  Go so how has an e failure or an apparent failure situation for later success. I think one of the things that we've learned very quickly over time is that as we've developed our team is that you know, actioning things that are causing problems within our team the things that we've got to do so failing to do that is one of the biggest problems I think business can have specially in small teams. So if you don't address address any staff issues that then prolong and become bigger issues you've got  So our file is in the past have not been addressing those fast enough and making sure they're either sorted out or the problem is resolved by a team member sort of leaving. Basically. You don't need the grief in a small business. You've got to keep pushing forward in a tub with a tight team as quickly as you can as fast as you can very much like that answer and maybe they'll be a part to one day. We can dig into it a bit more. I want to ask more but I won't next one. What is one?  Under the best almost worthwhile Investments that you've made and that could be in the form of money or time or energy or anything else. I think for us for really was it was investment in our own Logistics team A Truck Van our guys, you know, we were at the mercy of contractors for a very long time, you know, we could have been we can be sitting there for two hours waiting for a removal instructor turn up that's running late after the put together a bed for a client before us or whatever. So for us the best investment ever.  Is taken control of our own inventory through having our own Logistics team moving stuff in and out so that we run to our own timeline and not the timeline of someone else. Okay, I would agree with that one. What advice do you wish you'd received when you started the business back in 2006. I think that probably the most important thing is for us would have been the whole concept around growth. Your growth is really important for a business but not to get  Big for be sake, you know find your own space and just manage that space. Well so that you're sticking to plans you sticking to your original goal and making sure that you know, you're not buying more inventory than you need. You're not pretty or more people than you need. You just doing it in a fashion that's of meets a manageable growth curve, I guess because otherwise what you're ending up doing is you just buying yourselves more and more problems.  Time and what's in the last couple now? What's a bad piece of advice or a recommendation that you do here in the home staging and styling industry. I think one of the things we sort of noticed particularly again, you know with a very overactive social media community in area in our space is is the the desire to have the most expensive and best inventory in the world. You know, it's sitting in your Warehouse. I think one of the big things I think  Able to understand is that you know the other day most people who are either your client or your who buys don't actually recognize that value that you're putting into top-end stock. I think having some toppings stocks really important to make sure you've got a good coverage but making sure you sort of mix it in with, you know other inventory that you've got so that you have a nice balance there somewhere. I think there's this over over thinking that goes on in our space and overspending the goes in a space.  Tablet this topping sort of stock. That's just absolutely not not necessary. It's good to have but it's not absolutely necessary to be from one particular supplier. That is all topping kind of even true. Okay, and the last one I've got for you is and this is more of a personal thing. And what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love we want to know. How weird you. Are. You see, this is this is the thing. This is the thing with the property style including whether we're just a bit OCD and like to be bit vanilla is  As Imogen said last time look, we don't probably have anything that's terribly exciting apart from loving to go back into the warehouse on a Saturday morning to tidy up and get it sorted again for the week, which is pretty sad and itself but you know, I guess realistically, you know, we don't because we work so hard at it all day and all night. It seems you know, there's not a lot of time for us time still, you know, so doing the things that we always want to do, you know, we have our interests outside work, but  unfortunately, they're just not that exciting fair enough fair enough and I I could come and dance mom and dad to a daughter which is absolutely wonderful. You know, there's nothing better than standing in a hole with a bunch of screaming mums. So, you know, that's pretty exciting but not that crazy. Well, I can certainly relate to the the weekend coming in on this. There's something special about being in the warehouse on Sunday when it's all quite and and kind of getting things ready. I can definitely relate to that one. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.  All right. I'll let you off the hook on that one. We might we might have a think about that for a round to one day Adam. Thank you very much for coming the show. I really appreciate the time that you've given up to me. As I said, I've got a little over time. The last question I have for you though is where can people who either want to follow along with your journey. Maybe ask some questions or reach out. What's the best way that they can do that? Well, I look we have a pretty broad coverage but your Instagrams always the best place, you know, and we're handle is shift property Style.  Letting you know that's probably the best place to see what we do and see who we are. Excellent. All right. Well look, I'll let you go. And for those listening, please think Adam let him know what that you had a listening and maybe ask him a question or two if there's anything that I should have asked that I haven't and thank you Adam. My pleasure. Thanks Joe.
Hello and welcome to another episode of get out a rat today. I'm in London with Joe Garland who is senior manager Operational Support customer contact for John Lewis, Joe. Hello? Hi Martin. Thanks for giving up your time. Great to be here. So let's start with a little bit about you for those people that don't know you long title John Lewis. How long have you been at John Lewis? So I've been with a John.  Lewis partnership 22 years this September and but with John Lewis about five years having started my career with waitrose, okay for the other division of the partnership and how about getting into contact centers? What was that? Well, it's probably a long it's quite a long story. So I try to kind of cut it down a little bit. It was completely by accident and having spent 15 years managing shops within waitrose and  Opportunity came up in the bracknell head office to run the contact center for waitrose for six month period which I took on really enjoyed it was just a fantastic experience totally by accident and I can remember my first day walking through the door and realizing that everybody was on a phone. So that shows my lack of knowledge about what contact centers are actually about but my  Philosophy was very much around the customer needs to be served. And if they want to what queuing at a teal or queuing up the phone, there's no difference. So employed the tactics. I would have done within running away trying to shop which proved to be quite successful. So you spent 15 years doing retail shops. Yes, and then that transition from there into contact centers lutely. And what was the thinking behind that?  Just I'm going to do I want to do something different or absolutely was an opportunity that presented itself and I got bit of a tap on the shoulder from honest and if I win but wanting to do something different but still wanting to work with people and being customer focus which is which is really important and something that I love to do. But unfortunately, that's the comment came to an end. It was only six months. So I went off to do a job for  a little waitrose opening the little white rose on shelf or quartz. So another completely different role where I used to Don a hard hat and boots and go and measure out car parking spaces on shell for court. So I really enjoyed that because that was also really different and but then when a job was advertised for strategy and change manager for the John Lewis contact center operation, I decided to go for that because I  Of that job so much in waitrose. I thought be great to see from the John Lewis side as well. So we you take all of these kind of different experiences, but all being customer-focused. You must have come at contact centers with a slightly different view than maybe someone that had been there as an agent and then sort of come up that way. Yeah, absolutely and I think when I when I was actually first in the contact center and waitrose and could feel  Some of the agents getting quite frustrated with the branch Partners not answering queries quick enough when we needed to refer the query to Branch. I could really empathize because I've been in that shop with, you know people at the tills queuing with it where they're there and you've got to serve them. There's nobody in the warehouse check the stock levels. So absolutely could understand it from from both sides of the coin, which was really useful. I think anyone the way you can see  Static that's based on experience as well. So you're able to educate the contact center teams that you are running and then when you dip back into retail do the same that way as well absolutely. So it was it's really good. I think any experience wherever your career takes you you always learn something if even if you end up not in that not in that space I suppose so from there then we're so then I moved into John Lewis contact centers, which was a was.  Quite a transition if I'm honest So Gone from running a at the time in waitrose was a 200 head 250 head contact center with a small Outsource operation into John Lewis, which was a 2,000 head operation. So the scale was huge. The process is were particularly complex lots of different lines of work. So it's very very different and I was in a space. That was a knock.  And also for the first probably time in my career, I wasn't managing massive teams from an operational perspective. I was very much developing the strategy and managing the changes that went into the contact center to make sure they went in smoothly. It's a change in scale daunting. It was yes. It was I just didn't know what was going on because I do, you know, if I'm honest I started the role feeling loved and a contact center quite so  Tastefully, so this would be fine and it was it was it was very different very different. I mean the scale and the complexity more so I think because John Lewis is quite a complex organization and and the contact center service a number of you know, a huge number of functions a huge number of propositions, so you could have an agent there would be answering questions.  His own what is the flavor of soup in Cheadle right the way through to how do I access a beauty appointment or my kitchens gone wrong? So no huge a huge variety and for somebody quite new in to John Lewis to get their head around that was quite it was quite a transition. So, you know, I imagine you had kind of some support around you but how do you go past the daunt that you know being daunted by I can remember actually failing in  an interview purely because I was looking for that step up. So I'd managed like you about a hundred feet up to 300 but then this was a thousand and I can remember just as you've been talking about it. I can remember my answer when somebody said so how do you think you're going to deal with the increasing number and I even though inside I was petrified. I was quite blasé and I said, well, I'm sure of my ability and processes and and stuff like that, but it didn't.  Wash at all think they just thought yeah, he has no idea. So what did you do? How did you go about I suppose the other differences it was a different role. But you know, if he really fits been an operational role I suppose you just you just scale that up. But what I did was quite quickly make connections with people you learn who you can draw information from it.  Including your old contacts and and you're just really open and honest with the fact that you don't you don't know everything. Yeah, and with any role whatever level you are. There's always a period of transition and you know, one of my philosophies is about reaching out to people being really open and asking for for support and help when you need it, but also really trying to celebrate the quick wins. So at a time, where you  You're not really clear on what you should be doing. I think it's a great great idea to think about something you can do really well and do that because if any think not only does it give you credibility for the people around you but also makes you feel an awful lot better. So, you know, I'd quite a lot of experience with talent development and you know Talent calibration with in my trouser used to lead on that. So I let on that in in the in the directorate  but in retail head office because I was I could do that. So gave me a little bit of credibility and enabled me to think actually I can really add value because that's really important to me. Even if you don't exactly know what you're doing all of the time feeling the you can add value in what is in the calibration. So we're you look at same as calibration for okay. Yeah, but when you are grading people for aarp's, you know your annual  He's also really looking at what does it actually mean to be a very good so taking out the taken away the individual perspective of that that individual but looking at what sort of things does a person who's very good. What have they been doing? And then somebody from another function describes what they've been doing and you really get a feel for that that level of grading because we all know it's quite subjective. Yeah, and I had a lot of experience with being able  Able to kind of chair those kind of sessions certain kind of cross functions as well. So brilliant. Okay. Yes. Oh so you had some kind of reassurance and you could reassure all the partners that that that level they are p gradings and the talent gradings were absolutely being talked about at a senior level and people have a similar level. We're doing similar things to get a similar grade and that's great because I guess you from that then  You're able to refine the ingredients of what good looks like regardless of the functionality that they're taking absolute lie. Okay, that's great. So then from there then so yes, so and then so the strategy and change role was you know, I still was still got part of that role, but this is just it was a beast of a role and we went from I suppose of  Ocean waves, there's probably six of us to start with which group which doubled and it doesn't seem a lot of people and it didn't feel like a lot at all. But we were effectively developing their future strategy for the contact centers for John Lewis, but the biggest chunk of the work was around ensuring that every single function in John Lewis when they wanted to make a change one knew that the contact centers were there.  Are and whatever they did would absolutely affect the contact center. So a changing proposition. We need to retrain most of the people on the phones because they might get query about it. So it took quite a while to ensure that all the stakeholders in Victoria where we're sitting now understood the contact centers understood. We were there and understood the impact. So I understood the whole customer journey and what was going to be the impact on the customer and therefore the impact.  The contact center at the end of The Journey usually when it goes wrong, but also just if they've got a query and there was no process in place to manage this so we developed a like governance process so change a change process and it's now fully fully embedded within the contact centers and we've got to change request form. We have a change form a group and so essentially what  That means is that every single change that anybody wants to make in John Lewis, if it's going to affect the customer it comes through my team and you know wrote very proud that that process was 1 1 office in a wall to the European contact center walls last year and just to recognize that you know, the tough work that's been developing that process and getting that on everybody's radar how much of that was.  About awareness and perceptions and I guess both ways as well. Yeah, there is it was absolutely surreal. A lot of it was about the awareness of contact centers and the impact and also the important thing is around building that relationship with the stakeholder. So we have got when they're developing their business plans. We can be around the table to say that's great you would like to do that. But have you had  You understood the impact on the customer the impact on the customer Journey. So at an early stage, we can before any developments done. We can absolutely influence that process and we're now at that stage where we my team of got great relationships with a business development managers for the different functions so we can begin to get in earlier on so we no longer receive a change request and think maybe after the event. Yeah after the event or that's not going to work and then  Have to go back. So it's less wasted effort. So we built those relationships over the last three or four years to really begin to get into people's on people's Radars a little earlier some of that kind of routine Cadence or how much is have you sort of make the balance between strategic and the more being able to react quickly and yes, so we've actually is interesting questions. So we have got a BYU process which is the more run.  Male, we've got a longer-term lead time and but we've also got a fast track process. So with all the best will in the world if John Lewis wants to do a promotion and it's the right thing to do for the customer contact centers can't say actually, you know, you're not going to be able to do we're not ready or not. They take because we would always been ready. So that's a really good question. So we've developed a fast track process so we can expediate that. But what we do is we've got stakeholders.  From the contact center function on a weekly call to really get to grips with every single aspect that's needed for that change. So we have the resource planning. We've got the telephony manager. We've got the training guys. We've got the quality guys to everything we would need to do for a change whether it's a small process change or whether it's a change in the CRM system change everybody build around that table. So we make sure we don't drop the ball. Great. Let's go.  Kiss XO the awards. Can you just remind what was who was who was doing the awards? And what was it for the award was the European contact center customer service award, which is hosted by the contact center management association. It's brilliant Association and the award dinner was held last November and my strategy and change team won the award for most effective.  Business transformation award. We won silver pick to the post by and Shop direct who are with Fab. We've also we visited them to find out what what they what they did better than us. But anyway, you visited them afterwards. Yes, obviously been to get some best practice but winning silver was just amazing really it's just so proud of the achievement because that's a process we've developed the team has developed over the last few years.  I'm really felt we got the recognition that that it really deserved. So this is this was a culmination of years of work. Right? What was the point where you're identified and thought you know what I think we should go in for an award because even just doing that is kind of you must you must mentally be thinking. Yeah, we've got something here. Absolutely. I think it came to the point where we were we weren't  really getting any requests that we had to push back on and any requests. We didn't know and all of a sudden everybody was in the process where with the process and there was a period of about three months versed to Alice in my team. I think we've cracked this now so now we're into the space of actually we just need to develop and refine rather than go and talk to that person. Yeah, because they're not following the process. Yes. It was it was a great moment.  But presenting the actual doing the presentation to the judges was just was it was quite nerve-wracking but I was just so proud that we could tell our story. Yeah, it's really really good. And what was that? Who did you sort of take with you on that Journey? What is the core team? So the core team the team has changed a little bit now, but the core team at the time were so Alice is my direct reports. She's my was my business development manager.  And Becky who works for me. She's becomes specialist a Becky is owns the change process and a lot of that work was the three of us working on that but Becky's got to take a lot of the credit for you know, the groundwork and the redefining the process and the communication around that and Alice would be the voice in Victoria making sure that all our stakeholders are engaged. So the award even just going through it and then winning silver and something like that.  Will you you've mentioned a couple of times where you mentioned going to see somebody else in the CCM a and people like that how much and at what point did you start looking external? Because naturally in the role that you've described and knowing the work that you've done it's hundred miles an hour 24/7. When did you start sort of factoring in looking externally and seeing what's out there over and above your kind of your world I suppose.  my team  So so when we become more involved with the CCM a and more involved with the Institute of customer service as well, and so both of those institutions provide fantastic networking opportunities. And so you would go you go to an event you talk to somebody and I think the benefit of these events and the special interest groups that the CCM Iran is everybody's really open and shares their Journey.  And you just make connections from there. So I've been everywhere. So we've been across the country looking at quality looking at Learning and Development looking at change processes and really learning from other businesses. And that's not to say other businesses have got it. All right, everybody's on a journey as well. But just so interesting to see from a different perspective and that is such an important part of what we do I think in any industry  Particularly in contact centers where it's quite it's very fast-moving people are at different stages to to be able to learn from different businesses is just is just really really useful how much of that plays a part in kind of your own view of your development and career personally and lending itself to sort of mentoring because I know you're very passionate about your people coaching.  Going external how much of that has kind of made you go. I if I was to talk to myself 10-15 years back or longer. What would you be saying? And what's that kind of do same Reach Out externally because people are very very generous with their time and I've reached out to a couple of senior leaders in different businesses recently and everybody's been really really Keen to share their knowledge and share their  And a lot of the time that is just through an introduction for Mutual colleague and I've reached out to people just by LinkedIn. I developed a learning program last year and saw a post on LinkedIn which really resonated with some of my thinking and so I reached out to the individual who works in the foreign office. I'll see if I could buy him a coffee and he's like come and share with me what you've done. It's just brilliant.  And being able to it gives you it gives it really gives you some reassurance as well that you're along the right path, even though you know you are but it's great to have that external reassurance. Not just in the John Lewis in the John Lewis world. So I think something like that. It's I've even though it was called a thing, but this kind of about imposter syndrome and how when you're maybe starting out in management and you're thinking I remember  Talking to someone and it was only through actually going through some really difficult times not necessarily Awards and things like that, but he said something to me. We kind of met each other maybe five years apart. I mean that five years I've worked abroad but I've been made redundant and all of these different things and it was only through going through stuff like that, but I thought I kind of do know what I'm talking about and he said to me you look different I said, how did what do you mean am I thought it was going to talk about losing my hair or or something?  But he actually said because he'd always been or when I knew him. He was a part of the senior leadership team and I was kind of operational mid-management and he said you've gone from looking at the floor to look him in the eyes and it was it stuck with me. It's stuck with me because I thought not that I regret anything. But if I could talk to or some even through a medium like this if there's people out there that think they don't deserve to be in that position, but they feel comfortable.  Ball and knowledgeable. I was knowledgeable and comfortable but there were so many times when I thought I don't belong in this room. When actually the reason you're in the room is because you're going to bring something different. Absolutely and I think when you're going for your career, especially on that is very natural to feel like that and all the people you see around you that look really confident the feel that they know the answers are probably feeling that that's well, but you don't realize that until you begin to come.  Out the other side and I suppose the biggest thing that really helped me was coaching. So so a number of points in my career. I've had a coach. We're very fortunate in the partnership to have a coaching bank. So there are a number of trained individuals in the partnership who are credited by association of coaching quite a rigorous program and they are available for  Anybody in the poll levels all levels and you you go on it's like a profile you contact that person quite bright. So here is that there's definitely no swiping - it's not but you set up chemistry meeting. Okay, and you pick a coach you decide on a coach that can help and that can be through telephone coaching face-to-face coaching. We're looking at launching group coaching as well. And that's  that has been quite pivotal in my career. So, you know coaching can really help you unpick what the blockers are to you actually internally feeling as confident as you would like to feel and that that's really helped me. I think at various points throughout my career so much so that I trained as a partnership coach like the year before last and now coach within the partnership supporting others, which is just fantastic in different functions in a different location fact.  Division side waitrose group John Lewis branches head office telephone visiting just just a complete variety of individuals that I coach on a number of issues not just work related as well. There could be personal issues as well. And the coaches are safeguarded by coaching supervisors. And you know, we're well trained in how to deal with deal with issues, but it's just fantastic.  You really feel that you are supporting people on a different level than just being a leader of the team. Which great scheme. It's absolutely fantastic. You're your own team must benefit from the fact that you go through this have all of these skills are do they they part of that as well. Absolutely. So I've always had even before I was trained always had quite a coach in approach to Leading a team feel very strongly about empowering people to make their own.  And so the coach and is dis refined my we find my skills. So, you know, I can I can get really understand where people are coming from by the language. They use for their body language the words. They use know how they're just their demeanor in the room. But also what they're not saying, so that's that's a really important a really important skill so so my team  If it from it also looking at launching group coaching in the Partnerships and with another guy from waitrose. We're leading a pilot. What would that look like? So the pilot is around so coaching up to 10 people and so for different maybe a different type of cake. So the important thing we coaching to remember is that there is no right or wrong answer and you don't go away over handout. It's  Much about the conversation in that room. And so the pilot we're looking at is a working parents pilot. So we've got a working parents Network within the Partnerships and number of many networks. And we're looking at running a pilot for parents with children of similar ages or parents of children of any age to see which works best. So those guys can get together and really talk openly about the challenges of having a job caring for children.  The same time and how does that work? And I think the recognition that you know, people have got a lot going on outside work but the point of group coaching as well, which is so important is you you're able to build up with a group that support network. Yeah. So as a coach you are, you know, you're standing back and you're facilitating the conversation but those guys are building those relationships. So if they're in a similar situation, they can absolutely reach out to each other and get that support. So  Of a sudden the capacity of the coaching Bank goes it can go tenfold because you can you can use group coaching as an intervention which is could be quite different from Individual coaching. But you can use it for more people for similar topics. I imagine that's got so many benefits, but you've got to start doing it to actually build up that group knowledge a historical knowledge because I guess it comes back to one of your points around.  Leadership and being vulnerable and saying you don't know because you might think people might bring to that session something that you don't instantly have the answer to but through the discussion something evolved. That's what I am Groot coaching is not  Randy it's not around the answer. So a lot of the time it's just around sharing and the benefit of saying it out loud and the benefit of being able to be open in a safe environment and being supported by the individuals. So I've run group coaching sessions for team managers. We did something on what a big scale last year for the team manager population in John Lewis the contact centers and the benefit was in the room absolutely in the room.  And we're doing something similar with some of the senior leaders this year around actually we can sign post some of the great stuff that John Lewis stars in terms of procession of look at how to write a good PDP we can sign post where that is, but the real learning comes from everybody talking to each other about what's worked what hasn't and somebody say actually I'm not sure you should be doing it like that and they're not realizing so it's just fantastic. How how would someone who's listening to  Open like this and think this is assuming there's someone listening think this this is this is brilliant, but there's an investment. So there's how is that being achieved that I'm assuming? This is in work time? Yes, and naturally the benefits that would seemingly be obvious that you have more well-rounded developed employees across functions feeling engaged performing well, but at some point someone's  active said we need to do this and we need to take people away from the daily firefighting to just take time be present and be mindful and I think that you spot on and I think coaching all the coaches within jailed and waitress do it as part of their day job and the coaching time can be within work time, but the benefits are coaching.  Learning and Development kind of intervention are quite hard to quantify because there's so many other things that could have an impact but it's the well-being of the partners that so important and and having an opportunity to speak openly about things affecting them work or personal and things are blocking their development. It's a coaching is an intervention can be absolutely so effective with somebody with, you know, potentially with confidence issues that we discussed earlier or some  He's having a problematic, you know relations work relationship. So you can really begin to pick it apart and help the client see from another person's perspective as well. So it's not sometimes it's around a change of behavior or change in mindset or just being able to see see something from somebody's other point of view, but I think when you're in that situation, it's really hard to bring yourself out of that and be able to reflect on what's going on.  And that coach provides the mirror to provide that reflection for that individual and about our chairman Charlie Mayfield absolutely called out that last year last year or the year before that coaching was vital for the success of the partnership. So if you're in a progressive culture, like here is then you still have a mountain of work to do to get to get it effective and Spark kind of sharing your wins with people and saying this is really working.  Gagging what advice would you give to someone who maybe is in a culture where they don't feel this would be well received as a as a concept. The thing that I find is that you've got to be authentic and you've got to be true to yourself. So every well, I know this is probably not right but, you know, every culture should have the should have the ability to be able to share.  Things and that may always not be true. But I think if you if you truly believe that's the right thing to do then that may not be the culture for you. That sounds quite harsh. But I think if you want to see if you want to share things and be open then hopefully you'll be able to do that within your normal work environment or you can find a coach externally, but obviously that comes at a cost if if it's not provided by the business.  Yes, but I think there's always opportunities to influence if you can understand the if you can understand the benefits and you can prove those benefits, there will always be somebody I truly believe that would listen that you can beat you can influence a different way of doing business. I suppose. I think that's true. I mean, it's finding what it is that influences the senior leadership and you touched on it before about the importance of establishing an external network or  I think there's always something about you go away and maybe you come back and say to senior leadership. Guess what? Everyone is doing XYZ. It's this kind of like fear of missing out salute, isn't it? So even if they're not fully bought into and I think we've all dealt with people that are probably weary of that even though we're in an industry that's constantly about change. You know, it's kind of like our what's the what's this latest thing that you're you're going to be talking?  To me about but but you're right. I think if you  It's one of the science of persuasion isn't it? If you can absolutely demonstrate you demonstrate the benefit and it's that some of that has got to be financial and you can absolutely demonstrate what other businesses are doing externally. Look at the new thinking that's coming out around whatever it is you're trying to influence on if you can create a compelling case and as you say make the senior leadership  ship concerned that they're behind the times then you've got being with us surely. So, you know, we if you look at your successful if a successful team that's won an award you're doing some great things coaching is very important to you. What are some of the other pillars that you lean on your foundations as to what's important and that if you know through this or mentor and or anything like that, but you'd want to share  I uh suppose the things that I've learned and I haven't always been great at them for One S. But the things I've learned that I think has made me successful. It's absolutely The Importance of Being Yourself at work. I am the same person at work as I am at home. I wear slightly smarter shoes. I would have made that's about the only difference but I am taught an open person. I wear my heart on.  On my sleeve and I think I find it natural easy to share if you think that's just who I am, but I do think it's it. It's really important to be authentic because then you're just who you are. You don't have to worry about all my God. I should have said that if I'm at work actually if you're just who you are. That's that's really important. And that's probably come to me in the last five or six years through some great feedback. So feedback is one of the  Key things I think is just absolutely vital. So not just requesting the feedback. We should be requesting it all the time not just at your annual review, but also giving that feedback always with a positive intent. So how did that person's interaction make you feel if you take if it's always got to be personal in the first person, you know, everyone knows how to give feedback but I do feel that's just so important.  That you help people develop through through what you've observed but also receiving that feedback but not just from your line manager. So I would you know, ask for feedback from the people in my team my peers people I've worked with before and I don't think that really reflects any weakness. It reflects for me reflects the strength. I'm receiving all this this Rich knowledge about myself and how I'm perceived from a variety.  Few people over it with any three back. It is a gift and you can decide to unwrap it or just to check it over the fence and that's absolutely fine. But that's been really important to me and I suppose the other the other thing is around with flexion. So ever to lend themselves, absolutely Colorado. I'm a real advocate of reflection and it's one of those things always falls by the wayside if you're too busy, so see my diary every week.  And I quite simply reflect on first thing. I reflect on his what I've done really well that week. So what have I achieved then what am I missed opportunities? And then what am I? What's my priorities for the following period and that is sometimes around my PDP is sometimes around task and sometimes it doesn't really matter what it's around its around reflecting on how you're feeling what you've achieved.  What you've learned and I suppose but I might have felt early on in my career. I'm a natural learner. I love learning new things. I love experiencing new things. So I would go I would read research articles. I've read all these books. I didn't really know what I was doing with them. So I'd read all this stuff and then we wouldn't go anywhere and I suppose now I really asked myself. Honestly. What a fine what have I achieved? What if I learn, but more importantly what difference does that made?  So what difference is it made to the business? But what what can I do now that I couldn't do before and it's that that important distinction around absolutely understanding what you've done and what's the impact that's the important because a lot of people doing the first bit but then we don't go to the final piece and that's that's okay. So do you your team be used to you because I guess if you just with feedback different ways of doing it informally for  Emily with some routine or just kind of again tactically based how do you help your team's overcome that first Turtle because I think there's something you'd like to say feedback to gift. But for some people it is the worst possible thing. They can imagine doing certainly I've even more recently read a book called Insight by Tasha Urich and it  it says in all of her studies. So she's a new she's a doctor. I think in a regular writer of the New York Times. She thinks self-awareness gained from feedback and reflection. Yes is the key distinct determinate of between those people that are successful to a point and those that kind of without getting my Buddhist in a way but truly enlightened and it's a common denominator and  She makes some really interesting observations. And again this seems like it's something that's just part of who you are. What about fear? So that question what about for your team's where maybe someone buys into you buys into what you do with the team wants to further their career but struggles with feedback because they personalize it. Okay, so I suppose  Just a couple of things firstly. I am really good at recruiting great people and my team fad and one of my key requirements is open and honesty so really set that clear expectation from the start so they can stay I might struggle with feedback and you help me. Yeah, absolutely absolutely support them. And anybody new joins the team  Over level they are will sit with them and say these are my expectations and I will be giving you feedback whether I'm do your direct line manager or not. And and I expect the same back but I build those relationships with a team to break down those barriers and because some of the Timur quite new to the table would find that quiet would find it odd, but by me building the relationships being open and authentic talk  In about my dog my children and and really building that relationship with people and always delivering on what I say. So it's about making people feel comfortable and also giving people the tools to say actually if you're giving people feedback. You keep it really relevant to the Pacific point then it and you're talking about the impact on you. You're not actually if you're doing it with positive and 10. It's not need it shouldn't be an issue.  Can never be an issue. So yeah, I think my team are there they're all fine with it. Well, that's what they tell me. Anyway, that's me feedback the contrary I guess but for people that might one of the key differences from certainly when we started to now is the access to resources the access to key information about how you might want to approach something right but to your earlier point if anyone's in  Any doubt then they can reach out to you. And you know, I've got two great direct reports Allison Stephanie look after the two areas of my function who have had coaches themselves. So they've got lots of people to reach out to and we work very much as A3 and so they reach out to anybody and we cover each other. So we've got a great team ethos built around a common purpose and a common belief.  The old my team have signed up to so it makes everything quite straightforward because everybody's really clear on what they're doing. But but even more important the way that we should the way that we do that in Operational Support. Everybody's really clear on the purpose of Operational Support, which is which is fantastic and what else then so we talked about the other thing about authenticity as well. What do you have you ever had people challenge your around?  That there it's not the reverse or it doesn't mean you can't develop that you can still be the same person, but maybe you just exhibit different behaviors or you you become more consistent between let's say an outside version of yourself and a Works. I'd always be and that works for some people and that's not to say my way is the right way. I just find it. It's just easier because you don't need to remember who what  What hat you're wearing? Yeah, I'm I'm he get there. Obviously there was going to be differences slight differences, but I would have a conversation with a member of my team in exactly the same way. I would have a conversation with a friend and that's not to say my team my friends as important distinction, but it's just the authenticity and the benefit that derives is just it's just right so that that for me is really important, but you know  Some things work for different people and absolutely you would have more of a professional Persona I suppose but isn't my point is around when you're completely different and people don't really know you outside of work at all. And for somebody my value around being very open and honest that would that would not work for me. So your what's next for you in terms of your personal purpose or your team's purposes or  What's the future look like? We've sought with salted on our Harbors the take the team is great. You know, we've moved from being just a strategy and change function. We've now got quality and training and a customer show Lawrence function as well. So the team has grown is that a recent change or it last year. So the team the team grew last year to make us Operational Support, but having that common purpose with soap important because we were bringing together three separate teams, so  So even though we work in different areas, we've all got a common goal. So that's really key. And I suppose in terms of my personal purpose just so we just did you verbalize so you bringing together teams that have developed their own mannerisms and common ways of working. Absolutely. You don't want to change that but you need to bring it into together with some of it didn't need to be modified because we've been working as three separate teams, but it was around  Absolute taken the Fantastic bits of everything that everybody did putting them together, but then we're not the old strategy and changed him not the old quality and trained team. We are Operational Support. So it's around how can those three functions really really work well together. So now for example the feedback from the customer the customer Assurance team received from customers feeding to freeze into the strategy phase into our training.  Latisse it's in the middle of everything so if we've got a quality operation, so that's like a key point for everything. So we did need to bring it together and we had a quite a big event at the beginning of the year where we found a purpose. So we spend two days really finding common ground agreeing on a goal traits kind of agree on a goal of we're 25 of you is a challenge, but we got there.  People who signed up to what we're doing. And as I said more importantly the way that we do business and the service we provide to the contact center function and the service we provide to The Wider business as well. Great. I'm sorry. I interrupted you when the personal purpose. I mean, I think that's probably my final point is around if you can find the purpose you have personally it just makes everything really easy. So quite early on in fact all of my  My career I've always been involved and really enjoyed and being passionate about developing and leading people but a couple of years ago. I really wanted to kind of investigate a little bit further what that meant and spent quite a long time. I worked with a coach as well. It was one of those conversations what where's my career going? What's happening with this actually wasn't around. What's the next job? It was around. What is your what is your  Purse what is that purpose? And once you've got that then everything else just falls into place. So my purpose is around absolutely supporting people to be the best. I can be and once I'd put my finger on that, it's quite simple as I put my finger on there then everything else. I don't need to make a decision on because it's just obvious what I need to do. So, I don't really need to get advice about empowering people or consider.  Delegation how I delegate people how I delegate to people it all comes quite naturally because I really understand my purpose around enabling people to be the best. They can be I would I would like to be in your team. I think I'd love love love to thank you. This has been brilliant. Hopefully, you're definitely come back and we can do it again because I think there's so many different things that we've just touched on that. I know people would find helpful. I've learned something today. I've learned Lots today. So thank you Joe Garland very much. Thank you Marty.  By the time they worry. Thanks.
Class is in session. You're listening to squat University by dr. Aaron horse Shake. Now. Let's start the show according to Trenton is manic depression settled and flipping in the fantasy. Hey, what's up podcasters? Thank you so much for checking out Today Show. This is episode 68 of the squat University podcast the goal with each and every one of these shows is to bring you as much value pad content help you move better in the gym and in life decrease your body's aches and pains and help you reach your true athletic potential. Now have you ever heard the expression a picture is worth a thousand words. It means the meaning or idea behind something can be summed up better in a single image than a lengthy description. Now the phrase itself should not have any place in the diagnosis of back pain. However, the way in which our current Medical Society works as far as diagnosing pain is often used with this phrase and we'll talk about that today. Tell me if this story sounds  Familiar to you you're lifting at the gym one day trying to go heavy and all of a sudden have this back injury something just feels like it pops. You're hung up with back pain for a couple days sometimes even weeks. So what do you do you decide to go to the doctor. Now first off usually takes a little bit of time to get it into the doctor. Usually don't just go straight to the doctor unless you have a great relationship with one or you go to the emergency room for most of us. We're not going to the emergency room with just back pain things start hurting me call up a doctor you make an appointment.  Takes a little bit you get in finally see a doctor after waiting for like an hour in the weight room. They look at you. They ask you a couple questions. They don't even touch you and then you go. All right. Well, let's order an MRI and see what you find. So then you have to wait a little bit to finally get your MRI scheduled with first off is not cheap. Then you get your MRI and you have to finally reschedule with the doctor so that you can find out what the MRIs basically showed. So you meet with them a couple weeks later and he goes  As well after reviewing your scans, we found that you have a bulging disc.  Sound familiar. This happens all the time doctors often today diagnosed back pain simply by looking at an expensive picture of your spine, which essentially is what an MRI is now if you had like a car accident or something else, I was very traumatic injury like a large fault. Obviously, it makes sense that we're looking for huge fractures or things like that with an MRI. So going straight to that can be very helpful at that time, but for the common back injury, especially  Lifting we cannot only look at an expensive picture of your spine and think that's the best way to diagnose injury you see many medical practitioners today commonly seek out these abnormal findings like a bulging disc on an MRI and interpret them to be recent developments presuming that these specific tissues are the source of a person's pain. Basically if they see something that looks off on the scan like an MRI.  They assumed it to be the exact anatomical cause of your newly developed paint. Now the presumption that these abnormalities on Imaging can be directly linked to the cause of pain is actually flawed for a couple reasons first results on Imaging actually have very poor correlation to the symptoms of pain the MRI cannot show if the damage is a new wound or an old scar pathology does not drive.  Mention the fourth reason the MRI only shows Anatomy. It does not show function. So let's dive into each one of those presumptions in why those are incorrect and why the MRI is not the only way that we should go about diagnosing back pain. Now, what if I told you that finding a bulging disc is actually one of the easiest to catch abnormalities with an MRI of the spine. It's true. In fact many people are walking around today with the disc bulge who have absolutely  Zero back pain. How can that be? Well, if you actually look at the research, there's some that shows that it is estimated that almost a third of healthy pain-free 20 year olds currently have a disc bulge in their spine in this number of disc bulges actually increases 10% every decade meaning every 40 year-old up out there half of them likely has a disc bulge in his yet not having any back pain at all. I'm 32 years.  Old I probably have a couple disc bulges. If you were to take an MRI my spine another research article that has been very eye-opening in 2006 a group of researchers collected MRI scans of 200 individuals without any history of back pain now during the study those who developed severe back pain with in the months following that original MRI had new MRIs taken and the results were compared with the previously taken scans.  Now here's what surprising 84% of those who developed back pain during that time had absolutely zero difference in their spine scans from the original one. Some people even had improved markers compared to their first demo right now. Clearly This research is showing that just because an abnormal finding is picked up on an MRI. It does not necessarily mean it is the root cause of your pain now when you see a bulging  Disc on an MRI there is no way a radiologist can determine if it is due to a recent event, which we would call like a wound or if it's basically a 20 year old wound a scar. Basically. This is because disc bulges can heal over time and no longer currently generate pain, even though they can still be seen by an MRI. Now what's important to understand is that an injury to the spine is different than an injury to the knee or hip?  An injury to the spine sets off this Cascade of events often. For example, when the spine is compressed under load a healthy disc helps distribute that load evenly across the entire vertebral bone. So if you put a big weight on your back your back squatting the disc itself actually acts sort of like an airbag. So when the spine is compressed it sort of pushes the load not to one part of this.  Fine, but sort of distributed amongst the entire disk or the entire vertebral spine when a disc bulge occurs load is no longer evenly distributed but instead it's actually shifted to the posterior part of the spine called the facet joints. So wall pain from a disc bulge can eventually burn out in a couple weeks or months the mechanics of how the spine functions is actually instantly changed from there on so the way in which the spine carries low  Load after this quad show you had a disc bulge in May and then in October you're starting to develop some paintings because your spine has actually changed the way in which it carries load. It's been affected at that particular segment. Basically from then on out whenever you're loading force on your spine instead of it being evenly distributed on them part of the spine. It's now being shifted a lot of the forces being shifted to the back part of the spine, which is called the facet joints. Therefore if someone at that  Time so why not Tobar then goes to get an MRI in their spine. There's no way that the radiologist looking at it can determine if that observed disc bulge that is still there. Is that a new wound that just happened and it's currently generating symptoms or is it just an abnormality that is seen from a past scar. It's scarred over no longer is that disc bulge creating pain in the true source of pain is actually at the facet joints, you can see it actually can become much more difficult to understand as someone that's looking at us.  Vine is what I'm seeing is that truly what's generating pain, even if the anatomical structure that was causing pain was identified the knowledge of that problem. It actually does very little for a clinician like a physical therapist chiropractor. Dr. It does very little for us in finding the next possible fix. This is because problems like a disc bulge could be due to a couple different causes.  For this reason it would be of no benefit of anyone just to do a simple Google search five best exercises for disc bulge. If you do that, I promise you the results that you're finding are not going to be efficient. Not every single person is going to respond to the same type of treatment based on the anatomy of what is injured in the end. The only person who actually benefits from the knowledge of what exact Anatomy is injured is the surgeon because a surgeon  To fix the problem by cutting it out or repairing it. No one else benefits from it. Okay. So here's the next thing to think about in MRI is only a picture of your anatomy in one particular posture. If you've ever had an MRI, I've had a few you're just laying in this machine same thing for the CAT scan same thing as an x-ray your in one particular posture. They take a snapshot. That's what they're looking at. It would be naive to think that a mechanic.  It could look at a picture of a race car in know exactly why it seemed to me make like a weird noise when you're shifting from third to fourth gear at 60 miles an hour. Just think about it if you took your car to a mechanic and they're like just just take a picture of the engine. I can figure it out from there be like I have no trust in this mechanic. There's no way in which I could diagnose my car troubles with just looking at a picture. However, our society is very hesitant to do the same thing with our medical doctors.  Better attempting to interpret what's going on with our spine just by taking an MRI of it that makes sense in order for a skilled mechanic for a car to truly diagnose a problem with the engine. He's got to take the car for a spent. You're going to say. Hey wait here. I'm going to go take your car for a spin on the look at some things. I'm going to rev the engine up. I'm going to test the capabilities of it. I'm going to slam on the brakes real hard. I'm going to see how things are working the mechanic must establish context for what's  eating a problem the same goes for our physical body. We need context through a full physical movement first examination in order to uncover. What is actually triggering pain what movements would loads what postures what is creating pain can just look at a picture. It is only after we go through a full movement diagnosis that we can then turn to Imaging if we want to to look deeper into what specific tissues may be driving or symptoms.  Now this is not to say that the MRI results should be completely dismissed because that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that the findings the content of an MRI should only be interpretable within the context of a full evaluation for what is actually causing our pain. So here's an example of how we could correctly view the results of an MRI. So let's go back to that prior story that we talked about your lifting all of a sudden you have pain.  Pain and blah blah blah you go on to the doctor's office get an MRI the first thing that should happen whenever you go into a practitioner is that they should do some movement testing and screening so sort of determine what is creating pain and what takes it away what feels good. So here's a simple test you can perform to understand of whether or not a disc bulge. Is it truly an active disc bulge? Is it a new wound or is it an old scar now? This is a test that I've learned from. Dr.  Or Miguel de we're now back expert I definitely recommend going back. I've had them on the podcast three times go back and listen to the stuff that we've done together in the knowledge that he shares because it's just truly amazing but one of the tests is basically just sitting in a chair and you're going to start in a neutral spine position, which means set up with good posture. You're going to take your hands on the bottom of the chair and you're going to pull up. So basically you're in a try to compress your spine straight down, but keep it in that neutral position. What?  What happens did they create pain? Yes, no, next you're going to round your back like crazy Flex it and then do the same thing. So basically you're combining flexion and compression or force and does that create back pain? So yes or no for someone that maybe has a disc bulge that's often going to create some pain. So then let's find out. Alright that creates pain what feels good now if you get up and walk around for 10 minutes,  Have less pain or you line your stomach for a few minutes in a slightly extended spinal position. What happens did the pain lesson you see when we move to understanding how the body generates pain, but then also what feels good were able to put more context to the pain that we're having. So after that I may do some other types of tests with someone that comes to me with the situation. So for example, you're having pain with lifting now,  Let's say you only have pain with a deadlift or squat but in doing so like a squat you notice that as you get all the way down to the bottom squat your spine is actually flexed a little bit. So you have a little bit of that but wink and that brings out pain, but what if all of a sudden we change your squat pattern just slightly in clinic and I say squat only to a point where your back remains a neutral so don't go all the way down. What happens. Does that decrease your back pain? Do we just change?  Or symptoms by changing your movement. So understanding that if we can limit excessive flexion of the back it does that decrease pain. We can also come to the understanding that movement of flexion under load is a current trigger for pain. So this is all giving us more context. If we wanted to add that time. We could then look to an MRI and say with more confidence that the disc bulge that popped up at that certain level is likely inactive just fault.  Judge, which of the anatomical cause of pain see when you sit down and you Flex under load with the chair stretch or when you squat all the way down to the bottom and your backgrounds uneven Force distribution at that spinal segments pressurizes the disc in a way that is forcing more to that inner nucleus to seep its way through the outer rings of the disc, which is then triggering paints Dynamic disc bulge without that context through the examination. There's no way.  Determine if that disc bulge found on MRI is the exact cause of pain. So you have to have both we cannot just look at an MRI. So where did the story for most of us who go the traditional route of seeing a doctor who doesn't even touch us just talks to us and then gets an MRI where most that turns takes a turn for the worse. Our story is that the only form of evaluation is ordering an MRI the evaluation for someone in back?  Pain is the most crucial part of fixing pain because it establishes the foundation from which the entire treatment plan is then based upon and the case for most of us. It's established on this very Rocky assumption that a picture is worth a thousand words. So I hope you guys liked today's podcast and were able to take just a little bit of a better understanding of way that the next time you go to a  Her and they asked to only do an MRI and they don't do any other types of testing understand that you're probably not at the best doctor for you. I would highly recommend going to see physical therapist chiropractor medical doctor that treats from a movement perspective who understands how to screen the body properly by not just looking in ordering some expensive Imaging now, if you would like to learn a little bit more on the way in which I recommend screening back pain,  All you have to do go online Squad University.com under the blog article tab at the top scroll on down. There's a Blog for free that says how to screen your low back pain just walk through that's a very simple process and it can give you like I said today a little bit better context for what may be triggering your pain. You don't need to have an expert clinician there to tell you what specific and natta me may be injured you have to understand a movement first perspective because here's the deal  twould guides been the next couple steps in your rehab understanding disc bulge or fassett impingement or end plate fracture itself in itself does not drive your treatment but understanding necessarily loading tolerance flexion and tolerance extension and toners that gives us just a little bit better understanding for our first steps that we need to take right after that to decrease our pain and then build resiliency with a proper training program that's individualized to your body and  Ember there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to back pain. You have to understand how you were presenting and then how we can then build back on top of that to find your best treatment plan. I hope you guys liked today's quick podcast. If you did, please hit me up at Twitter is quite University and just give me just a little bit of feedback if there's something you want to listen to in the future or any guess that you'd like to have on the show until next week guys.

You're listening to another episode of BJJ psychologist with me your host doctor. Yasi Pujols. I'm a clinical psychologist and Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. Today is Thursday, June 20th, 2019, and I have taken a brief break from podcasting because I went to Tokyo my last podcast episode was about how I was traveling to Tokyo and I'm back and what a fantastic way to celebrate episode number 50. Yes. I cannot believe it's been 50 episodes already. Thank you so much for listening to by the way. So the 50th episode. Let's talk about Tokyo. I'm sitting at the top of the Masters to Purple belt female rankings. That's is. I just I'm still in shock. I don't know. How exactly  Lee I managed to pull it off but I'm 75 points ahead of the second place person. So let's see how long I stay in the top, you know, it's all about points system. I have about three tournaments left in this season, and I don't know let's see what happens. So the over the weekend I participated are and registered for the Tokyo open which was Saturday and the international Master's Championship.  Of Asia, which was Sunday? I fought six matches. I would have had more one person dropped out because of a knee injury and another person had to leave because her flight was leaving back to Singapore. I believe or Thailand, so I ended up with six matches. I subbed for four of them to Ezekiel chokes a wrist lock and triangle. Maybe I can't remember and then the other two  To I won on points. So the first of the two was 1500 points scored on me and the second match was I won by two advantages so 0 0 and two advantages. I just knew that I had to stay close and tight and didn't give her any room to advance because she was really strong. So I played a little bit of strategy and I had to sub attempts which gave me the two advantages or maybe yeah to some.  With four and two advantages one for each and so yeah, I pulled it off. I cannot believe you know, I I've looked online and heard about and seen photos of friends and other digital people that I admire pulling off a quad gold. I did think did not think that would happen to me I went in  Just wanting to fight really really well really hard and I did that. I guess at the end of the day. I had the better Jiu-Jitsu out of everyone and I think that that's the most important point. I wanted to make for me like a lot of people like, oh you're gonna win you're gonna win and people will say or state have an affirmation. I'm gonna win gold this weekend or I'm gonna win gold at such-and-such tournament before it happens and for me, I don't know I've had a bit.  Of a hard time stating that I'm going to win something or I'm gonna gain a title. I'm going to do this or that and accomplish it before it actually happens and I think for me by saying I'm going to win before it's time to fight in that tournament. I feel like that puts pressure on myself. If I say I'm gonna win then oh my God, I have to win and then I start freaking out about I put it out there. I've told people now have to follow through.  Through and what happens if I don't follow her so I create way too much anxiety and stress by saying I'm in a win before I'm going to actually go there and win. So for me, I've had to taper off from any kind of discussion about how the how the results will come out and I just talk like whenever someone says, oh you're gonna win which is a nice compliment. Thank you. I appreciate it. But I'm not going to say those words because I  Know what it does to me. It increases the stress and pressure when there's already a bunch of stress and pressure on me because you know fighting is very hard competing is very hard. So if I can minimize an aspect of anxiety Then I'm going to do that and that's why I in my response to people who tell me that I'm going to win I say, you know, I just want a good performance. I want to stay safe healthy and have a good performance. And honestly, if you have a good performance if you have your best performance that's going to win.  The day and if I can focus on what I can control. Okay, I'm gonna have some decent Jiu-Jitsu. I'm going to put my game plan into action. I'm going to focus on closing it up any space having some good pressure getting good crops ways, you know, the little things if I focus on that leading up to the tournament, those are the things that get you the win. It's the details that you have to remember to get you that win or to get you out of it.  You know the Sea of people in your division so you can make it to the podium or whatever your goal is, you know that it's always nice to win and I think at the end of the day only one person can win and if you're in a stacked division that pressure can really really get to you. So my recommendation is evaluate how much pressure you feel when you feel like you have to say that you're going to win or you have to put in your mind that you're going to win.  In it works differently for everyone for some people they really get jazzed up or you know inspired by saying hey, I'm gonna win this and they start believing it for for me more on the anxious side. I have to regulate that. So if you're a person that when you say I'm going to win this tournament and then you feel like this rise of anxiety inside of you or feeling pressured or stressed then maybe focus on  The little things that you do control. Okay. I have a nagging injury. I'm just going to baby it take care of it leading up to the tournament. So I want my injury to feel to not impact me on that day. So I think manage it a little bit if it's something that affects you if you're a person that wants to write on your bathroom mirror. I am the such-and-such champion and it works for you by all means go ahead and do that. I wish I could be one of those.  As people that was bold enough to state I'm gonna win before I win but I am not and maybe that's maybe that's a weakness or an insecurity. Like what will people think if I if I don't win people don't care, you know, the tournament has passed and now we're all looking forward to some the next one. That's that's the other aspect of of winning and losing whatever the result is. It's already yesterday. It's  The best so yeah, some of us can celebrate a little bit and ride that ride that win a little bit longer, but the reality is it's old news. It's old news. We're all of us are already focusing on the next big thing and for me, I guess that's American Nationals if I don't have to work. So if you're in Las Vegas for American Nationals, hit me up. I still have a few donut BJJ stickers then I would love to pass out to anyone.  That guy that's interested and also catch me on Instagram. If you want to catch all of those travels man. I've been traveling a lot this season and it's been spectacular and thank you for following along and that's at Dr. Dot. Yasi underscore fit on the gram. And then on Facebook to you can also follow me there. Sometimes I post some some different. I like to post different content in different different platforms. So Facebook is good for  Everyone else that doesn't use Instagram I guess and that's it that I'm gonna call it. So I'm heading over to the Rio Grande Valley this weekend get some training in at my home school modern Jiu-Jitsu that's going to be a lot of fun. I have my donut key. So hopefully get some pictures with the girls and their donate gies. Oh, yeah, go follow Phenom. Kimonos. Go support them. They are a Dallas based company, Dallas, Texas, and they have fantastic.  Tastic, he's for women and girls they have the teeniest Q2 skis. All right until the next one. Happy 50th episode to you all listeners and thanks.

I'm Vanessa Richardson. And today we're going back to October 22nd 1966 the day that Robert Helen and joy Sims were murdered in their home in Tallahassee, Florida, their deaths known as The Sims Family murders weren't discovered until their teenage daughter.  Jeanne came home from a babysitting job. Let's go back to jeanne's gruesome homecoming late that night.  Jeannie's hometown of Tallahassee practically shut down when Florida state had a game and that night had been no different but Jeanne didn't mind she spent the evening at the neighbor's house babysitting their children by the time she got home after 11 p.m. She just wanted to crawl into bed and fall asleep. Jeannie knew something was wrong as soon as she walked in the front door her parents.  Always waited up for her when she was out after curfew her mom and Dad should have been at the kitchen table annoyed by the lateness of the hour, but they were nowhere to be seen.  Jeanne hung her coat in the closet and heard the muffled sound of the TV playing upstairs. Her parents must have climbed into bed to watch the Nightly News while they were waiting for her to get home. Maybe they weren't even mad Jeannie climbed the stairs with each step. She heard the TV getting louder. It was coming from her parents bedroom. Jeannie pushed open the door and stopped still stunned. She was paralyzed.  Unable to comprehend it her younger sister Joy lay sprawled across the floor her wrists and ankles tied together her mouth gagged. Her nightgown was scrunched up and her underwear down around her ankles and she was soaked in blood Joy was dead. Jeannie's mother and father lay on the floor beside Joy also bound there was so much blood on the floor.  Or on her family. Jeanne couldn't even be sure who was the most injured or what had happened to them. All she knew was that this was wrong all wrong. She didn't know how long she stood in the doorway stunned into immobility. Perhaps she'd have remained Frozen like that forever. If not for the strained rasping that shocked her back to reality. It was her father struggling to breathe he was  Still alive now that she knew where to look Jeanne could see the shallow rise and fall of his chest. She could still save him but she had to act fast Jeanne ran to the phone on the far side of the room. Jeannie sees the phone and dialed the emergency number. She'd memorized for her babysitting job. It felt like an eternity past before anyone answered. She blurted what information she could split between the grounded.  Reality of the phone in her hand and the hellish crime scene just a few feet away. Jeanne knew her family needed her but she dreaded returning to their sides better to stay here on the phone better to quench her Panic by focusing on one step at a time one breath at a time one sentence at a time as she explained what she'd found to the patient operator because as wild as it sounded  Any recognized that her family were victims of an attempted mass murder?  Coming up doctors scramble to save Genies parents and police search for who attacked the Sims family now back to the story on October 22nd 1966 an unknown assailant broke into the Sims Family Home the attacker bound and stabbed Robert and Helen Sims and their 12 year old daughter Joy, then left them for dead. The first person to find the crime scene was Robert and  Ellen's other daughter Jeanie, she discovered the crime scene when she came home from a babysitting job shortly after 11 p.m. By the time Jeannie found her family her sister Joy had already died. She called for an ambulance right away and the driver Russell Beavis soon arrived with his 16 year old son Rocky while Russell scrambled to revive The Sims Rocky cut their bonds and tried to comfort.  Jeannie unfortunately Genies father died shortly after Russell's arrival only her mother Helen made it to the hospital for nine days Helen lingered in a coma the police kept her under constant watch knowing that if she ever woke up. She was the only eyewitness who could identify the killer but she never regained consciousness.  The Sims Family murders shocked the people of Tallahassee the community was so Disturbed Halloween trick-or-treating was cancelled that year out of fear of further violent acts a murder investigation launched immediately, but was hindered by police mistakes, they failed to properly secure the crime scene. So various neighbors well-wishers and amateur sleuths, let themselves in and out of the Sims home hopelessly  And eating whatever evidence the killer Left Behind adding to the difficulty was the fact that the Sims were upstanding community members with no known enemies investigators questioned Helens former employer and a troubled teen neighbor, but they were never considered serious suspects with no evidence and no motives to go off of the police had no leads because Joy the youngest Sims daughter was found with her underwear.  And the police suspected she was sexually assaulted during or after the attack and because her stab wounds were more extensive than her parents the police supposed. She was the main target of the attack but this Theory didn't Point them toward any suspects authorities were so bereft of theories at one point. They assembled a list of everyone who had checked Truman capote's In Cold Blood Out of the library hoping that could Point them to a  Potential killer their most intriguing lead was a 19 and 20 year old couple who lived near the SIMS house the pair were never publicly identified, but the man was reportedly obsessed with the Sims family, especially Joy the woman had an unhealthy fixation with death and prior to the murders had been known to visit funeral homes for fun. Although the police were suspicious of the couple right off.  Off the bat. It was ultimately another dead end. They were unable to make any arrests without firmer evidence after the murder the couple moved out of Tallahassee only to return two decades later in 1987 when the pair resettled in Florida, the woman reached out to Tallahassee Police claiming that she had something to disclose but when the police called her in for questioning the woman changed her mind  And and revealed nothing with no confession and still bereft of evidence. The police were never able to name the couple as a suspect the case File went back on the Shelf over fifty years later The Sims Family murders remain unsolved.

today is December 7th 2019 on this day in 1992 a grand jury indicted Lyle and Erik Menendez for murdering their parents in Beverly Hills, California over three years earlier at first a clever Alibi kept them out of prison, but their inability to keep their  mouth shut proved to be their undoing.  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're covering the day Erik and Lyle Menendez were indicted for murdering their parents. Although they'd been arrested in March 1990. The judicial process was held up for over two years.  Years. Let's go back to December 7 1992 when a grand jury finally had enough evidence to take the next step.  Court was in session finally over two years after Erik and Lyle Menendez were arrested for murdering their parents Jose and kitty a grand jury would be deciding whether or not to indict them. The police hadn't arrested the Menendez brothers on a whim. In fact, they had one of the most valuable pieces of evidence investigators can get their hands on a taped confession 22 year old Eric.  Mendez had confessed that he and his 24 year old brother. Lyle had bought shotguns two days before they killed their parents the night of the murders. They bought tickets to the new Batman movie, but they never watched it instead. The brothers walked into Jose and kitty Menendez Beverly Hills home and brutally killed the two people who had given them life.  He described how they cleaned up the shotgun casings, but didn't worry about leaving fingerprints after all. It was their parents house. There were traces of Erik and Lyle everywhere. Once they had cleaned up. They threw the guns into a canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains and tossed their bloody clothes in a gas station dumpster, then they returned to their parents house and called the police within days. They were using their  ordered parents money to buy Rolex watches and Lease Oceanfront Condos  This confession was all the evidence the prosecutors needed to move forward with the trial. However, Erik Menendez had made the confession to his therapist. Dr. Jerome mosul, which led to some problems the brothers lawyers argued that this damning evidence shouldn't be admissible because of therapist patient confidentiality. It was a valid point in the state of California a therapist could only reveal their  With patients under specific circumstances, but the prosecutors believed that one of these circumstances was met after confessing Lyle threatened to kill. Dr. Ozil if he revealed the contents of their conversation and a life-threatening situation for the therapist was one of the rare circumstances where doctor-patient confidentiality could be abandoned as soon as oh seals life was in danger.  He was legally permitted to take the tapes of his sessions with Eric to the police or at least that's what the prosecuting attorneys were arguing. But the brothers lawyers weren't going down without a fight in order to block the tapes release. They brought the question of doctor-patient confidentiality to the California Supreme Court.  The hearing took place on June 4 1992 over a year after the Menendez brothers were arrested ultimately tapes from only two of the four tapes were ruled admissible the other two were barred because there was insufficient evidence of threats to Warrant disclosure. It was a major setback for the prosecution. One of The Bard tapes included both brothers admitting to  Murder, if the taped confession had been allowed in court the case would be a no-brainer without it Erik and Lyle could plausibly plead not guilty. However, the tapes that were allowed still contained evidence that the police could link to the murder for instance investigators had been able to use Eric's discussion about buying the guns to track the purchase to a Big Five in San Diego. It wasn't the same.  Same as a full confession, but it was enough to take in front of a grand jury on December 7th. 1992 Erik and Lyle Menendez were officially indicted on two counts of murder the trial could officially move forward, but getting a conviction would prove to be more difficult than the prosecutors anticipated.

On December seventh nineteen, ninety two twenty two year old Erik Menendez and is 24 year old brother Lyle were indicted on two counts of murder for killing their parents despite rock-solid evidence from the prosecutors the case wasn't as simple as it should have been although they were charged with the same crimes Erik and Lyle had to be tried separately. However, because many of the witnesses would be  Moved in both trials, the two juries would hear testimony at the same time the trials officially began on July 20th 1993. If Erik and Lyle were found guilty. They would be eligible for the death sentence.  The defense new denying that the brothers had killed their parents would be a Fool's errand rather than fight the facts they decided to reframe them if the lawyers successfully introduced enough doubt in the jurors Minds, it could save the brothers lives the Menendez brothers weren't to deranged siblings who killed their parents in Cold Blood. No, they were traumatized children who suffer  Years of physical and sexual abuse at their parents hands when the brothers killed Jose and kitty Menendez. They were merely fighting back according to their testimonies. They planned the killings after Eric revealed to Lyle that their father had been sexually abusing him for 12 years Lyle to had allegedly suffered their father's abuse as a child after confronting their  sure for what he did they believed they had to kill him in order to save their own lives for the argument to stick. The defense lawyers had to prove that Erik and Lyle were in imminent danger if they could convince the jurors, then the charges could be reduced to manslaughter instead of first-degree murder because there was no hard evidence to prove their case the defense turned to testimony from teachers friends.  Family and Child Abuse experts the goal was to paint Jose and kitty Menendez as violent monsters who repeatedly threatened their sons lives. However, the prosecution was ready for them under cross-examination. They were able to poke holes in Eric and Lyles stories on several occasions. The brothers got caught in lies and inconsistent stories. It was a long drawn out.  Nowt battle after a six-month trial on January 10th 1994 Eric's jury announced their verdict. They hadn't been able to come to a decision. The jury was officially deadlocked even though the evidence that Jose and kitty Menendez were abusive was flimsy at best enough doubt had entered the jurors Minds that they were unable to come to a unified decision.  The jury in Lyles trial was deadlocked as well Against All Odds, the defense's Gambit had worked for the moment.  Because the juries were deadlocked the judge presiding over the case ordered a retrial but this time Erik and Lyle would be tried together the case was Far simpler the second time around with the new judge restricting media in the courtroom. The Joint trial had much less publicity and although it took a further two years Erik and Lyle were declared guilty of murder on.  17th 1996 the entire process had taken seven years the Menendez brothers avoided the death sentence, but were still sentenced to life in prison with no real evidence to back up their claims that their parents were abusive the impression. Most people took from the case. Was that Erik and Lyle Menendez were little more than two spoiled brats who were so delusional that they thought  thought they could get away with literal murder. But even with all the money in the world the Menendez brothers were unable to escape Justice for them the days of Rolex watches and fancy cars are long gone replaced by a tiny cell and the knowledge that they will never again be free men.

I'm Ellen and I'm a former biomedical researcher turned coach who fell in love with personal growth when it empowered me to transform my health quit my PhD travel the world and start my own business, but don't get me wrong. I'm still figuring my shit out too. And I'm so pumped to share what I'm learning along the way we've got amazing interviews big stories tips tricks and no bullshit action steps that we can all learn from. So with that welcome to this episode of The Grove Drive.  Oh, hey, hey everybody and welcome back to another episode of the growth tribe podcast full transparency. I may have just had like a little Eminem 8-mile pump up for this. I am secretly kind of obsessed with Eminem. I can rap Lose Yourself. It's my party trick, but that's actually that some going to come up today in today's episode where we are going to talk about how you can get out of your damn head my friend.  Because how many of us raise your hand do it in your car. Don't worry if anybody sees you are a little bit too stuck in our heads are a little bit too much negativity and self Chrissa criticism going on up in our heads right? I'm not the only one right? I cannot be the only one. Well, ironically we're going to talk about how 8 Mile please into that because it does in so so many ways. So this is this being in your head this having, you know negative self-talk.  Talk a lot of self-criticism is going to come up for you probably at some point in your life, you know, if you've ever felt like a perfectionist if you've ever felt, you know, identified with being a pessimist or you just recognize that there's some shitty self-talk that occurs in your head happens to so many of us. It happens to so many women. I know and it happens to guys to so guys. I know you're probably feeling this as well, you know, I always like to joke and it's actually in my Instagram bio that I'm a recovered and recovering perfectionist.  - passed a pessimist people pleaser self critic and I feel you 1,000% if you're someone who has engaged in one of these behaviors, it's a very very common thing for all of us to do but why do we do it? Why where does that come from? Like, why would it ever have been something that we evolved to have a negative self-talk and a a self-criticism? Well, really it evolved from the fact that it's a defense mechanism.  Mmm, these behaviors are something that involves evolved because we're trying to protect ourselves and this is what I mean. And this is where Eminem and 8 Mile come into play. So have you ever so for those of you that have seen eight mile mile? I'm going to paint a picture for you and remind you of a scene in that movie for those of you that haven't I'm going to describe the scene to you. So at the end of 8 Mile Eminem or the character, he plays is engaging in a rap battle, right he is.  Against all of the dudes that you know, they harassed him. They made fun of him. They beat him up throughout the movie. He's going up against them in a rap battle, right and at this point in the movie like he knows exactly what these guys are going to say about him. He knows all the ways in which they're going to taunt him all the things about his life that they're going to bring up. So he decides essentially that he's going to beat him to the punch, you know, he is going to use all the shitty things that he knows. They're going to say about him and he's going to use it in  In his rap, he's going to say yeah, I'm white. Yeah, I live in a trailer park. Yeah, the, you know my girlfriend cheated on me with one of the guys in your crew. He is going to talk about all of the stuff that he knows they're going to use against him. He uses it instead as ammo against them. He takes all the wind out of their sails so that they can't use it against him. And this is where it really really ties back to that that notion.  Self-criticism in that notion of having a negative self-talk as a defense mechanism because this is exactly what we do in the movie. It's kind of painted as a sort of empowering and Victorious scene because he wins the rap battle and then Tada go Eminem, but in our lives we engage in these exact same things all the things that were afraid of people using against us will say about ourselves, you know, if we're afraid somebody's going to say we're unfocused or lazy.  We're going to beat him to the punch and say it about ourselves almost like we're armoring ourselves against external critique. Because if we say these shitty things about ourselves, then their armor from somebody else using it against us, right. It's exactly like Eminem did in that rap battle. This is literally an example I use in one of my online programs but like to tie it all, you know into a big picture. How does this show up for us? Well, I gave you some examples but we're going to reiterate them here. Okay, because I really  To paint for you a picture that sometimes the self-deprecating talk the negative self-talk doesn't have to be you know, the oh you're such an idiot or while your piece of shit. That is a negative self-talk but this is kind of a different take on negative self-talk. It can be a bit more subtle, you know, so we talked about the fact, you know, if somebody thinks we're lazy or unfocused will try to beat them to the punch and kind of, you know point out this about ourselves as well. You know, what if you're self conscious about your way.  Wait, you know that's a big thing particularly for women. Like I know how often the shows up. I've been there I've done that. I have the T-shirt. But if you're self-conscious about your weight, and maybe you're trying to start dating you are creating an online dating profile. You'll probably make some sort of difference self-deprecating crack or put something in your online profile when they ask about your body type about having more to love. Am I the only person who's done that I sure as shit hope not but I definitely you know, when I was being self-conscious about my  Eight. That was the box. I would check, you know, even though I knew that I was athletic and I knew I was muscular. I didn't feel good about my body's capability. So I wouldn't check the athletic box. I would check the Mortal of box. So, you know, the guy went on a date with didn't show up and be disappointed in you know, the my body type. You know, I'm I'm not the only girl that it has experienced that right or the only girl that's done that so that's an example of how we can cut him try to make a little  of critical comment to beat somebody else to the punch. What about feeling like your question might be stupid? Oh my God. This was like my life in graduate school. But how many of us have done this at work or how many have done this in? Oh my God, like a political conversation. If there's some sort of political topic that you're not familiar with sometimes we won't ask the question because we're afraid it's stupid or if we do ask the question will preempt it with a comment.  Like this might be stupid, but it's the same kind of thing. And really the reason why I'm talking about this here is because it is a confident undermining Behavior. This is actually the segment in in my online course in which I talk about. This is in a segment where I talk about all sorts of confidence undermining behaviors and self-critique and making, you know consistently making self-deprecating comments is one of those behaviors  another example because I want to make sure I really really try to cover my bases here so that you guys recognize when this is showing up in your life is if you're scared that everybody is going to look down on you for not being as quote unquote good as they are you might make some sort of job at yourself, you know about how out of shape you are or that you didn't practice like this used to be something that I really struggled with when I would go to play like intramural sports or I was going to go try  They knew some sort of new hobby with my friends. You know what before I got into hiking, you know, if I had actually did have an ex-boyfriend who would take me hiking and I would make a jab at the beginning of our hike being like I'm just really out of shape. So don't expect much out of me. You know, it's something that at the time seems pretty innocuous, right? All of these things seem pretty innocuous checking a box of more to love or saying this might be a stupid question, but  Or you know making a crack about the fact that I'm out of shape or I'm not very good at this they seem so innocuous in context, but the problem is they build up over time and they undermine our confidence. So really the reason why I wanted to talk about this today is a I wanted to point out that this is you know, something that we all do it's where that that self criticism comes from. It's a defense mechanism.  - mm it's a totally normal thing to engage in but it's something that we gotta stop. It's something that we've just got to get out of our head and live our lives more and stop being so concerned about, you know, imperfection judgment rejection. This is what I mean by getting out of your damn head because this self-critique which can either show up again as these innocuous comments or can show up as an even more negative.  If talk like I'm such a piece of shit. I'm so stupid. You know, we we say those things to ourselves Right Step One is catching yourself in that shitty self-talk catching yourself in those moments where you realize? Yeah, you know what I am, you know thinking that people are judging me when they may not be I have no proof that they're judging me or when you're struggling with rejection. You have no proof that people are rejecting you or when you're just struggling with imperfection.  Your shitty self-talk whether it's really really, you know bad or it's one of these innocuous comments and catching yourself in those moments and paying attention because awareness really is step one. I know clients role in their eyes right now because I say this all the time but it's so true. You have to know that you're aware of a behavior that you're engaging in before you can change it and this is one of those things you have to be aware of the way you're talking to yourself or about yourself or you can't change.  It so Step One is catching yourself. Hopefully in the moment. When you do these things, if you're catching yourself apologizing constantly, you know kind of pre-empting comments with this might be stupid. But or you're making you know little snarky comments about your abilities or how out of shape you are that you didn't practice a step one is just noticed them in general. But the goal here really is to catch yourself in the moment catch yourself making those comments in the  Because once you're able to do that, then we move into Step 2. Once you develop that awareness try to avoid those self-deprecating remarks because if you're your own worst critic self-deprecation isn't something you should be engaging in and I feel like for so many of us we are our own worst critic, right? This is so so bad for women, but guys do it too, right so often we are our own worst critic and if we are and if we're really really  struggling with confidence these snarky self-deprecating remarks are the last thing you should be engaging and they don't seem like they're particularly harmful, right but they are because they build on top of themselves over time and they undermine your confidence. So Step One is developed that awareness, you know catch yourself when you have that shitty self-talk step two is once you develop that awareness try to avoid those self-deprecating remarks.  Seriously, very very important and then step three is we've talked about the fact that this self-criticism this self-deprecation comes from a place of you know, wanting to be perfect trying to avoid judgment or to avoid rejection last week when we were at High Performance Academy Brendon burchard didn't exercise with all of us and there were like two thousand people in the room. He asked us to think off the top of our head about the rejections we've experienced in our lives that we still  Are you with us? You know not the ones that you felt rejected in the moment, but you kind of don't give a shit anymore the ones that really left a mark on you. I was able to think about three to five people three to five situations are people in this instance. And that was about the average of the two thousand people in the room, you know, some people they could only think of one some people they could think of like 10, and for those people he was just like, oh my God give them a hug, but that was about the average three to five people.  Then he asked us to think of how many people we'd ever interacted with In Our Lifetime. Was it a hundred a thousand five thousand ten thousand, you know, it's a lot more than probably the number of people who you felt rejected by I think the average in the room was again about about a thousand. So on average this group of 2,000 people had experienced three to five rejections in their life and on average they had interacted with a thousand.  People and then came his big question his big take away his big point of doing that exercise.  Why are you letting the three shitty people overshadow the 1000 good ones?  And that is something that so many of us do we're in our head because of these fears these fears of rejection these fears of not being perfect or enough or these fears of judgment. So that brings us back to rule number three, once you've developed that awareness Step 1 once Step 2 you have you know changed yourself talk and caught yourself and started to avoid those self-deprecating remarks in favor of something more positive.  Three is then to remember the three two one thousand rule. We're just going to call it that the three two one thousand rule that your fear of being rejected only happens about point three percent of the time. Yeah. I just did some math there because I'm tutoring now. So what but really that fear of being rejected only happens point three percent of the time. So are you going to let that potential .3% hold you back?  That's really the takeaway of today is to note that these seemingly innocuous things. We say aren't that innocuous. Once they start stacking on top of each other to try to catch those things in the moment develop awareness around the things that were saying and when we say them to change from those self-deprecating comments to something that's more positive more confidence building more motivating and three to always remember that three to 1000 rule that your fear of being rejected.  Only happens point three percent of the time. I hope that this really helped you guys to get out of your own damn way to get out of your own damn head because this is something that so many of us do and I hope you liked my random-ass 8-mile analogy in here because I full-on watch that before recording this podcast.

If you really need them what they're supposed to be using our what they're supposed to be doing and what the research says. So let's start with this what are banded joint mobilizations supposed to be doing. What is the goal of them? So let's first start with the to  Most common joints that we use them with the ankle now banded joint mobilizations during the ankle. The goal is to be able to help improve the way in which the bones of the ankle move over each other. Now, let's bring in the first piece of scientific research. This is an article called the efficacy of mobilization with movement for patients with limited dorsiflexion after ankle sprain a crossover trial. Yes, that is a mouthful and that is what a lot of research has very long drawn out.  Article names but let's get to the bottom of it. When you go into a deep squat a deep clean a snatch receiving position. You need a lot of ankle Mobility that is the movement of dorsiflexion, which means your knee goes over your toe for looking at the ankle that is actually a bunch of small bones deep inside your ankle moving around on each other when you look at the way in which the bones move there is a bone called your tailless in your foot.  It is supposed to Glide backwards on your tibia, which is your big shin bone when you move into dorsiflexion. So you're going down into a deep squat your knees moving over your toe if we took an x-ray and looked at your ankle joint what it's doing. Naturally that tail is bone, which is one of the top bones in. Your foot is gliding backwards toward your heel with respect to your shin bone as it goes over your toes during ankle dorsiflexion, so  The goal of a banded joint mobilization is to help improve this Glide. So it's called an accessory motion a very small joint on joint bone-on-bone Glide. Basically the goal is to use a mobilization which was first turned back into Physical Therapy world as they Mulligan's mobilization with movement or mwn. It's based on a physical therapist that came up with a number of different mobile.  Possessions basically ability to move the joints one on top of the other but the goal is to help improve the way in which that tailless bone is moving. Is it getting locked up and not gliding backwards like it should so that is what we're doing when we're doing in bandage one mobilization or the goal for it at the ankle. Now, let's go to the next most common joint which is the hip joint. Now, there's not as much research on the hip joint with  self band enjoy mobilizations or span enjoy mobilizations in general, but there is a research article that came out in the IJ spt International Journal of sports physical therapy called restricted hip mobility clinical suggestions for self mobilization and muscle re-education. Basically, they're talking about the goal what we're using mobilizations for and ideally what you would be doing them for for different purposes. Now the goal with a self mobilization technique  Is to improve capsule and potentially some of the other connective tissue Mobility that surrounds the joint so the hip joints one of the biggest and strongest joints in the entire body. It's basically a ball which is the end of your femur in socket, which is your pelvis bone your hip socket right there called your acetabulum. So the goal with that is to help improve the mobility of all the tissues that surround that ball and socket joint. That's your  Hip capsule, which is a very thick piece of multiple tissues that surround that area basically sort of hold everything together if they are presumed to be stiff in any one area. It can limit how the actual ball and socket moves. So if you have stiffness that has developed in let's say the posterior or lateral side of the hip capsule. It would then lead to the ball sitting a little awkwardly and not in the center of the  Hip socket itself. So then when you go to move because the ball is not sitting in the center of the hip socket, you're getting an off-axis movement greater inclination for things like hip impingement. Basically the balls rolling around and smashing into the front side of the hip socket because it's being pushed forward. It's not starting directly in the center. So that's one idea behind it. But the band enjoy mobilizations will talk about how you're doing them can also be thought to help improve what we would call as  Muscle re-education. We'll talk about that in a second. So basically we've talked about the ankle in the hip. Those are the two most common places where you would use a joint mobilization and that's just a self bandage joint mobilization because again, these are things that I'm trying to teach others that they can do outside of the clinic. Now, there are many other places where we use joint mobilizations as physical therapist as chiropractors. For example, the shoulder I use  Our joint mobilizations a number of time especially on those who have just had let's say a shoulder surgery and their capsule has become adaptively stiffened because they've been stuck in an arm brace for the last six weeks. So things like that can be helpful for the shoulder, but I would hesitate to ever give someone a self banded joint mobilization for the shoulder. I think that's often a bad idea. And if you see someone recommending it without first being assessed by a physical therapist or car  director, I would be very hesitant to try it yourself. So let's talk about the next step we talked about what they are and what the goal of using them for. Let's talk about what would you use each one of them for is it right for your body? So let's go back to the ankle. So we talked about that a banded joint mobilization. The goal is to help improve the posterior Glide of the talus bone. So we want to help the bones move. Well over one another so that you can improve  The flexion ankle Mobility get to a deeper squat. How do you know if you even need to use this? It's a very simple test. I'm sure many of you have seen me use it many times and showed across social media. It's called the 5 inch wall test. You're going to kneel down by wall put your foot 5 inches the big toe 5 inches from the base of the wall. Keep your heel down. Try to touch your knee to the wall without your heel popping up what happened. Could you get there or not? If you couldn't it means that you're lacking.  Ankle mobility in the amount that you need if you're trying to do any deep squatting now when you get there and you're trying it, let's say you fail the next step is to think about why did I fail do I have stiffness in the back of the calf? Because that could be something that we can work on with soft tissue mobilization like foam rolling or some stretching but some of you may have had a pinch or block sensation in the front side of your ankle that's usually significant of a joint.  You see as you try to drive your knee over your toe. You got to that point where you're tailless bone wasn't gliding backwards like it should so your tibia the big shinbone ran into it in that pinching sensation or the two joints or the joint right there the two bones coming together now, why would that occur could occur for a number of reasons you could have had a previous sprained. Ankle. In fact, there's research showing that upwards of  45% I believe of people who have had a prior sprained ankle will have future issues in joint gliding for example having this issue in joint accessory movements. So you may not even have had any current pain. But if you had a sprained ankle a while ago that may have led to you not having great joint movement in the Foot and Ankle right there which led to this pinch sensation blocked sensation.  Has limited your dorsiflexion now if you had that pinched sensation think about it like this. If you have ever driven your car through a roundabout or around around about correct. So you've gotten up to the roundabout and you're at the stop sign you obviously just can't drive straight through the roundabout. That'd be stupid. You ruin the bottom of your car. So what do you do you go around the roundabout what that's exactly what happens when you have  A joint restriction in your ankle your knee is trying to translate forward over your toe to get into a really deep squat. It wants to go straight forward but it can't because there's a big intersection roundabout that's been placed right in the middle of that lane. So in order to get a deeper squat your car which means that your knee has to spin around in order to continue going forward getting into a deeper squat your shin has to  This is the reason why a lot of times people with limited ankle Mobility will also show knee cave in the very bottom of the squat. It's because in order for their need to get further for to allow them to squat that deep their body has to make compensations. So by improving ankle mobility in cleaning up were effectively taking away that roundabout so that they need can continue straight forward but along the right path meaning the knee stays in line with the body. So if you tried that 5 inch wall test  and you had that pinch sensation the front of your ankle research has shown that banded joint mobilizations can be very helpful at improving that joint accessory Glide getting the Taylor's to move backwards on the tibia. Meaning that you will have improved dorsiflexion Mobility improved ankle mobility and that will allow you to have a better looking Squad of better receiving position for your snatch or your clean because you're taking away that joint mobilization.  Shit now will there be people that no matter how many bandage or mobilizations you do? You can just not clean that area up sure. It happens. For example. I had a patient that came to me a number of years ago and he had a number of ankle surgeries from playing football back in the day and no matter how many ban enjoy mobilizations. We did. He just could not improve his ankle Mobility. So what did we do? We said you know what I still want to work on the ankle Mobility as much as possible. You got a phone.  Well, do your stretches see what we can do to maximize the potential of ink Mobility with our different corrective exercises, but when it's time to pick up a barbell, I want you to put on weight lifting shoes with erased heel and if you need to maybe even another heel insert, there's a number of different companies that will have small little inserts that you can put in your shoe to give you even more assistance because when you pick up a barbell, I want you to maximize your current potential in that means trying to help as much.  As possible eliminate anything any weak links that are hindering your movement quality. So that is an option for some people because what I want you to do how you know, if an ankle mobilizations right for you is you test you do the ankle mobilization and you immediately retest you try that 5 inch wall test again you get in the bottom of the deep Squat and you say to yourself. Is it any better? Yes or no? Because if it is right for your body and you did enough of them you will see a dramatic.  Matic Improvement now, how many do you do what you want to do is you want to put your foot on a box a couple plates. You want to elevate it you're going to have a band on the top of your foot because that band is going to be pulling down on the tail is improving and trying to assist in that Glide because the band is pulling back and down on the top of your foot not on your shin don't have that band up too high because remember if that band is up on the bottom of your shin. What are you doing? You're trying.  Pull your tibia backwards. That's not the way your ankle naturally Glides. You want that band on the top of your foot over the top of your tailless bone. So you have the foot properly on top of a box. You have a band pulling down and back at an angle. Now, you're going to just drive your knee over your toe get into a deep lunge like you did with that 5 inch wall test and just try to push your knee over your toe. If there's enough tension on the band. You'll have taken away that limitation that pinch you should no longer feel that pinch and you're just going to  Rock back and forth here and go forward hold it for a couple seconds and back. I'd maybe do about 20 of those in a row and then retest see was it effective for your body at eliciting the change you're trying to find less pension the front of the ankle and more ankle range of motion. Okay. So that's the ankle. The next thing we're talking about is the hip how do you know if you should do ab and enjoy mobilization for your hip? Well, we want to see first off. Do you need it because of a pinch or block sensation is the rage  Joint mobility issue. Let's say you are trying to do a deep Squat and in doing so you feel a pinch or block sensation in the front side of your hip that is often significant of Fai femoral acetabular impingement. Basically, it means that your femurs running into the front side of your hip socket and creating this pinch. Now, what you can do is a simple test by yourself. If you don't have a friend lay on your back bring your knee all the way to your chest try to pull your thigh towards your chest.  Just now bring your knee across your body towards your opposite shoulder did that recreate that pinch? That's basically like doing this test. We called the 50 or test where you're doing a flexion adduction. You're pulling your thigh across your body in internal rotation. So we're bringing our knee across or foot goes outside where internally rotating that is often a provocative tests for a hip impingement. So again, we're in a test. We're then going to retest after we do our mobilization.  Join mobilizations from a lateral Pole or awesome for this because often I find that people have limitations because of of capsular restrictions in the lateral side. So you're going to get a band across your inner. Groin. You're going to wind it up get a lot of tension on it. The band's of me pulling laterally and you're going to get into a position where you're lunging but at a perpendicular position to where the band is attached now, here's what you're going to be doing. You're going to first pull.  Your knee in towards the middle of your body now because that bands there this motion would have previously may be created a little bit of a pinch because you're in a lunge position with your hurt or pinching leg forward and you're pulling your knee across your body. But because the band is they're pulling laterally we're creating a little gapping at the hip joint that motion should now be pinched free you're going to pull in but then you're also going to push your knee out next now keep your foot fully planted. Don't let your foot roll on its side.  But when you drive your knee out to the side, you're going to squeeze your lateral glutes as hard as you can. This is the muscle re-education because that band is also helping pull out to the side were assisting those lateral glutes and roll. So turning them on at the same time and we're to do that same motion, maybe 20 times or back and then you're going to again recheck going to get out of that lunch and you're going to check that same deep squat position and maybe laying your back and pull your knee in towards your body did that alleviate that pinch sensation at all?  If so, that mobilization is right for your body. So to the question are banded joint mobilizations legit. The answer is yes, they can be I've used them multiple times over my past years as a physical therapist working with patients of all levels in a number of different sport backgrounds, and they can be extremely helpful at delivering short and long-term changes in Mobility.  D 4 different joints like I just shared right there. Are they right for everyone? It depends it's a resounding. It depends because if you don't have a limited ankle Mobility because of joint restriction. Do you need to do a joint mobilization? No, it's not helpful for you. It's not right for your body. If you don't have an impingement of your hip, do you need to be doing a lateral bandage line mobilization? No, it's not going to be doing anything for you every single exercise.  Or size is a different tool in your toolbox. And you need to pick out which specific one is going to help you accomplish your goal when you approach your training day. You're going to break it down like this. What is my training goal for the day? What movements in my trying to do then? You're going to break down. What are the movement requirements? If you're trying to do a squat you need to get into a deep squat. Obviously, we need good ankle Mobility. We need good hip mobility. We need good core control. If you have a limitation in any those you then go to your toolbox and you go what do I need to improve this?  For those that have limited joint Mobility due to Joint restrictions stiff capsules things like that join mobilizations can be very helpful. So again, it always depends, but the answer is yes. They can be very legit. It's all about finding what you need and what you need may not be exactly what your friend needs.

You're listening to David's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast, but I you know, I let it go past. I like just fresh.  Each week. You'll hear from me table should not skip this shitty Spears.com and me the lady duvet the Superfund co-host confusion in the studio will be discussing everything young people should be talking about or are already talking about nothing is off limits or can be considered off topic as Spotify original podcast Milady. You've had some sus Tweets in your life. But what was last night? What were what was happening right now?  Tonight I tweeted I am with the most problematic Uber driver ever. So basically I'm late for work and I get an Uber and the guy is really comfortable with me until he asks me. Oh, why are you going and I say shoreditch and he's like, oh, there's lots of gays there. I always pick up lots of gay people from then I was like, okay and then fast forward to the fact that he goes sexuality is a choice and like gays choose to be gay and I was literally in the car like  Like no, it's not a choice. It's fucking back to him. Yeah, I talk to him I said it's absolutely not a choice and he was like, it really is a choice and then you know what example he gave for the fact that it's a choice the fact that Elton John used to be married to a woman and now is married to a man and then he went on to say what do you think when two women get married and I said, I think nothing of it and then he's like, I don't know it's a sticky situation. It's a sticky situation the whole time. I just wanted to just cancel the ride and just get a new one it was  Awful, can I tell you something though? You got way too friendly with Uber drivers. Sometimes the moms that I like here text from you or tweets from you. And like if I'm in an Uber I'm dead silent unless they initiate conversation and even then if I could tell it's going to be a problematic conversation or something. I don't talk about then. I just give one word answer so that they understand I want to talk to them because like the job is to get some from point A to point B. And as long as they do that, I'll give them five stars and the easiest way for me to like retain those five stars. It's  not say anything dumb later in the episode will be discussing with the good parts of the internet outweigh the bad and we'll be joined by special guests Maisie pieces some of these clips. I see on Twitter lately of Ariana Grande or just stressing me. Yeah, absolutely for listeners who don't know there's quite a few clips. And the thing is if it was one clip it be like, oh she's having a rough day. This tour has been going on for the past couple of months and isn't meant to end until well the Europe date.  Don't end until like November and then that's doesn't factor in Asia Australia. Maybe she'll go to South America or Africa so it could be going through until maybe summer next year even just two albums worth of content to support and it's just her crying like during so many songs and not like oh, this is a sad song like she's trying to be like, thank you next like upbeat songs and it's just really awkward cuz even outside of crying like she's tweeted and deleted numerous times tweets. Like I don't like touring or should I say?  I don't want to do a show and it will delete it so fast, but obviously she's got millions of fancy screenshot it yeah, and it's just awkward because she's made it very clear. She's posted screenshots of like her brain scans, which is that she's like extremely still traumatized and as PTSD from what happened in Manchester and in general in her life. She's been very unfortunate. Mmm. We're not experts we're not doctors psychiatrists therapists, but we can't see is a woman who very clearly is doing something. She does not want to be doing. Yeah and despite all this power.  And money and strength she's not able to say no to these people who somehow have even more than her doesn't that remind you of Brittany. Anyway, the difference with Brittany and Ariana is that I think Ariana is happy to release music and go about her day-to-day life and I know release perfumes clothing line, whatever like she's happy to do the pop star shit. Hmm. But it specifically live shows where she doesn't want to do that. I think with Brittany is more. She didn't want to do anything period it actually might be  Time for her to like take a Hiatus, you know, everyone keeps and it's this is so me. But everyone keeps taking bat saying when is she gonna like on the store? Not music, but when it's because she's talking to get music and that's what we're saying about like she's happy to do the day-to-day. Yeah, but when is she gonna like do a Twitter screenshot for iPhone notes section saying? Hey guys. Sorry, I can't do this tour anymore refunds available at your nearest like operator, whatever the people that truly truly support have will understand, you know, there will be people that kickoff but had mental state matters so so much more I can totally see  The hot and I don't want to take like bats or have us guess when it's going to end but realistically the North American leg ends in like three weeks or so, then she's on a break for a month and a bit and then she comes back to the UK which is where it starts does like five shows back to back at the O2 and then does a Manchester like pride thing. But in general I feel like when she has that month off she's gonna realize I like this is so much better than yeah. Of course. I think she'll finish this North American like and then say guys, it's going to be next year. I almost  Want it to happen, you know because I really I really think she's one of those artists that actually hasn't had a break. Would you take a Hiatus as well in her decision? Yeah, I would need a Hiatus because I would say I can't do this tour. It's going to cost you a lot more in Insurance payouts and having to pay all these tickets back then for us to just take it easy. Yeah and just like stop for a second absent. I'll do it my own pace like Lana Del Rey has said numerous times that she's not a concert performer. She doesn't like doing concerts. She doesn't  Feels confident or think she sounds as well when she does concerts, but she does like performing live on occasion, which is why very frequently you'll see she's doing this festival and that festival and only hear about her doing like the O2 more MetLife or like other Arenas across the states or Asia or whatever did I mean, that's why this summer the only chance of me. Are you seeing Lana Del Rey in the UK is when she does a music festival. Yeah. Do you think rehab might be a  A good idea. The problem is like there's so much like scrutiny on her. Anyways that when you see these like stories of like so and so is going to rehab for like exhaustion or whatever. Hmm, there should be 10 billion rumor saying she's addicted to drugs or she's pregnant or she's a drug like Jenna mean all these negative things and having to add even more stress to her. I don't think she needs rehab. I think she just needs like we said that month off is when she's gonna suddenly clock. This is what I need. And the thing is if I was her boss or manage or whatever like it's sad, but it's like what Adam Lambert?  Well young of these other people said like at the end of the day like what the music and she cares about is money. So if I was in their position I'd say, okay. Well, it's like she's going to stop working period she just doesn't want to do a tour. So let's find an alternative route if that means doing smaller intimate venues where she feels more control if it means doing pop-up shows every now and then a Festival tour like Lana Del Rey doing merchandising more focusing on that. So we have money coming in other ways. Like there's other avenues for them to feel like she's still there Cash Cow without  putting her on stage and making her cry every other night. She just needs to stop but do a Brittany and just nothing but this conversation is obviously a larger than just Ariana Grande. She's not the only performer being pushed to their limits. Yeah. Do you think I should be more stringent laws in place to maybe say this performer should have more control than a contract at a certain point. Yeah when the mental state is deteriorating and when they're crying at every performance, I think absolutely they should be stuff in place to keep the artist safe because who knows  You know, she doesn't if Ariana or any other musician who is going through a tough time doesn't get that break or doesn't get a moment stuff tends to go worse, you know, so who knows they might spiral to the point of no recovery what some of the best stuff you've seen on the internet recently. Do you know what one of my favorite things at? The minute is videos of like animals doing weird things or like, you know people's pets  It's there's this one video if this guy who's putting all his dogs in a cage but singing a song and then one I just saw that yeah, and every time another dog would run out as well. Yeah, absolutely. And then in the end of you seen the parent and the parent is bopping along. Yeah, I love I love that video. So do you think that all these funny videos on the Internet or happy tweets or motivational Instagram post outweigh the negative on those exact same platforms not outweigh. I feel like it's just about the same.  I feel like I see it having about Mount. Yeah, absolutely. Do you know the thing is it's that whole conversation about for every good deed or good action on the internet. There's another negative 1 psyches. I do think it doesn't necessarily out wipe. I do think it's about having that balance between the two. So we take you know, a more contemporary recent example, like what we've seen been happening in Sudan all this information coming out across Instagram and Twitter and YouTube is because the people there can't spread the information. Yes, we're seeing how amazing that is, but then some  Tennessee when you have you know, like there's that comedian Graham Linehan hydrophones his surname, so he wrote Father Ted The IT Crowd and a lot of other people like they aren't working with them because something is off and the minute like they don't know if mentally everything is fine now, but recently he's been like super transphobic. He's on Twitter like finding transgender people in like sending them hate or sending Tweets their employers being like you need to fire this person there a tranny bubble like horrible things. He's  Killing his own Korea, which also makes me think yeah, something is off, you know, because who would do that, you know IT Crowd father said that very successful and only to just sit in silence and enjoy your money. I know in to spell out hate like that. It's like wow you are you truly do not appreciate your career at all. So do we think that the like- horrible things he does against the transgender Community outweigh the positive amazing things all  These individuals do in regards to things like raising awareness about what's happening in Sudan or you know, what we saw with the Ohio and Alabama like abortion Bill things like that. Don't think it out ways that you know, I think the minute but the way it says pride month, there's a lot of good coming out in the world right now. Have you ever felt like, oh all I see is just bad element. I feel like a lot of people feel like that and there's a lot of like TV shows and books and things were in about how like, oh the world continues to get worse every day, but it's one of those things.  Okay, but if you're continuing to say the world is getting worse instead of putting all this energy into a ten thousand word essay for a newspaper about how the world start that same energy into making it better for every story by like global warming or a war or a natural disaster. They're simultaneously an equal amount of good stories. That could be shared. It sounds sad, but I feel like the world profess to hear about things as much as it's nice to see good things happen to good people, you know, like when you  People say like hey, I've just clear of cancer. I feel like that's nice for a hot minute and then everyone else loves drama.  Spotify original podcast, my name is Imagine. And this is my coming out story. So I was at a house party and like all people at House parties in 2015. We thought it was very cool to play Truth or Dare. So I got dared to kiss the person I was most attracted to in the circle and there was only we only had one female friend who was out at the time so I went over and I kissed her on the cheek and  Obviously very true dramatic self-aggrandizing style, but that was the first time I ever publicly admitted that I was by the song that reminds me of that time is probably talking Body by Tove Lo because I think that was a song that was playing at that house party.  Thank you so much for so many of your calling come out. We truly appreciate it. And as you start to wrap up the season it's worth mentioning that we're going to be at reading leads and latitude the summer. And if you're also attending make sure to message us because we really wanted, you know, maybe bring someone on stage or something. Yeah, absolutely come and party with us get on stage with us different do it. Whoo-hoo and now it's time for David's pops and bangers. So we've done themes quite a lot recently. So I thought you know this week. Let's just let it flow out of us, whatever songs with listening to or the songs. We're going to put out so the lady let's hear your songs.  Okay. So my first Song is You Can't Stop the Beat from Hairspray and the version that will be put on Spotify. Hopefully will be the Zac Efron film version and then you've got SNM by Rihanna song 32 by no-name Take On Me by A-ha. I love the sun. I always say like I'm sick of hearing it. But if it comes on I'm belting it out and then lastly harder better faster stronger.  By Daft Punk because it's just Timeless. Give me your five songs Mine start with funky town by lip-sync. I forgot how much of this goes Shrek everything. No, it's because I just saw my I went to a midnight screening and they started playing as I don't have to bother me, but there's a scene where they start playing Funkytown my friend throws his hands into the air and starts dancing and this was like a midnight screening so it wasn't packed but there is some people I was like so embarrassed, but the it was a nightmare from beginning to end.  As I took a photo of this and put on my story, so maybe you really see this. I put a drink in my cup holder. Yeah, and there was nothing there. There was someone unscrewed the bottom of the cup holder. So just went straight down and smashed onto the floor. They gave me a new drink but get it together. The next thing on my list is nails hair hips Heels by Todrick Hall that I have sale be there by the Spice Girls Do My Thing by stealth and gentleman a right action by Franz Ferdinand and are saw with a secret history is you know, the brother do disclosure have been  Putting out bangers for time I always feel like they're so reason I knew but 2013 is when settle came out that's been times. I I it's the best album they've ever made. Yeah, they kind of yeah. Yeah. It's the best album ever made. Well, they really discussed how they would have had their sound or the genre it stems from without gay clubs guy Lawrence half of disclosure stated the history of the music that we take influence from like house and garage obviously originated in gay clubs like the warehouse in Chicago and Paradise Garage, they then specifically mentioned both the Mary J Blige edit of  F for you and Sam Smith Latch as not being possible had it not been for the gay clubs of the past. So for the first time with the mentioning two songs, I thought Milady Our Song with the secret history. This week can be either of the two and you get to pick latch boom. So latch is Our Song with the secret history this week.  So we are joined by may see Peters. Thank you so much for coming in. Thank you for having me. What time how was your morning? It was pretty good. It's pretty good. My cat right now. He's like always been a sickly creature. Okay, like a cat flu from a young age and just sneezes like humans and all the time but that's been the average for 7 or 7 years, but now he's is quite gross but you just get accustomed to it like have a little wet wipe and I just like scrub eyeballs, but now he's started like just smelling like slightly. Terrible Gary. No, I know and I don't really like  Parents will hit the car and then I oh well guess that's it. I'm like, I know it's like you got to say like so I think I'm gonna go home and take him to the vet and have a driving lesson today as well. So it's lots of things going on in my pop star life. I love that. You've been tweeting about life pre and post love Island using your music. What was what was it? Like because it's still quite a few tweets a few days on. Yeah. It was a big deal for me. Like I'm so I want you to just lie, but that one night. I was actually out for Korean barbecue with my friend banging. It was so good.  Good and then all of a sudden I just get like all these capital letters messages and like the best bit is that will from well random people who like popped out the woodwork and obviously like closet love Island Watchers who you would never think like Mozy are sounds like that Island. My sister's like noisy. You're unloved Island. And yeah, I was just eating my food and I was like guys it's happened. So you had no awareness before them to be used not so it's really good like friends that would message you straight. Luckily. I have good.  To love. I'm watching friends. I had no idea when you wrote that obviously you didn't realize it was going to be used in TV shows or adds anything like that down the line or Tick-Tock at it for a tech talk to me. But is it weird to you know have these other people attached to their memories and their experiences when under the mindset or what you were experiencing when you wrote it was so different. Yes. I know like it's all of my favorite thing in a way.  Way when people say to you, oh this song of yours, like I listen to it every morning of the bus when I go to school and you think like actually how crazy that is that your song is part of someone's life like and you think of songs that you have that are really part of your life that you're like. Oh, yeah. That's where people are like, that's my song. Yeah, which I love when people search because I'm not no no is my as well, but I think that's like so cool. I always have that your song can and almost becomes detached from you like I did sort of love in a  Where the fact that Gemma from Bath could listen to my song every day at the gym, but that's not really where you just Amazon's every day, but she's crying you better gotta wait for the vibe and like almost like does it doesn't matter who I am if I quite like that she just takes it into a is there a musician that does the same for you? I feel like not one specific musician, but definitely there's lots of you know, when you find that one off songs, like for example, like in films or TV shows when you just hear that one song with you like I love that song.  Uh, yeah, you don't know the artist is remembered you guys ever watch Grey's Anatomy. Yeah in and out but there was this one scene where like Meredith's was like defusing a bomb and that was his song called breed husband could an Alec and I still to this day have like no idea who she is but I like really remember that song and that was the first song I ever learn guitar really randomly and still so have no idea who that woman is, but like I love that song. I always makes me think of like learning guitar for the first time and sort of really paying attention to music I guess with your other.  Exhibition more recent releases. It's been really nice to see that it has these stories and I think your fan base is so engaged in that regard like seeing them record the myself listening for the first time to a new song or like try to decode lyrics There's that nice like balance a relationship between you and them so true. It's so sick. Definitely. I think I'm so lucky because lots of people that listen to my music really care about the lyrics and the story and the song  and I feel like they all of my favorite songs. There's this real like detail in the lyrics but it's also really Universal. Do you ever singular lyric that looking at your scarf you think like if someone got a tattoo with one my lyrics this is what I will would be okay with them getting well a lot of my songs are quite so  So like so these are all food. I love it. You know, I mean, you know, what is actually a lyric that I don't talk about that much but I think is important of mine is I have a song in my head and have this lyric called says I'm still hurting and I'm still here and I remember like talk about that afterwards and someone and being like I feel like especially as women or as anyone but like just as a woman they're like, it's an especially sort of revenant emotion.  To be like sort of diminish yourself. And you know, it's fine. Like it doesn't matter like it's all good whatever, you know and really sort of not hold people accountable maybe or any of that sort of world and just sort of like back like throw it off and I love the idea of being like no I like I'm still hurting and I'm still here like and it still matters to me. And if it matters to me, then it is important and like your own feelings aren't important. Do you have any tattoos? I don't but I want to get one either. I don't have any tattoos. I don't hang up.  And I guess so as I thought I heard you guys out here. I have a twin sister. Yeah, and we want to get matching ones, but we're so different and we can't agree on what we want. So and also it's difficult. Like I'm actually not opposed to the getting of the tattoo. Once we know what we want and we decided like I'll do it tomorrow happily, I guess it so it doesn't bother me that much. I just get some more anyway, but the decision see that's where would it get me? I think the pain or whatever I would be able to cope with its the I'm  So indecisive that even then once I choose what to get it will be every single day flipping back and forth between I love it or I wish I got something else. Yeah, and that's a big decision. I can't live with. Yeah, but if it's more than maybe it's fine. You can get those like temporary tattoos. I don't mean like SpongeBob SquarePants like you like them and then stick them on but big boot they have those it's those like fake tattoos, but they last for like three months. It's like the weirdest thing I've so it's like a stick-on tattoo, but it stays for three months.  Yeah, and a friend of mine before she got her real tattoo the deal she had with her mom was that she could only get it if she did one of those long term temporary ones Genie to make sure she was fine with having it there for such a long period of time so she got on she said was there for the whole three months. So I'm kind of just got one of those like I could live with three months of a back and then even if I hate it knowing it's gone in three months, I'll be fine with that. Yeah. Did you have any like music-related weird things that like memories are like cringe attacks has led lives to call them that you think about.  Out back to school with I get cringe attacks all the time for listeners who don't know cringe attack is like when you get this brief memories God I was saying that you did that was so embarrassing and you just like shiver at the thought I can't and those memories like cover any time and you're not even thinking about so many sad one sixth grade, which is your seven. We did like a spirit we could own one day. It was a karaoke thing. So each tutor group or Homer was we called them.  To do a karaoke song off like singstar 2007 or so. Yeah and each group wants to pick whatever song they wanted and everyone would go up. But then on the actual day, I don't know if there's a rule change or something. So like one to two group for example went up but it was just the girls and they did We Are Family by Sister Sledge nice nice, but it sounds like oh, that's really I guess things are adjusting and then another group went up and it was just like three of them. I was like, oh, that's your but it was like these three really good friends. So then our group  by the I did not pick the song the song they picked was shut up by the Black Eyed Peas which opens with a lot of Fergie like high notes and extended notes and I'm not a singer. I'm basically tone deaf. Okay, I go up no one else goes up. And because it's for charity it was this thing of like you had like the money you're raising like it was like that sort of like, oh, I'll pledge x amount of money and I look at my home and no one's there now.  I'm the only one there that's turned up for this things like during our resources. I'm laughing. I'm already laughing at the like the like had boy had girl but like of the entire Middle School she was like you're nine in the whole room. It was 20 from each homeroom, except mine. Where was just in the it? Okay, cool. Okay, so then the head boy and had girl but of the entire Middle School's there and like, you know, and I think it would have been called what the girl that comes on with his majesty.  Don't have to do this. I think it's fine and like in singstar. There's like a long edit and a short edit and choose which ones you want to do. And before she let's me like answer she goes short edit and just like go and it just starts playing I made it through maybe the first 10 seconds and put the mic down and left. I just walk out of the room left. It was a rough moment. So I can't listen to that song anymore. I love Black Eyed Peas. They have some bangers, but that was too much.  Much comes on in the club and you like guys I gotta go. I don't need to leave immediately. What about you? Okay. I have a really funny story. There's actually not about me but so you guys have like funny stories and I'm literally like yeah that one time I thought I'd in class. So mine is just funny because I think about what happened to me and it made it onto a funny on my friend. She was going out with his boy. What's the Spanish Inquisition?  Yeah, because I don't know his real name. It was so our school was a boarding school, but it wasn't a private school. So we had lots of like borders from around the world and this guy was Spanish as u9. He just joined the school and him and my friend started going out in the very light, you know innocent, you know, and where the people did didn't talk a lot but he did do the thing, you know people tap you on the shoulder and then you turn around and they're like, haha. That was his main form of communication. Okay. So one of my friend at school  To Khloe we're going out for a while. And then my friend CO2 cartridge was like Maisie like this isn't the one he's not the one for me good work out with it. So she went she took him to the music room and she was like, whoo on I think I've maybe we should break up and he was like No, just like no and she's like, oh no, but I want to because I want to break up. He's like no and then another sign has become infamous my friend group because so I call it he was like, oh she's like I want to bring up is that we can't  And he's like but but the weather apparently apparently you've been meant to like take her on like a nice date or something, but he couldn't have done it because the weather so yeah, I think I remember my friend coming back to be like ya know we were still together. He didn't let me break up with him just like no. No, I have a funny story. But the problem is it's not using this person's real name, but I'm worried. They'll find out the nickname at some point. I'll say that's fine. Okay, so basically  We after my first break up with a guy when I was like 17, like I was so down for ages and then finally when my friends like I hadn't told anyone so when I told my friends that she didn't know what to say, but basically like the point I told her time likewise for listeners. So I must have told her in like February and The Break-Up happen in November. So there's only been like four ish months. I'm about to Mental Math Forest months of like not being together anymore, but I was still really sad like it was that deep and heavy  But during that time it's like trying to find like other people or whatever and one of them one time I send her a photo of by didn't give her the context. I was like, oh, what do you think of this person and she described them as spitty mouth because she just assumed that the based off how they look that. They're just spitting at all time. And so I told about the breakup and gave her the full story. She didn't notice a and she was like, so those photos that people you're setting me that you're saying what for  other reasons whatever they're actually people that you were like interested in I was like, yeah and she didn't say so she just said that like really silently and then looked it up and when I mean maybe spitting mouth isn't that spitting and that was her attempt at like cheering me up and like getting a new relationship going I mean  Did you ever find out no, no, it means pretty mouth have never mind got it. And the worst part is I don't actually know that person's real name anymore. It's just become spinning. I know it's yeah something I want to check though is you always start on YouTube and a lot of the songs are still up there. But when you look at the progression between something like electric from like 2015 to the songs you putting out now, what do you think sonically is the biggest difference I think?  If you sort of think about it and like a building block way, I think a lot of what I started with a still there. There's just been more things added but like the foundation of sort of lots of very like songwriter based songs with guitars or pianos or whatever is still there. And then I've just sort of got more tools and more friends at my disposal to sort of build up the tracks and sort of include like my other influences and other things I like because I'm not just you know, I'm like I like Joni Mitchell.  I prefer girls allowed. That's my past and what like some influence which make music so I like to think sort of incorporation of further things. But yeah, it's funny. I also think that over the last I guess how many years would it be three or four? There's been a slow but like noticeable change wife stopped like American pronunciation of certain things like can't is that one can't ya can't and I can't like definitely I've read I really don't do that in like old demos, which I was  The other day, I like used to sell these words, which is just out of like this thing to recognize American TV. Like you just obviously yeah absorb it but I do feel like that's interesting because I didn't even notice I was doing it at the time and it's interesting you mentioned in like the dichotomy of Joni Mitchell and girls loud and like how that's like two very different sounds. Is there any side of you that's tempted to be like, I'd love to just like hop onto like on a dance track as a feature one day because obviously I've a great  Voice and like you could do the lyrics for it, but the actual sound it's like it'd be strange maybe to have like on a Jax Jones style track on an album of yours, but you can still be on saying that that he puts out did I mean like that sort of dynamic? I mean, I would love to I always think like in the future that's definitely something I'd like to do like when I sort of got my own stuff like property under my belt Club Banger Club Banger. Oh, I'm so into that like a log Le banner and I feel like yeah, there are so many.  Any songs that I don't really make music, I think it was a lot like I want to do more of making music to dance to I make a lot of music to cry too, which is great and sometimes the both are like my favorite other both, but I'm definitely think about that more. But when you do more live performance you started thinking about this would be fun if I had a song in my set that people can dance to and I sort of do have that coming so it's exciting. But yeah, there's a singer called Jay Stevens who was like huge on Tumblr and then I used to like always jokingly messenger like  What is your summer Banger coming because all her music was very like Joni Mitchell singer-songwriter and she would always be like never that's not my style and then just last summer she did a featured vocalist on a track with AJ Tracy and Bauer and it's the most like heavy like base like clumsy living and I've not talked to her like a years and right after I heard it I said I was just like you could summer bangers here. Yeah.  I can't I actually can't come in today. I can't picture him in my mind right now. Yeah right now in my head, do you have any like weird celebrity crush, you know who I have a crush on and again, this isn't a new thing. Yeah, like still a fine man. Pull Rod everyone. Yeah still under my right arm.  Clueless but yes, we can go at mad. But for weird crushes, I remember one of my friends really really fancies Shaggy from Scooby-Doo the movie I forgot to say Shaggy like a rapper that would be better. But yeah Shaggy from Scooby-Doo the movie I will shower all the time like no no, yeah. Oh, okay. I will say that's what was a lot funnier when I confuse Shaggy and Scooby. Yeah.  Did anyone ever have a crush on Simba from The Lion King? I hear this all the time and I'm like what were you guys doing? Okay, just sit fighting. No IDs or so people that like animals from that like childhood era. My first-ever cartoon cross was Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid and you've never seen The Little Mermaid. I've seen a little bit too though. Weirdly. That's a big job. Yes equals only kind of girl.  No time for the beginning but now he's got to know what's going on already. Give me the got it but no Prince Eric a legend. Yeah, and allegedly awesome. Oh, yeah big big Mitch. Oh, okay. This is not the weird one. Anyone ever watched. The cartoon. Robin Hood was here Fox. Yes girl. Simba him. I was gonna say like,  Remember the snake not matter. I didn't fancy the snake but I think I had this like weird like sort of like a session. You know, when you just like something you just like looking at it. You're like wow, that's cool the snake moving on good, but I hope what I'm on Graham Norton in like three years time.  So you didn't go to university and obviously the ladies have to go into third year. I'm about to graduate. What was that experience like was a difficult choice to go to say I'm not going to go. Did you apply it all actually did it and I sort of I did my a-levels eyes as if I was going to go and I finished them and everything, but just by the time it was application time. I just sort of already doing music and one is like couldn't really be bothered. I like was like, oh, I'll probably be fine and I sort of sit down but it is weird like all of my friends and my sister obviously.  Because you need so it's strange. What would you have done if you went to UNI music? No, I never studied music at school. I was never very like good at sort of being told to do it. Hmm. So I think I would have done history or something like that did his jetavana quite like that. But yeah, I would have done some quite random and not musical see that's the thing that I always hear is that so people like Emma Watson or whatever when they go to university to pick something so far removed from their profession.  I went to University my parents were so like so I to be honest even in retrospect. I'm happy I went and I learned so much from it. And I definitely do think it's like help me find to fine-tune that wasn't an accident a lot of skills, but I specifically did a dual degree course because my parents like you need to do something super traditional like English. So the easiest way was I want you to stay in media so is doing median English and so I'm happy I did that but that's like quite a privilege stance to take especially because they were fine with English which like in itself is  Eddie a kind of creative subject Penny on what modules I guess you would choose and not everyone has that because you hear stories about people who love music or want to be actors or skateboarders or anything creative and there's like you need to go to med school or become a lawyer and all these things. We're your parents putting any pressure on you. No, I mean my parents are so sick like they're pretty chill Max. My sister's going to UNI and she's doing fashion a business and they were always just like maybe because to be fair by the time you need  Application can be around. I'd already sort of like a lot of music stuff saw it. I was already doing it like as a job and you know, I guess it's easy to be fine with something if you do have to finance it. So like my parents were like as long as you're happy and you're not draining your bank account then life is good good to go good to go and like to be fair. I was already like, you know, like supporting myself and I still live at home mostly but  just throw a but yeah, as long as like both me my sister happy then they're sure which is so lucky and privileged as you're saying because there are so many I had lots of friends whose parents weren't like that and I've got random degrees especially in music like a lot of the writers. I know have random degrees. Yeah and like it's funny like psychology is quite a common one, which I just think is funny for some ways that we everyone has degrees in Psychology. But yeah, it was a thing and with the upcoming release, this is on you. How excited are you what was like  Planning into going into that like what like do everything you can say. I'm sorry guys. I love that song. I love these overtime. So guys the best mentality fully. How did it I like I wrote it the beginning to see a really interesting actually, I wrote so that song. I have a son with a Vertex which is already out and then I have another song which title doesn't reveal yet and I wrote them all one after each other and that all the songs that coming out this year. So I wrote like three times a week and then I've written  Us on since then but those are the three that like stuck out which is interesting. Yeah, I've just always read just really loved the song like straight away. I was really attached to it. I was like, this is really good. And then yeah, it's been like a gradual process of finishing it and adding bits to it and Get It produced and yeah, and now it's so exciting is that she coming out like really quite soon. She says I need to listen to the final Master, but no, I'm so excited and I feel like I play live quite a lot and a lot of people that come to my shows.  Have been like when so song coming out you coward release it. And so yeah, I'm so excited. I feel like it's like a new bit of a new Vibe for me. And yeah really excited for it to come out exciting stuff in the Box. Well speaking of Bob's we're so excited to add your tracks to deal with Bob. Some bangers are Spotify Associated playlist. It is going to be just you and girls law probably this week bangers only and set up by the Black Eyed Peas by the bottom so you don't  Listen ya block list blacklisted. Okay. So my social media is if I remember correctly. I'm a zh4 Hannah Peters. Obviously the Hannah's not there. It's just made uh Peaches on Twitter and Instagram and maybe Peters on everything else. We have a guest before that had no idea about any of this.  Oh shit, it's funny. Yeah, and then she's like, how about the same time? It's like if you're really not that intuitive and it's like but surely is his it was his name. No, he had to be honest. I don't know. What was it official at the end. It was his name and then official. Yeah. Okay, so she's like what I get it.  Appeared in 2014, but everyone had fun Exes in their name.  The what now and it looks like I'll be like I never saw David X all like I would like for instead of an a yeah. Yeah, that's how it was. You can find me on Twitter at maybe the lady and on Instagram at sleeping with m'lady. You can find me on Twitter at written by David and on Instagram at table. Janeski, David.  He's out for a good time a Spotify original podcast.
This is soccer with coach Mark Davis.  What's going on? This is coach Mark Davis excited to be here and do this podcast. One of the things that we're going to be talking about today is college recruiting and we got a couple questions that we want to ask and kind of just go over that and these are general questions that I've gotten over, you know, the past 10 years being a college coach or college player or whatever else and hopefully it applies to your situation and you enjoy it.  So coach pleasure being with you. It's Jonathan Larson here. So as a player I want to obviously be recognized by coaches. So where do I go to be recognized for my talents just as a player. Yeah. I think the number one thing is is to be playing on a top top club team and making yourself available to the college coaches if  It's going to the college coaches ID camp or if that's going to tournaments where that college coaches being at but just being always in the conversation. So you're always pressing trying to be where the college coaches and you don't communicating with him or her and trying to be at the same tournaments that he or she is that or tempting to go to their ID camps and just you know, making sure.  Sure that college coach knows who you are as very important because a lot of times you go through the process of wanting to go play for you know college XYZ and you never make the college coach have to make a decision. So that's kind of one of my best advice might want some of my best advice is you got to make the college coach make a decision make him say yes make him say no or bye-bye them not communicating with you will be your answer as well. But to continue  You to try to communicate especially if that's a place you want to be in perfect and that kind of leads into my next question like with that like as a as a student-athlete. Would you want to put all your eggs in one basket or would you be pretty diverse and which school you were looking to go into? No, absolutely you want to be diverse. I mean you could you could decide. Hey, I really want to go to this college this University down the road Smite has always been my dream and  then you get there and it's not what you thought it was going to be. So it's it's it's very it's not in your best interest to put all your focus and just one University one college. Some of my best advices is to focus on the conferences. So hey, I like these six or seven universities. These are schools. I like and then to dive deeper and then start to look into their conference. Okay, so, you know, we're out in the west coast, so  We'll talk women's soccer for a second here and say okay. I like this school in the Mountain West. Okay, if you like that one school in the Mountain West you may like all that you might like a lot of those universities in the Mountain West. Okay. I like this school at the Big Sky. Okay. Now you look at all those schools in the Big Sky the whack the big West etc. Etc. Etc. So it really can give you I mean right there. You just kind of open yourself up to say 70 different universities, you know 1010.  Universities in each conference or in some cases even more and you know, and then we can you can start looking into each University to try to create yourself even more opportunities. Perfect. And as a as an athlete, is it okay to be really direct with the coach and be like how much money are you looking to offer me? And how much playing time am I going to get like, is that an okay thing to do? Yeah, I think yes. I think it is when it's the right situation.  Write a mean if you feel very comfortable with that coach and you feel like that coach and you are starting to get pretty close to having him or her make you an offer then I think that's time to start talking about that. I think it's the same as if you know coaches applying or if an adult is getting a job, right? Maybe not the first question you ask is. Hey, how much am I going to make I want you to pay me. It's more a could this work?  Go through the interview and then you start to dive into those types of questions. So I think it's just a little bit more about working being comfortable with the coach and recognizing the time to do it. But absolutely you need to ask those types of questions. You need to ask a lot of types of questions. Hey how many you know say you play in the Midfield and you're looking at you know, hey, I noticed on your roster that you already have seven defensive Center mints and your defensive Center mid and then it's that could throw  Red flags there that that may not be their best situation there. How hard is the coach recruiting you right? Are you coming in on as a walk-on? I mean those there's some different different types of questions and you know, every coach has got their different ways of handling things. And so like with this obviously as a student-athlete, you're not going to be as professional as you could be what are some no knows that you need to stay away from in the recruiting process. Yeah. That's a good that's a that's a really good one.  I think the number one thing is that the student athlete is doing all of the communication. So what I mean by that is not having mom or dad reach out to make any phone calls any text messages emails Etc. That's that's probably number one. And then number two is just maybe being a little bit like, I mean, you got to find that sweet spot of being aggressive.  And but also not annoying as well because I mean coaches are very very busy. And I just think it's just when things are made available for you. You just gotta jump on them. So those are the top two ones I would say is just parent, you know, if for me it's one of the biggest red flags, if a mom or dad comes up to me and I'm the initial contact is with mom or dad that is like the biggest red flag. There could be  with that. Is there any other overall advice you'd give a student-athlete?  Yeah, I mean, my number one advice would be or some of my advice would be is to just be hungry in regards to like coaches. Especially soccer coaches are generally understaffed. So if you make yourself available, if you're going to give yourself a much better opportunity to get recruited if you are aggressive.  And you are doing all the different ways because you have so many there's so many.  Different opportunities you can get right in regards to Junior College in regards to NCAA division two NCAA division one NAIA NCAA division three, you know, and if you're looking at conferences and you can start to kind of restart to research, okay, this is where I think I am and now I'm going to start focusing on that level. Okay, I like the idea of Junior College.  Because I want to play division one and you know, I haven't gotten the opportunity to go play division one. So I want to go kill it for two years and play junior college. And then by the way, I play in my next two years. I can go kill it and go get, you know, my dream School offer or very exciting offer are very attractive and CW division to offer after those two years, you know division to, you know, great education. Lots of private schools great coaches great facilities division.  You know, but it kind of understanding those different different areas. I think the the difference between the for NJCAA. So obviously it's just two years. They have the ability some institutions have the ability to offer really really big money and you can go there for two years in the facilities are somewhat decent and there's less qualifications for grades.  NCAA Division II it is very comparable to division one in regards to the the what you need a CT wise GPA wise it's very similar and the quality is very high D1. I think it's pretty self-explanatory there. It's it's the top of the top and then NCAA division three has has no scholarship. So I just think finding out what where do you fall and kind of the the  The plane pyramid and then just really researching it out. Right? I heard someone say is I feel like kids research what phone they're going to buy next more than where they want to go to their, you know, their college or university, you know, if you need to know everything about the process is okay. What what is the school cost? You know, do they offer? You know mi mi Pell Grant do I have FASFA all these different types of questions. I think are just absolutely huge for a young.  our young woman to understand and also the parents because those are the ones that a lot of times were paying for that for those institutions and you know it and I guess my last thing I would say is if a kid wants to play college soccer male or female if they work hard enough at it and they're willing to go take a risk and go live out of state There's an opportunity and there's massive opportunity in this country and it's just all about you know putting yourself in a situation to be successful  perfect thank you coach I appreciate answering those questions for me and yeah I think you very much all right thank you Jonathan
From the land of deep Darkness. I don't have to look far to find metaphors for longing during Advent.  They come as close as my living room where I sit by the window each morning in the Blurred light from our Christmas tree.  It's still pitch black at six in the morning. So the night feels impossibly long conclusive even.  The tendency of course is to flip on every light in the house to see and read better to cook breakfast by to tidy up or make lists for the day. I'm reminded of a book I read for my graduate school program titled The Embers and the stars by arizim KO hack its part philosophy part poetry and it's one of the books that has lingered with me longest since reading in it kohaku explores the value and necessity of  There's a natural logic and inherent goodness to The rhythms of day and night he claims but most of us in the modern world have insulated ourselves from them.  We live out our days and nights under fluorescent lights and in front of screens right up until we go to sleep and we wake ourselves the same way.  Our bodies have forgotten what it's like to live in darkness. And so we forgotten among other things the effect and impact of light.  This Advent. I'm struck like KO hack by nights necessity.  I'm also struck by how fitting it is that we observe Advent in the dead of winter.  In the middle of what feels like one long night punctuated by a few moments of daylight. I don't have to reach to understand verses like Isaiah 9:2 which reads the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep Darkness a light has dawned.  Most mornings in December I sit on the couch and make watching and waiting my practice. I noticed the sky lighten almost imperceptibly and then all at once into Street pinks and blues all as pale and thin as etched glass.  During Advent and especially on dark mornings. I'm primed and ready to experience light in all its potency.  This contrast reminds me that advent is for everyone. Yes, but it is not primarily for those who live in Perpetual daylight.  Advent comes first and foremost to those living in the land of deep Darkness.  The Christian story from it's very beginning is intended for those who are the most lost confused desperate. It's for those who have grown most accustomed to living in the dark in him was life. And that life was the light of all mankind the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness has not overcome it.  John 1 verses 4 and 5 during Advent, there are Myriad ways to celebrate and watch for the coming of Christ.  One good practice being present with the darkness and being willing to sit in the midst of our wounds our griefs our disappointments both Collective and personal.  At first it feels like chaos like a grave, but when light comes over the horizon stretching across the sky like a brilliant garment will see what we've longed for the night never lasts forever light is always coming always shining always and especially to the places where night is thickest.  When you're in the middle of deep Darkness, you have a front row seat to God's arrival watch and wait in the dark and you'll be the first to notice the light even now in the middle of winters black night light is traveling toward us. If you look closely there on the horizon. The sun is already shaking down the Shadows slowly filling up the sky.

If you've been following the gram, you know what this podcast is all about. If you want to participate in the show, you just got to follow me on my Ig @ naughty mommy naughty that's n 8e y to take the Pulse and stories as questions. It's all Anonymous judgment-free Zone. And this is a place where all the mommies can talk about. The nadi's things they do in aren't supposed to  Talk about so I'm kind of excited about today's episode. We're doing some things and are you recording me? Okay, I'm not by myself here. By the way, I'm definitely not she's a little shy so she's a little quiet today, but we're gonna get her in here, but I'm excited about this episode because it's that kind of out there is definitely I put this idea out there and I wasn't sure I was gonna get a response and actually got a lot of DM. So we're going to talk about that ready to go through poles. Talk about some DM's.  And kind of find what everything were roleplay is BDSM. She's freaking recording me. I can't stand her BDSM and just talk about what it you know, what it all is and kind of go into it. Now. I'm here with Miss big booty is how she wants to refer herself big booty. She has a lot of junk in the trunk.  When she's where I'm giving her some wine, I'm peer pressuring her to drink some wine so she can get ready to talk. Hi big booty Hi. How are you? I'm great. You ready to talk about roleplay and bondage? Sure. All right. So a little back story about big booty. She is a mommy as well. She does have a beautiful daughter. However, she's totally not into anything that we're talking about today.  She is I'm pretty much paying her to be here this morning. I bribed her with pizza and wine and a good time and that's pretty much why she's here and she's not into anything. So it kind of just opens it up to show you that even though most of my followers are freaks. Not everyone is a freak and some mommies are more innocent than others and that's totally cool. We're not going to peer pressure her into anything. But if she has some amazing sex tonight after this podcast, she's  She's gonna show me how she's gonna let me know so she's definitely will shout it out and let us know what's going on. So let's get right into the pool. So this episode is called what's the safe word? And which a lot of people send me their safe words and it's pretty interesting. Yeah, and we're gonna go I want to read the safe words like later in the show. Do you have a safe word? No, no.  So you just go at it. We just go on and what if it's too much do you cry not really? What if you slap was very unexpected. I got really slap really hard. So so leading up to the show tonight. Literally we learned so much about these people her and her husband. Basically, he told us that they were going at it and he  To get a little freaky a little kinky again. She's very innocent. So I guess he slapped her, but I guess he's not there to harness. She started crying.  I mean like it wasn't like that little soft tap or any it was like bitch. I'm gonna slap you and you think I must have been hard. So when I was like like shocked about it and then I'm like, holy shit. My face is red. Like no fuck off me. That is hilarious. Did you like soft spots? So if it's a soft side be okay? Yeah. I'm okay with salsa. I was like, you know, like like hmm, pull some hair and then it's fine just wasn't like a fucking big enough beautiful.  Okay. Well, I I don't want anybody knocking anybody outside definitely recommend maybe soft slapping echoing grunt see what you're comfortable with. Your partner is comfortable with and going from there. So I did do some polls on my gram. If you did follow the gram you can kind of see what those poles are about. One of them said do you role play and I got 83% said hell, yes, they will play 17% said not my thing. Do you rope like  big booty  Not really nothing else. Mr. Over here. Mr. Big booty Mister big. No, he's really doesn't do that with me. He doesn't do you like to roleplay. Would you like to replace him mind you?  What would you be would you be like the dominant person in a role play like you could be like the pet owner. He could be like the bad chihuahua ha ha. No, I mean like how he usually sometimes like want me to dress us like a sport person like a sport girl things like that like a cheerleader. Yeah, like a cheerleader or maybe like a cop and you've done that. No, I haven't but I'm like we wouldn't like keep on what am I doing?  so you definitely want to do it if the situation could not help but he usually doesn't like he's that means  sorry you into it. I know are you hoping I really wouldn't mind doing it. Oh interesting. Well, yeah, we definitely had it was pretty big of a landslide. It was 83% said yeah so that they would go ahead and or they do role play and they're into it. So then be DSN BDSM is to had 92 percent said spank me Daddy at eight percent said no. So basically everybody that follows me on Instagram are some freaks pretty much spank me Daddy. Yes.  I will beat way too much for me. Yeah. So BDSM is definitely a little bit more intense. So because of Fifty Shades of Grey. Well, let me Define it BDSM BDSM is when you're into like bondage is bondage discipline domination submission masochist. So it's definitely that's like kind of what the I guess the topic or the title of that ain't what really brought that I was like 50 Shades of Grey. So a lot of people that I saw Fifty Shades of Grey now, they're super into like tying them up dungeon and all this stuff but  But it's actually really intense BDSM like it's not like a super cute and like mr. Gray is going to come over and tickle you with a feather. It's like really intense some of this stuff is it's coming. Yeah. Have you seen it in person in person? But I mean like I have seen like in pictures.  Things like that with the girls all tied up. Yeah. No, I don't like that.  That how far do you think you would go if you could if you and your husband were at that point you were like, okay, I'm gonna do it. How far would you go? I mean from watching 50 degrees in the shade. I will like the only thing I would do is how he put her up in the little thing. I just put handcuffs. Oh like up on the bar with the head cover off and like that. It's like the most so it's funny because like I would in theory I would like to do that, but I feel like I'm just not that small for that.  It's like we went so we went to with Hustler Story by wrestling you so we did go to the Hustler Surfer anniversary my husband and I and we were just playing around and walking around trying to buy some things or whatever and we want somebody swing in theory. I want to buy something when I went to go see this week. That should have said only 200 pounds and holds.  - I mean, we're not Wales but 200 pounds want to rip the wall apart. So needs to say is Swing is not a good idea. At least if you and your husband are 200 pounds or more, I would definitely maybe not suggest the whole swing thing. So so yeah, so that's definitely the definition. So roleplay less defined role play as well roleplay is basically when you and your partner you guys kind of just role playing two different different different positions, I guess so like  Doctor nurse type of thing cop and robber cops and cowboys. I mean, I don't know. It's different role plays. I have heard of some people that are definitely into the whole like role play idea. So that's kind of cool and BDSM again was more into like bondage discipline domination, but it's definitely not as pretty and perfect as 50 Shades of Grey. So we do have some diem stories. I do have some role play stories. I so here's a  I had someone actually asked if we're like a question, I guess wait, that's me. I just need to step up my wine before we get into it. You know, we're getting her amped up by the end of the show. She's going to be like so let's talk about that bondage but story happened this one time. Alright, so roleplay so there was actually two that I actually got in but one was more like a question. She was asking you know, what I guess what is  Sexier lingerie role-playing where you're kind of just dressed up the more like the lingerie and like lacy stuff like that or roleplay like doctor nurse type of role play. I mean  turn on on a man. Like I think that they both will like it either way. I think either way pretty much in any outfit and my husband get turned on. Yeah, my husband did open up furiously. He wants me to like dress up more and do more roleplay things. I'm just never been that person. Well, the funny thing is mr. Big booty is like me beat butt-naked them anything that so that's my thing. Like I have to wear clothes all day. I rather just be naked.  So I want to just be naked. Yeah, but he's totally I don't know. My husband is totally right now. He wants to meet at like Jessup you want me to buy outfits. He's like, oh I want to try to I don't know if maybe we should try something. He doesn't care about that kind of stuff. So he's like, I really just you being naked I said and she's like just mean I could just walk around is walking around completely naked and that's why I'm a boy.  I don't know if anybody knows what that sound effect mean, usually when you boy.  See now. She's drinking more wear white. So now that was that I were talking about her husband boring and it's only been let's see how long it's been 10 minutes that we already talked about his boring. You see not too bad. Not too bad. She was a little worried. She's like 30 minutes. Can we do this? Kevin is in and we're ready at the penis. We've already reached our destination. So alright. So that was one question about the costumes and the lingerie and then I did have another one that said, let me see.  It was more about like they do more like costumes. So he actually prefers her dress up. And the thing is too is that he doesn't really take the clothes off to have sex. So she still just up the entire time which is a little weird to me. Right? I mean, I don't know. I feel like it's cute. That's I guess maybe that's why I'm not like I've never done the whole costume thing because I'm like, okay at some point going to come and rip off and I probably going to break it in the first to use anyway.  But they still have sex with the costume on is that weird to you? I mean everybody's different so, you know, they usually do like that. So it's not weird for me. Like you're not heard stories about that concept other just like keep their clothes on and they still do it and they still do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. We've definitely done with clothes on it's weird like zipper down. Come on. Don't tell me you've never done it like that. I mean, I was always naked like he can be close, but I  Walking around. So have you guys ever see her at Publix or anything? She's a woman that's walking around naked because she just wants to be naked opposite of that. She's a woman in the wine aisle. I gotta make walking around naked. So yeah, so let's go into the bondage because I got a crazy interesting DM about bondage and I think this one you might want to take another sip of wine because it's pretty intense. Actually. It's really intense.  So someone wrote me back I had put you know, what do you like role play dress-up fetish clubs, you know, what are you into and he wrote back roleplay BDSM the occasional feeding. Do you know what that is? That's been like the girl or the guy would feed the other one, like literally like feed them like food, like just feed them in watch him eat and stuff like that and wax play which is like candle wax you ever done that? Oh my God. She's like I'm corrupting her mind.  She's gonna be like send me a screenshot of this. I want to try all not really see that everybody's not every mommy is into it. And it's okay, but she still comes out the show and she's a good sport like I would do what cream I guess we could put that defeating wrote play. So I guess stuff with tying ropes.  So, okay not real playful one time. I did let him put handcuffs on me and it was so weird. I thought honestly I was like, I just felt really restraint. I didn't like it. I don't want to be arrested arrested until you with the Rope. No, I wouldn't are you just scared of the whole slapping incident like a magic those are open long time?  Scarred me. So that's the only reason why you won't do bondage stuff because you slept the fucking idiot dangerous. Apparently, we're gonna have to talk to her about them. She doesn't slap you around slave play. So slave play is like literally, I guess one person being someone else's slave know like sit down and like you said on the floor like, I don't know. Yeah, there's one is being the other person's like like Master a type thing like weird.  A great such a turn-off really you don't like that at all. So I kind of like being submissive not in life in life. I'm a very strong person but insects I like being submissive, you know, like being submissive now are you dominant? I'm very, you know, really even in the bedroom. I mean like I don't feel like like, both of us shouldn't be like that like, you know with the control, you know telling us what to do or not. No, I don't like that. I feel like we should just like, you know,  I'm more emotional Aloha listen to Drake and slow motion music stop. He wants to like candles. Oh God. I'm on your the wrong episode.  This is why she's so nervous to do this. It's she wanted us to talk about candles slow-motion missionary style. Nice romantic stuff. Oh my God.  Ever be into that kind of thing, but it definitely not for everybody. No, it's not for everybody. It's not at all. And you know, I have like I don't think everybody is different. Everybody has different opinions. Everybody likes what they like, you know, and it's fine with me but in person and my situation, I don't like that kind of stuff. So you like more Bromance. Yes, it definitely more of a girl means I'm more softie so I'm kind of like, okay, I like romance something wrong every now and then because there's sometimes he needs to crank up the romance or  every now and then I like the romance but there's sometimes you got to just pound it in Oh, look The guys are walking by and say hi guys. What's up? So, oh my God that you know was last week Matthew. Well, there it is.  McConaughey, obviously he's been talking about is like wow, it's too late. We've gone down that path so she's dying right now. Yeah, so I definitely want ruins because there's sometimes I'm like, you know, it's been so long. I want romance. I want the lights of candles the whole thing, whatever but I don't know. It's something about because like I guess in life, you know, my husband's a little more romantic and life. So I'm like, I'm okay with like behind closed doors. He's more like, uh,  Aggressive in rough. It's not more like submissive I guess behind I would hope to avoid some this apparent closed doors. But yeah, so then let's see. So I asked him interesting. Do you do this or or do you let it be done to you? And he says I'm full Dom which means he's he's basically the dominant he's recently the one that takes control so he's like so I don't really like them to have control of the situation. The only time they are in charge is is what I'm in the mood to be smacked around.  Or if this one girl in specific gets really oh this one girl specifically gets really hot when I eat a lot because she likes bigger guys, then I go in to say so how many girls you do this with and his response. I mean, it's here's the thing. He's it's pretty interesting because you wouldn't think by looking at this person through his grandma, whatever you wouldn't think he'd be into this kind of stuff, but he is definitely  We into this kind of stuff and it's really cool because a lot of times to this is so this is a male's perspective and a lot of times I do get a lot of responses from females. I really don't get that many responses from males and you know, there's not ready that you know their guy again, there are guys that just always try to slip into the DM with something crazy, but guys had actually on the topic. I really don't get a lot of guys that are on this topic but he yet so he's into it. So are you ready? This is what his answer was so I asked them. How many girls have you?  And this way and his answer was in the past three years has been five girls four of them were into the BDSM two of them loved the collars and be mistreated. So like being on a leash I want to say it was once every month or so where I would be the masochist and I actually was supposed to meet up at the feeder today, but she got called into work nurse life. There's a nurse out there that is it to this. There's a lot  of  You know doctors lawyers and you know things that people like that art into that they just answer that kind of stuff like that Ashley, you know, she used to work in a place that does that kind of stuff. Okay, and she was like there was a lot of doctors lawyers. A lot of rich people to that is into that kind of thing. She used to work at a police. What is this place? So she was actually I think I like front desk check in when they come.  Into them a place like a fetish club. Yeah, pretty much it sounds actually do that kind of so, they tie them off. They look they whipped them to do all this stuff and then they were actually wear the leather stuff. She actually wear a costume doing that to she said but she didn't do nothing like that kind of crazy, but she was like, you know putting the coats away. Yeah. She was in like the front. Yeah because you come in fully clothed in take off whatever he wants just, you know, put the outfit that's it. But I like, you know, the indoor language.  She goes as she sees all that kind of stuff too. And she's like she couldn't believe how crazy like, you know and shock got a it's pretty shocking that kind of stuff like, you know, and I'm not it could be teachers and everything like all these people are allowed to have a sex life and you know, they're all allowed as long as it's in, you know within the Realms of being legal and whatever like they're all allowed to have sex life. So yeah, like you would be surprised on how many like doctors like you said Your son's pediatrician and her daughter's pediatrician and like their teacher whatever.  This is crazy guys are running into one of them there. Oh my God, my son's like third grade teachers other random. It doesn't run into them know they're going to drown me like you shouldn't be in my daughter's now, I guess I guess I crosses the line of inquiry a little dude way across the line. It's crazy. But ya know like I am so don't judge is for me and my husband we did go to a fetish club ones. So my husband died. We went to a fetish club and it was crazy like that. Like everybody was just a  Leather, you know, we didn't really know suspect so we really didn't dress up like that. Like we just Supply kit going to a club or whatever but we went in and there was like one guy that was tied up by his arms and his legs and kind of like on a wheel thing it was so weird. So they didn't spit up all the way around where he's like upside down but I did like it was like a wheel and you can move from around and people would walk by and whipping them or whatever. I swear. It's the craziest thing so it wasn't really like why are these sweet is he like you?  Having sex or anything wasn't like that because that's more like a swingers club. So I wasn't like that but it was more like yeah, if you were getting whipped and like having fetishes, yeah, like like people like walking on leashes like on their hands and feet walking like a like a puppy and somebody else and it was it was a little shocking because I wasn't sure what to expect. Yeah, and we had been to a swingers club before but I've never been to this so I wasn't really sure what to expect. But yeah, I mean, it's a little shocking because that it's a lie. I mean you see it on TV  You're like whatever but it's a lot to see like I'm person in person. Yeah is a lot to see like in your face. So it was a little shocking but we were all so young. I think now at this age, I'm not really shocked with the things I see anymore. I don't think I think then we were younger. So it was like, oh my God people are doing this. That's the other thing too. I noticed that people older are kind of more like not okay with it, but more like I guess trying different things but I don't know because this person I wrote me in. So again, he's a guy and he's 23 and he says,  At their ages range from 19 to 26. That's really young that is really that's really into me trying like certain things or whatever. That's really young. Like, I don't think I tried things until way late. Like I was young but I was like in my later 20s and stuff not really like that young. But again, I mean teachers own everybody liked rice things whatever they want. I'm not judging. I'm just saying that that that is it's different. Like how now is like their younger? I guess. I don't know that's it's really people. You don't like we said it's people you really  Even expect so yeah, so he basically so out of all the things what do you find is the most like, oh my God, like the feeding the wax play the role play. Yeah, there's people that are into that that just want to see I guess like what is that the they feed them like baby food. You're scary movie like one of the deadly sins.  AIDS or something like he's say they just they just I guess they watch out where they either feed them and watch it and it turns them on. I mean, I don't know. Have you Peter turns me on so maybe maybe that's what happens if I don't know but yeah, I think it's out of it's definitely different and their young I like it's weird because I was like, oh, yeah, I think it's the older crowd but no they're young man, and they're doing this.  If I was if you were in nineteen, do you think you could be able to handle something like that? You don't handle it now now girls like I'm on the wrong show. I woke up. It was like I did not want to do this show Joey show get into it by the time we finished so 15. So movies like 50 Shades of Grey didn't turn you on. I mean, the only thing that turns me on from that movie was how he  Like, you know, mmm like me only that little strong scent like yeah, he picked her up and like, you know that little Pat he had some passion in it, too. Yeah. Yeah, so freaky the whole time, you know, it was some passion into that sex that they were doing and yeah, that's what turned me on that's true. Not the fact I like how he just like whacker with about or like, you know, put her up in the chain. I know it's the way  Way that he like, you know put into it that feeling they used to like the intimacy. I she's such a romantic. She's like I like the other girls are like fucking masturbating in the bathroom and she's like, I love it. But yeah, I guess yeah, I mean, he definitely has his experiences and what he does and he oh, he likes to be the strong one. He likes to be in control.  That's probably what turns them on to is to be control and that's that's the big thing too. I think a lot of it to do with the whole bondage BDSM in general even roleplay. There's always one person that is in control and the other person that's more submissive and sometimes it could be back like I think again I think in life, I'm more in control, but I think when it comes to that because I'm so in controlling life. I just want you to like just do it to it just like doing three so like and for a guy I think admittedly me they feel  good and when they're like in control because especially now girls are very like powerful powerful girls are very powerful in general. We come up to a place in our lives where we don't need men anymore. It's just there's a lot of girls to just have sex and that's it. They don't have boyfriends. I don't want any of that. They just want to just have sex and to Bingo and that's it. She's all excited. She's like the little that's my next life, but there are guys girls that are that are very  Strong and independent and everything like that. So when I think in the bedroom and a guy could be strong. It's like a turn-on. So this guy totally gets turned on and more power to you. I'm glad you like to be fed and wax played. I don't know if all that happens at the same time. I would definitely take a shower afterwards if you're like fat or wax place and everything but good for you. I think that's really cool. You tap into your that life early. You kind of get it out of your system and then zones. Yeah, and who knows maybe when he gets married because he already has it out.  Her sister some system. Yeah, and then he'll be like the innocent missionary style that you do. He just he just like yeah that's romantic candle lighting and shit. So you took all the wild craziness out and then put back my when he gets married just gonna listen and what if one of those candles decided to drop some wax on here, but it turns him off a little bit then so Beauty go  I appreciate him because I'm a freak just like him. I like all of that. I want I don't I don't think I've done the wax. I've tried to think we G mirror has heard of some crazy things. I don't know if we got no eggs. I don't think that having done the feeding thing. That's something that's different. I haven't heard that for many people. So that's very different. That's like there's definitely different. I don't think we've done the wax we've done like tying up and stuff like that. I told you he put me here and cups once yeah, I felt like I was in jail. I did they do like they really but I like  No, I like tying up. He's tied me with his ties before Oh man, he's never done that before with the tithe. I would use would you try that now? Really? Yeah that throws me off. I really thought you would know I wouldn't do that. Yeah, he signed me up with his ties before that's kind of hot. Can you hear the wind poori in the thing?  Like a moment of silence. Wait what? Yeah. Give me a second. Hold on.  I'm getting her wind up. He was like and I want any wine and now look we're almost done here. I'll wind up you I know alright, so let's see what else we're going to talk about. So let's talk about some different things you've heard of so we have this swings. Like I said the ones I saw said 200 pounds or less. So that doesn't seem like an option unless each of them are a hundred. I like how does that whole 200 pounds like a normal average male? I feel like it's at least 150 once.  So I'm saying like that girl got 50 pounds and then there's something wrong so they didn't set that up. Karelis is only the one person. I don't know. I feel like it'll be so much pressure the one person because it carries that person but think about your together. So it's still holding onto the week because you're like holding onto it. So, I mean it's cute in theory but swings can be dangerous. I guess. How about buying the mask would you do like a mask?  Like what kind of moms like you just wear like a masquerade type of mask? I mean, that's fine. Nothing that like what my husband has nothing after we bury wanted he does. He has a he has a natural Libre mask type of thing. Like it's that shape and he definitely put it on her face. We might have pictures of later if you really want to see that you might have pictures of the Nacho Libre, but I want  Do the whole podcast with this? No, but she wouldn't even wear that type of mask. I'm actually I'll break her out. I think tonight. You should make it a goal for yourself tonight. I would let him put the Nacho Libre mask. Let me just grab some nachos and call me back.  You see like how it look how she went from innocent all of a sudden. She's wearing masks and shit legit. Whatever mess we can get Nacho Libre if that's what it is. I really has to be done.  It has to be done. How about getting I'm like a little Whip or feather or something. So do you do that now? They're boring. Yeah, really? So we went to them turn me on we went to the fetish club and there was like a 90 year old guy. That was that's where he was doing the whips and the feathers that II begged my husband. I was like, come on, please. Let me go with my 9 year olds guy. Yeah. Good night guys soon.  So I was like, please and he was like yeah with her because I mean what's going to happen? I mean the great great grandpa. Is it gonna turn me on so so I bent over this little like it's almost like a massage like a table. It was like that and so I bent over whatever and he's like with your feet. Thank you me 90. That's a lot of foreplay girl and he has some sake bombs. I don't know what he was wearing. But speaking of there was a lot of guys they're just wearing like  Like harnesses just like you can't have your penis out. Like it can't be like that only. I mean unless there's rooms have sex. I don't know we didn't get that far. We got to the 90 year old man. A man would be me and that was pretty much Our Lives I got there and that was our life then to Riyadh if that makes it the story any better, but so you wouldn't do a whip or anything not how about a belt Oh, no, you're scared of getting hit cause he's gonna go in that slop.  Well, she's gonna have like welts on her ass.  She's I don't know if I'm scaring her or she's gonna have kinky sex. I can't really figure it out. She says you won't roleplay. She won't she says you won't. Yeah, she wants to play doctor and nurse she wants you to get the natural Libre mask. So look, here's where it okay. That's your homework for today. Okay, he's gonna put on the Nacho Libre mask again. Yes your body for it.  I can't stand you. He's gonna put on the mask. You guys are gonna get it on and then you get to let me know how it is if we weren't in the picture of that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it depends on how intense the pictures. I don't know if I want full on that is hilarious. Is there anything else you want to say about role-playing bondage? He's scared to death at this point. She cannot wait for this to be over. She's like this is it well, so  even though on my pole it does say a lot of people are into role-playing he came out with a natural Libre mask. I can't I can't stand you. She says he's not into it.  She's totally saying she's not into you have to see her. She's so turned on right now.  I guess what I did there to say even though a lot of people are Instagram or freaks about this and they love this topic of roleplay BDSM and I'm all for it. I love the stories. We got in the DM's about the feeding in the wax plate. That was a great story. I super appreciate it. I'm totally into it. But I everybody is like Miss big booty here. She's not into it. She could not wait to go to her room and have missionary sex and it's okay to have vanilla sex.  School, that's what you like. She likes to be romantic. She wants the candles. She was the passion you do like the passion. So do we see a Nacho Libre mask in your future or  I mean if he goes to every right now it is still out. I'm leaving right now and you're gonna text me and a half hour and let me know what happens. Okay?  But but yeah, so we're going to stay with that and there might be some videos of what Just Happening Here on my Instagram will try to get that up for you. But even though not everybody is into it. There are a lot of people that in that are into it explore have fun with it. See what your lines are your boundaries what your limits are. Sometimes people want to just a little soft slab. Sometimes people want to get smacked across the face. I mean, you know, my husband's has spec me a little hard. I would say across the face Maybe.  Like I'm here you go bitch smacking your face. Then you be like, whoa. Okay. Hopefully that doesn't happen either. But I mean, I guess you should play with it kind of see what your boundaries are what you like and what you don't like again miss big booty doesn't want anything to do with any of this. This is mortifying her and she does not even want to be on the show, but we appreciate her being on today and we appreciate  she ate her talking about I don't know everything and being red in the face the whole time. So we do appreciate that but there are some people that are into this and it's a lifestyle there are fetish clubs out.

Welcome to First and 15 the show that takes you around the UK flag football team sponsored by new Oleg your customized sportswear supplier. It's nearly game day. So let's check around the league and see what's going on.  So it's swc Premiership today and we're talking with Jeff Bond of the LSB. Spell Spartans last season Cardiff with a decent record of 13 and 2 and the Titans seven and eight you guys seven and eight not as Phantoms 4 and 9 and then the Birmingham lines three and eleven the Coventry cougars 1 and 12 both relegated. How did the season go for you guys and everyone else season for us. We started on the back foot. So we actually climbed up the  Was the season went on we opened up with one and two losing against Cardiff and Phantoms first two games and then beat the Birmingham Lions to get that one and two for the first and then yeah as the season went on especially the back end of the season. I think we only lost one. Maybe two games two games during the back end of the season. So yeah. Yeah season or two halfs has such some tough close losses and finishing with the same score results.  Alt as as the Titans we lost out on that for the playoffs because of losing one divisional game less or one divisional game more lost than the Titans had. Yeah, there's good season and Premiership did exactly as advertised. It just created really high caliber level games every every single game day. So it was good. It was good. Yeah. It was the same to see the lions in the Cougars dropping out the the Birmingham Lions have had folded some great results.  I've had in the past and and great players spawns have been very lucky and we've attained porzingis one of the top defensive players. So he's actually playing for us this year. He's also a midi be set up as well. So gives him a home luckily his parents live just down the road from from where we train so keeps him in the loop and keeps us fresh. That's all good. And then the cougar guys and girls as well. I mean, but the other cougars are really good team.  Really talented players such as shame see them go down, but I've no doubt. They'll be back up got to me a few of them but more detail than than I have in the past that the swc dragons. So it's good to train with them and see them. Yeah, like I said, they're talented they'll be fine and they'll find their way back up to the Premiership. Very soon looking at next season the flag football World guys have been out and they predicted kind of hurricanes to go 12 and 2 and top the group and you in second nine and five.  If you see that happen, I'll see what I can do to make sure that that doesn't happen. But yeah predictions are someone's thoughts. Probably not bad set of predictions probably a clever certain predictions. But yeah, we're going out there to try and win so hurricanes are a top class team. They will be extremely hard to beat but that's what it's about. It's yea Korean those platforms. They've actually put the newly promoted Bedford Blackhawks or 1 and 14.  God this season do you think it's obviously you guys are just being frozen as well. Do you think there's at that much of a jump between Division 1 and the Premiership? I don't think that's a fair reflection to the talent of that team played them few years back couple of seasons ago, but they've grown a lot more as a team. So we haven't really played them in the last 18 to 24 months. Probably probably too close to 24 months to be fair. But but but seeing them, you know from the sidelines at different tournaments everything else. I mean again, if they're in the Premiership they're there.  There for a reason so I think it's a bit of a harsh prediction. I think they'll be a much tougher team to beat than that record says on paper but most of the predictions often come off of what you've proved in the past. I think that's how most predictions are so they're more the result of people's Legacy or results previous. So we'll see but I think they're better than that, but I don't have no idea will find out the end of the season but I think I would say  Yeah, treat them with more respect than thinking. They'll be a yeah one win team and I'll see the eswc Premiership has lost a team with the merthyr. Tydfil Trojans. You see them coming back. Yeah don't know in detail. But sadly they have folded for this season. I believe a few players have moved across to the great Gators. So I don't know what the situation is with the exact team. But for this season that I mean they fold  So I believe that cause rather get relegation or something. I don't know exactly the details but no I don't at this moment. I don't see that happening. I don't see them returning we do this like of predictions.  I'm going to ask you to predict two games now. Okay, that's one Bedford Blackhawks against the Cardiff hurricanes. Obviously, it's going to be a if predicted right of first verse last place game. Yeah strongest predicted team in the swc against the guys. They don't think that will pop up. Yeah, I mean kind of hurricanes you asked me to predict I'd say they'd win that that's that's the team to beat their proven quality and they are just  For with with great players. Like I say Blackhawks will bring a big game to them. But yeah, if you're asking me to predict that's Hurricanes game and then use of won the Battle of Northampton. It's Titans vs Phantoms. How do you see this one going? Wow again, two great teams.  Yes of the Titans are very different roster than last year in so far as you know, there's lots of new guys in there couple of their big names of moved across to the Gunslingers this year. But again, from what I've seen of them a lot of young really talented guys on there. They've got about eight tables Brothers on their well, there's at least three on there. So yeah, they're going to be a very strong team to contend with this year Phantoms.  Again, highly rate them. They got an awesome wide receiver Stewart. Terry rate the quarterback. He's awesome. Right the whole team the they just the very clever well drill team. So I'll be a good game. You're asking me to predict it. I'm gonna go lightly Against the Grain and say the Titans. So I think because the Phantom's have been predicted to be above the Titans. I would say the Titans are going to win that but I think that will be a very very close game.  Or tight game but bukenya will see but that's yeah, that'd be my prediction. I mean flag football World of said that Titans will go five and nine the Phantom's of go 3 and 11. Okay. Yeah. So then yeah, I agree with that. That's probably of past pedigree or yeah, that's yeah, I feel a bit harsh towards the Phantom's because I could say a rate them and they ultimately the guys are kept us out of the playoffs last year. So we'll see but  Yep asked me to predict. Yeah, I'm excited. All right, Jeff. I look forward to speaking to after week one's finished. Thanks very much with the others predictions worked out.  Hi, my name is Dale Davis and welcome to the preview of the bat by national flight leaves Southwest Conference. Ligue 1 8 does not just roll over time. We will start this preview by taking a quick look at how the competing teams finished last year the new additions to the SW C 1A. And which teams to watch out for this year plus with a quick look at some tasty game day one match up to you.  All the teams in the League this year is notably absent. He's being terrible Trojans who promoted and the kind of Valley Celts who were undergoing a restructuring overhaul. The remaining teams are the exit the Falcons play with Wolverines formally Buccaneers of the Hammerhead who all competed in the League last year with some mixed results with only one win last year. And also the number of game day for pitch which did not help them finished one and nine on the season the - I didn't 43 points different surely started last season.  Going over the fancy Lex the Falcons, but only managed another win the rest of the way against our strongest wind that ending up to and ate with a minus 190 points different Plymouth and they go on a name change for this season becoming the Wolverines went for five and one on the with the + 73 price different actually drop the opening game of the campaign. But only lost another to the rest of the season forced in the 73 record with a class Five Points difference. Now we missing out in the promotion playoffs the new teams in the FWC 180 this year the Western super, isn't it?  When gate is both teams have played plenty of friendlies leading up to the season and of course to some good results along the way as for predictions for the season. The Falcons have to be seen as the favorite for the league giving their experience. They performance last season and they have some strength in depth to if a team can finish above the Falcons is a fair battle won. The league. The Wolverines can be a strange team in the nicest possible sense. They can post them impressive play and then drop the entities that they should be beating another experience team. They were hope to be challenging with the top of the  People should install have to be aiming for more than one win this season and 0 4 bits. It may sound harsh but an improvement on last you should be seen as a positive and they some talent and that's what Shawn V7 then should be aiming to improve on last season's debut. I consistent Squad is always the biggest battle is Swansea, but Winston recruitment no more status. Well, they'll be hoping to make a dent on the League this coming season. The rest of the soup isn't guaranteed is both only formed in June and may have 18 respectively and once the gate is performed well in the southwest series  Until the season starts. It's a bit of an unknown what to expect from both of them. Although I'm sure both squads will be able to record some feathers and have the more established teams only game they won which is at accident the choice match up to the day. They have to be I think the Battle of Devon which is the X the Falcons facing off against the Plymouth Wolverines last season's wooden spoon by our Swindon storm face towards the Hammerhead the newbies face off in league players to take on the west and super and lastly Welsh pride is at stake.  As the star of the Hammerhead basic White gate that is that's it for the preview is the SW c18. I hope you enjoy and we look forward to seeing you in the rest of the season. Welcome to the first and 15 podcast. This is your Southeast be buffer division addition of Jordan me lay and I'll be  Running you through the week one preview. And I'd also like to put together a little little power rankings of the division heading into week one. So the teams in the Southeast be then so we've got the latent steam newly-formed rookie team who are making making some waves.  We've got the London flash. You are a product of the London smoke who obviously as everyone knows are the dominant team from last year and also, you know  Bad for preseason tournament winners amongst other accolades they are not to be messed with so, you know the London flash are you know, then there's going to be some Talent on that team. We haven't heard too much about them in the preseason apart from the battle preseason tournament. We've got the werewolves sort of Veteran team.  From from where obviously we've got the London lucky ours who had an unfortunate rookie campaign last year. We're only able to pick up one win. They'll be hoping to bounce back this season and we've got that Outlaw flag Gunslingers who are very long name. They've been made to put together. So there the South Midlands  Outlaw flat Gunslingers and that's right. You heard south Midlands South Midlands why the playing in the London division? Well, your guess is as good as mine. So moving on then to the week 1 slate and to be honest with you. There's no I don't think there's going to be many surprises. We've got some some games that I think you know anyone who doesn't even  Remotely know too much detail about the flag World Kimkim probably muster up. The the main game for me that sort of game of the week is it's got to be the London Flash versus late and Steve. It's an early Battle of two teams who will be challenging for the for the division title. I think late and steam coming into this one.  For good pre-season, they're a physical team and they you know, they let you know it with some with some really really good athletes on both sides of the ball.  They will be a tough matchup for London flash. But like I said London flash have got you know, the backing of London smoke. So some of the Fringe players for the smoke may be represented for the flash. They had a good preseason tournament up in Northampton gained a victory over warrant and Revolution, which is you know, which is massive for them going into the season and  I think you know they this is going to be probably the only decent matchup of the week apologies to the other teas with this will be this will be the one that sets the tone for the rest of the season Elsewhere on the on the Slate we've got we're quite aware of got light and steam and the outlaw flag Gunslingers. So that is  That's that's going to be a tough slider games for them. Certainly. They play the Gunslingers earlier in the preseason and took a hefty defeat. So, you know, they'll hopefully pick up some things to work on to try and to try and reduce that deficit and try and get a win themselves the London flash also play the London lucky ours and they so that's  Two games for the week late and steam have got the joy of playing three games back to back which is which is a difficult task for anyone especially to start the season but they play the lucky ours where and learn them flash. So, you know, they they should have to you those fairly easy routes in the in the first and last games with the difficult game in the middle and then the outlaw flag Gunslingers obviously play whereas previously mentioned  And the lucky ours, so they'll be hoping to take away two victories, but nothing's guaranteed until you step on the field. And you know, I think I think it's gonna be a good week. Where a hosting so, you know some short travel for some people.  So yeah, it's going to be it's going to be an exciting week one. I think in terms of Power Rankings heading into Week 1 I think we go. We've got to go late and steam to start with and they had a fantastic preseason semi-final appearance in the Buzzard Bowl very, well hosted tournament by themselves and you know, they picked up some some really, you know, really good victories in  So it might not be and I was Bri Premiership side and eventually losing a close one to them in, you know difficult conditions and you know it you know who's to say that they would have picked up another Victory on Aylesbury had the conditions with that so, you know there and they also just played GB women's team and picked up two victories there. So they're going into the season with a lot of confidence and to be honest we are  I don't blame them. They you know, they can easily take charge of this division on opening week with three victories. And I think they've got three victories in them to be honest second on the power rankings, then it's got to be London Flash.  So when a nearly 500 records in the preseason tournament, like I said picks up a victory against Warrenton and they also had some clothes matchups with some of the other side's in their in their group in that tournament. I think the talent on this on their squad is going to be is high as we always see from London teams. They managed to recruit like like no other team  Is that God said the outlaw flat Gunslingers? They've had a mixed mixed preseason six wins eight losses and to toys so, you know, it's not not the best winning percentage. I think they've they've settled down now in terms of their roster. There was a few, you know few sort of  bit of turnover in the plane plane team and I think I think they'll come out the back back side. Okay, but for pre-season, I think you know, they've got a sit sit in third for me next up where I think mainly because don't know huge amount about the last two teams preseason campaigns. The lucky hours are quite quiet on social media, but where  Just purely off the back of you know, they had a success fairly successful season last year going 500 and they also, you know, they were quite far ahead of the lucky ours last season. So I think that I think they'll take take this battle between and but he's a tough division for wear and the lucky ours. So yes, it's got its got be we're in for from the Power Rankings that you know, they had some really tough slider games against the gun.  Playing as the black corpse from Bedford and also Victoria Park Panthers as well in also in the Prem so, you know, but I think you know, I think they can pick up a few victories in this Division and then the lucky ours obviously Locker mentioned a tough tough season last year with one win two ties and nine losses fairly quiet on social media. So, you know, we don't know how how well  their pre-season campaigns gone, but you can't count out London teams. Like I said that their work their ability to recruit is in seconds and them, you know that, you know, you can pick off you can always pick up an athlete in London better than you can with the smaller towns. So yeah, so I thought I think I'll think for pre-season until we've seen some football from them. I think they see in fifth. It's not like I say, it's going to be an interesting interesting.  Week one will see some Lucy some shifts in our I'm excited to see future mashed matchups with London Flash and the Gunslingers also Steam and the Gunslingers as well because that's where you know, we'll get a feel of who's going to take this division. That's it for me for the southeast be edition of the first and 15 podcast check back after  week one where we'll have a week one review and also a week to preview. Yeah. So yeah. Hope you are hope you like it. Hope you like it and you know, like the first and 15 page on Facebook. See you soon. So we'll be looking at the southeast a week one here with  Point more this time, let's look at last season KU Coventry cougars relegated from the Premiership with a 112 and to record and then you had the Titans white winning our division last season 11 on one automatic promotion Bedford Blackhawks nine and three playoff promotion. And then there's the guys that are left which with cough panzers the Lester Huntsman the north hands Titans black team the rugby raccoons and the Coventry cougars ladies. So let's talk about last season.  And how did you find this one? Yeah, well obviously playing for raccoons last year. It was a little bit of a bedding ourselves in finding your feet and just starting to learn how to hang in games and then go on to win and we feel this year. We've added a couple of players and it should help us push on that and say we were caught up in several close games than we could have could have pulled out a couple more wins and I think this year we are going to push on and make quite a big impact in the division.  Coventry cougars coming down and I listened to been talking with you not that long ago. And I know they're going all out to win the division and I think that's their rightly the favorites to win a lot of games this year and probably go straight back up again, but I'd like to think that we can we can push them close and when quite a few games and make it a little bit closer than people may be predicting moved on to next season Coventry cougars. So she said favorites for promotion 14 and one according to flag football world. Who do you see that?  That one loss coming again. So it's got to be against the cougar lady. Doesn't it? It's Just Gotta Be You Know Ben's worried about it more than probably anyone elses. I think 14 and one's a little bit generous. There are brilliant team. They've got so much pace and sometimes youth but I think there's a couple of teams out there that could Sean where one of them certainly we've got a lot of experience. We've got tendai chairs coming back. Hopefully who's probably one of the best corners certainly the one of the top female Corners in the game. So that's going to lock down aside.  This when she's playing but also sometimes we Coventry they're so young. They run you around the field ragged they come up against a very well-organized or a strong defensive team. It might it might turn out a little bit closer than they hope but yeah, I wouldn't shock me that the ladies give him a run. I know I know they've been in a couple of close games with with the lads and I think been alluded to it in the last interview. But yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think they'll win the division but I think 14 and one's probably a little bit Rich for more like probably twelve and  something like that will drop down to their the bottom of the vision. Now the big shock especially in my mind last season Coventry Panthers, eight and four just missing out on the the playoffs this season predicted to go 113 and one. I mean, I know they may have lost a quarterback in Nelms if he's if he's with work issues. They've lost part Lane to the Gunslingers, but do you really see them finishing that low? No, no not at not at all and obviously played for  Couple years ago great bunch of lads great bit of talent there within the team I think addition by subtraction to a certain level because they've merged back from being black and yellow that the yellow team that struggled a lot last year will gain immensely by having a few of the black players coming back in. I know Tom's one of the best coaches I've come up against in opal when we were with the Wolverines and I know I'm sure Tom will actually have them coated well and ready to play and I think  On defense seem Tyler take over the play called in duties and and running that these again, he's a very very good player and I genuinely think they're going to win a few more games. I know they say they're in transition a bit as well. And I totally understand that but I think 130 the ones very very much below what they'll actually achieve. I would think that they've got to be looking at four or five wins. So when we One Step Up the cough cougars ladies to and 13 a team that in my mind a lot of newer teams, especially  You underestimate them and then they will struggle. I mean to be honest. I think we've done it a few times going into the half and we've been very relaxed about the game and it's been very close at the half and we've had to really step up our game and try and drive home the win. Do you think that's where a lot of the other teams will struggle? Yeah. I think sometimes people do I think I think often it's not so much about the actual play. It's just the size, you know, clearly. There's always going to be  Or generally you're going to be a size difference between something most of the girls and my many of the the men in most mainly male-oriented teams. I mean clearly raccoons are all midgets. So there's a little bit there where the size doesn't matter but I think often that that's quite often where the difference comes because play-calling wise and ability and skill level of the cougar ladies is is just fantastic. And obviously we see them just destroy everybody, you know people every year and you know, they get better  They get stronger every year pulled out a couple of wins over the last couple years and I wouldn't be surprised to see them certainly when four or five games potentially as you say, it's sometimes it's on people without realizing it underestimate them. But as soon as you see a couple of plays and you see me, Leo Kelly going going like they do or Grace coming out then I think I think you you start resting on your laurels and you really do raise you have to because you won't be thing without trying hard. We've up again Lincoln.  Longhorns the new voice in the league. They've been predicted six eight and one not bad for a first season. They've had a few games against the roosters. I think they won one last one. They played the Huntsman as well. So they've had a taste of our division, but there's not much that people can really say about them because as I say, we haven't played them ourselves now, you're right. I don't know much about and we know a long-term adversary for a better term in to fill it's gone there and I don't fall.  Minute thinking that he would be there if he didn't think that they were they were poised to make a bit of an impact on the league. So I'm sure they'll be ready to go and set up certainly as you say they can't seem to split most of the couple of games. We know they've played with play two teams a couple of times they seem to split those. I mean, we'd have took six eight and one last year if someone had offered us that so it wouldn't be a surprise to see them. Maybe mirror what we were last year and three and nine four and four and ten something like that somewhere around.  But anyway, so maybe a couple games less off that and obviously the Thai other than how you predict that I very easily for that you go. So I think maybe a couple games less than actually predicted personally. Anyway, I mean, that's probably one of the teams that will through just a lack of seeing them the cough cougars ladies the Longhorns I film a struggle against them because like I said before it's the underestimated as underestimation, that would be their their main downfall in that one and well apparently the draw don't go and buy this will be the Coventry pants.  That should be a good game. I'm not too sure if that's on the first day of the Season or not. But then we move up again. We've got the Lester Huntsman seven and eight last season five and seven. So a better season for them. They've lost Neil at the helm they seem to be doing. All right. Yeah, and they're a good team. They've got a lot of experience there underneath it. I mean Neal's not leaving he's going just move into coaching side. So they've still got all the experience. And again we've seen ourselves with the Wolverines with the  difference he's made to to Nottingham's uni women's team and just having him there. So I'm sure the coaching side and the play calling is going to be pretty strong be honest. Don't know who's going to play quarterback for him. And I apologize for that. I just don't know and then you've still got people like Vinny on the defensive side of the ball. He's a great great Corner. He's always one of these guys you think you've got beads and then you turn around and he's right with you and making plays all over the field. So, you know, and I know last year when we  Then we beat them once and we lost to them once in very tight. Well for games I doubt they're going to drop drop away at all so that they'll be they'll be a real force in there. I'm sure they'll be challenging quite often. I'm sure now if the more difficult one the raccoons ten and five three and nine last season. Obviously, there are first ever season now, they've been predicted second in the division 10 and 5. Do you think we'll be able to do it? Yeah, I think I think technically it's fairly close. I mean  Basically, I think the way I've been talking I think I'm giving everyone seven seven and one on I'm really and so but no II think we've reset I said earlier I think as a team, obviously I have my team a little bit better than everybody else. You know, we're set we've got the core players there Luke Gamble's second year now offer his ACL. So he's another step up. We see that in training and everybody who's ever played very Luke knows. He's impossible sometimes and we pay it plays. I Che returning again and he  Figures to be there more than he was last year. We lost him several games. I think that will help us quite a bit as I say tendo chairs a May. Well be starring for us at Corner at some point during the year, which again gives us a real boost, but you know, just generally we're very similar teams last year and the couple of additions we did make late in the year performed brilliantly, you know Outlaw ofl and I just think that should drive us on and again clearly in a mark as a call back another year behind  Finding with the play calling. And again, I will come back to the Wolverines with the Wolverines have done very well recently under under his tutelage or your tutelage. And also just that development a good playbook that goes into the kind of strength we've got which is generally very fast smaller players. So we've on to week one or the games we going on that day, but we're let's have a quick look at some of them first game cougars Coventry Cooper's men's  First the Lincoln Longhorns, how do you see this one going? Because I feel sorry for the long ones on that. That's that's a baptism of fire, isn't it? I'm assuming they've never seen the Cougars men play and not as far as I know. I mean that is a whirlwind you've got bends back or back as far as I know and we still got Kieran eaten there and just those two alone is just it's spectacular sometimes to see some of the some of the movement in the plays and the  Passes and I just think they're just going to outclass the longhorn straight away and I it's not to demean them at all. As I said, I haven't seen them play. But the Cougars are definitely yay a strong fast young team, and I just don't see most people living with that when you've never really seen it before so I'm guessing you're predicting a Cougars win six now.  Yeah, definitely. I would be very very surprised if that was much worse than 26 another game that day Coventry cougars men's again against us when we both predicted the the top two spots.  How do you see this one? Go? Yeah, I think what we've got to do there is use the family connections and really get the banter and get into Ben's head and kieran's head which I'm going to rely on you and Luke to to really get get something going there and put them off at a game. I think offensively we've got quite a good fire power as I said earlier this season and I can see it being quite a close relatively high scoring game. We know we're not going to be able to stop the Cougars every Drive hats that's almost impossible, but I think the same  Goes for us I think they're going to find it quite a handful with with what we've got there. So I've got to say we win so it will be 32 31 to to the raccoons, but it will be pretty high scoring and I'm sure it will close game. I mean it is like I said, it is difficult to try and predict that game. It's the big game of the season for us. Yeah, so obviously I am going to side with my team my seven national championships over Ben's none. We'll move on to the next one. Okay, because  starts the Cougars ladies verse the Lester Huntsman cougars ladies to and 13 predicted Huntsman seven and eight.  But mean obviously Neil knows the Cougars ladies very well. He's been with them for years. He knows how they play but will you be able to teach that into his Squad at this stage? And that's where I think actually the big difference will come. I think the Cougars ladies against another team would probably have a good chance. I just think the any little Hamlet we prepared generally they're our biggest unit of players as well. They're more there's some bigger X kitted players on I remember seeing last year a couple that and I think  Isn't it no disrespect at all to the ladies but there is definitely a big size difference but sensually there and I think often that as I said earlier that that can often be the difference for the girls. It's you know, it's not that their lack of physicality in any way shape or form they'll go for everything and I've seen some amazing stuff, but don't just generally the size of the Huntsman will probably tell and and yeah, as you said Neil, he knows he knows what he's going to come up against here. We are the scheme for it a little bit and again, I think it was  A fairly close I'd think you're looking something like 2014 18 something around that maybe I think it'd be quite tight, but I think nothing there was experience. And so you're going for the Huntsville. I'm going to silence women just by the city. It's to do players and teams. Underestimate the Kook ladies. I don't think Neil will and he'll love that drilled into the team pretty well, but I'll be honest. I'm going to go for the Cougars ladies on this one. So close as well. But yeah, I mean, there's no other way. This could be one of the first wins of the season for them. I think that will be  Available push and it's got nothing to do with the fact that I will be there. Most Saturday's training with them. Of course last game we're going to look at is the the Coventry Panthers Versa Longhorns. This is the game that I'm guessing that flag. Football World said, that would be the draw. Do you see it happening as a draw? Yeah. It's got that. It's got to be the game. That's the drawer isn't it in from their way? You know what I'd be better off telling you after I've seen the first games because you know clearly we've said already that although I think  think Panthers are better than the forecasted and the predictions until I see him play until I see how Tom and Tyler have pulled that team together and and what games they made against the got the yellow team last year. It's hard to judge and clearly as we said the Longhorns and you know, I feel really sorry, but I just don't know that much about them. I'm going to go with the Panthers win. Just because  Hopefully it's ago and I do think they all there's still some good experience there and it should just about telling the end. I'm going to say it's beef quite high scoring. I'm going to say probably 26:24 something like that. It all depends. I think in my mind if they have a quarterback, obviously they had James Nails last year if he's busy with work. I mean, I know he's a very busy man and this stage. Is he going to be able to come down to train and quite often or is he just going to be up?  Turn up on game days. And if it does turn up at all if I think if they have James Nelms at quarterback, I've seen no doubt and then winning this one no offense to I'm not too sure who their quarterback would be if they don't have a quarterback. I could a decent one to step in I see them struggling and I can see a longhorn win. I mean that they've played a few decent teams deployed. The reason I said the roosters a huntsman the Manchester Titans as well. So I'm going to go the other way again. Not that I  ever like to disagree with you, but I'm going to go for the Longhorns but one option that I have heard a quarterback for the Panthers is kind of Baron. Apparently, he's coming back from Lincoln with back down to Coventry. Apparently he signed for a second favorite team the Panthers. I mean, you know, he's I'm sure we will clearly knew that the roku's was set at quarterback and it was a bit pointless trying to oust in other markets or Shea from from their positions and it fair play to him. Good luck if he goes there.  Again, he brings the amazing skill set to the Panthers. And if you actually does play then that would not be bad and interestingly is moved from Lincoln. So does he know more about them than we realize well, that's another game that Longhorns played actually played Lincoln University. I think again, they won one last one. So I'm not too sure if Connor was involved in that stick that in that team because when you recruiting him, oh, I'm always recruiting we know this but yeah I said that would be the main difference.  Maker, so it's going to be the quarterbacks in this one do the Panthers have James Nelms do they have kind of Baron if you have Connor baronies a good receiver, but he's also a fairly decent quarterback. Do you step you put them into their there's a lot of questions that I think are going to be answered on this first game day. Obviously a misty missing this season from our division is the north hands Titans. They've had to drop down to one team. Do you see them struggling in the Premiership but in so many players that mean they've gone from three squads  A 2-1. I mean, you know how much like spreading the squad out and her team sometimes but do you see them struggling in the Premiership with all those extra players? I don't think so because they've lost a bid of the attrition has come to the Gunslingers hasn't it as we know so there yes, they've taken one on one of my favorite players players ever in Nathan goals. So he's gone Jordan's fantastic fantastic player. And obviously The Man Behind. Oh f  Well, and you know that's taken the made the Gunslingers very good team northants, you know the still got the tables if they've still got Lee playing nest and somehow even a and mats at quarterback as far as I'm aware and he looks to be developing every year. I've seen him come from you know, basically being a receiver and a young girl ad and and playing a bit of quarterback behind some of the more established guys to making up position his own. I'm not sure if Arden's now we type  I died like unbelievably complicated. Yeah, it's so he's gone to kitten and that's a major loss because clearly defensively he was he was a linchpin but they've still got really good talent. They've got the Fantastic youth team that I'm sure everyone knows is as pretty much dominated their their their class for two or three seasons or being up there with the Cougars most of the time in that. So again, you know that they're filtering those players through and you've got the tibbles to tibbles two tables kind of connection regularly.  And let's be honest. They've known each other all their lives literally rather than just figuratively. So again that does count for something. So yeah, the premise ships difficult. There's no arguing that but I don't think they'll be as bad as maybe you might think and they say they've lost some of those players say, yes, those three teams. Some of those guys have gone and probably drifted away as well again. I played from a few years ago, and it's a great one to Lance and it's a really good little setup. We've got there and you know,  Credit to and I hope they do do well actually, so just to recap this first game days predictions cougars cough cougars men's first a Longhorns. We've both gone for the Cougars cough cougars against the raccoons. Obviously, we've both gone for the raccoons the Cougars ladies first the Huntsman I've gone for the Cougars ladies you've gone for the Huntsman and the cough Panthers Longhorns game swap again, you've gone for the Panthers and I've gone for the Longhorns.  So hopefully after this first game day will be able to come back and say well hopefully what you were on even got the first to write but obviously somebody's going to be wrong in the last one. So yeah looking forward to seeing how that all works out.  Hello, this is Andrew from London smoke coming to you recording live from Cancun Airport. Yes, we are bringing an international section for this first SEC Prem podcast witty title suggestions are more than welcomed. We have been out there for those of you that don't know we've been out here for the Cancun Bowl tournament. Yes, we finished where we'll meet.  Could two and two record but we did lose to the first and third place teams and it was a fun tournament much tequila earring much attack is I would definitely recommend for those that can do. So without further Ado. Let's get into it. This will be a shortened version of the section because well I am by myself in an airport lounge and I am getting looks already so  First of all before my voice completely goes let's just address that this is the conference of Champions. This is the conference of the previous three title winners. This is a conference that has European tournament winners. This is a conference that has players of GB quality wafer out its ranks and well, it's gonna be a fantastic year. It is the conference of death. So I'll start with the newly  a to smoke my team the I'll try not to be too much of a home are obviously coming up and beaten in division one the core of Charlie Henry and Johnny clearly just worked far too good for that Division and hopefully that will continue in this division is the squad that's really expanding as we added our second team London flash this year, which is really allowed us to add depth and find some quality new players that hopefully  it will really contribute this year reading lines. They had a terrible start last year, but stayed Strong finish strong right behind keeping Nick there the GB silver QB and I think they've finished seven and seven. If I'm right Victoria Park Panthers, they've they've added you and Miller which is a great acquisition for them. I'm glad to see he's back fit. I've seen him about in The Go mammoth leagues and recently with the SEC tournament.  I really think you'll add another dimension to that offense. This is a team that's been quite well schemed, but hopefully this will start to add some more athleticism the really see them compete at the top of the division next moving on to the rebels great history in the sport here with Calvin and all the surrounding full of athletes again. They've been the ones challenging Baker Street and well hopefully smoke will be alongside those two and of course mentioning Baker Street NE  The vents post together is going to be competitive and I'm hearing rumors of defensive or offensive additions that really could take this team to a new level. So it should be a fantastic year for the SEC Conference offered out of the day. I have a flight in half an hour, but I promised better content hot guests.  Maybe not hot. But the leading stars of the conference will be in this podcast. Let's see how we go on goes this weekend. This episode find us on Facebook at first and 15 podcast.

Today is Friday, January 24th 2020 on this day in 1989 serial, killer and rapist Ted Bundy was executed via electric chair in a Florida penitentiary.  Welcome to today and True Crime a podcast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're covering the execution of 42 year old Theodore Ted Bundy the serial murderer responsible for the rapes assaults and deaths of numerous young women during the 1970s. Let's go back to Florida State Prison on January.  Earth 1989 early in the morning  The sun wasn't even up yet in Northeast, Florida when it did finally rise 42 year old Ted. Bundy wouldn't be outside or Alive to see it. He'd been waiting on death row for almost 10 years the smell of eggs and buttered toast entered his Spartan sell a little before 5 a.m. Bundy stared at the plate, but didn't move to touch it. Maybe he knew.  At the night before just 45 minutes West dozens of college students had feasted in celebration of his impending execution one of Florida State University's fraternities organized a cookout. It was a twisted but fitting Memorial to the women of the Chi Omega sorority that Bundy had sexually assaulted and killed in 1978, but the FSU  sides weren't all that had led Bundy to death row over a span of four years from 1974 until 1978. He'd assaulted and killed dozens of women across the United States in the days leading up to his execution Bundy admitted to a total of 30 homicides though investigators suspected. The number could be far higher they feared it was likely closer to a hundred.  Whether or not Ted was privy to the numerous Bundy cues that were held across the south is unknown, but he knew the majority of the American public welcomed his execution. So he pushed away the standard steak and eggs and hash browns spread. He'd been asked by the prison if he wanted a special meal, but he declined instead of eating he sat staring at the walls of the nine by 14 foot cell.  There was nothing else to do but wait in silence. He was all prayed out his Minister Fred Lawrence had been with him past midnight, but the strident barrier of cell bars proved that there was nothing further than Methodist preacher could do for Bundy as 6 a.m. Neared. One of the prison guards came for him. He was tasked with shaving portions of Bundy's head and right leg the electrodes of the chair couldn't adhere to the skin.  If there was too much coarse hair after that Bundy changed from the prison-issued jumpsuit into a monochromatic blue shirt and pants as the clock ticked to 7 a.m. He was led out of his shoe box cell by his wrist shackles.  The walk to the execution chamber was short about 10 yards. The room itself was partitioned on one side was the chair and Bundy through a hefty Plexiglas window were 42 on Lookers many of those who had chosen to watch the event were officials involved in the Kimberley leech trial. She was a twelve-year-old seventh grader Bundy had abducted and brutally killed 11 years before the Arab.  Of the rows of witnesses was thick and somber no one's stirred as Bundy was led across the adjoined room to a heavy wooden chair next to it stood emotionless executioner his black hood cloaking him in anonymity Bundy sat down. They strapped him into the chair. He locked eyes with his lawyer James Coleman through the window when the prison superintendent swung a microphone to Bundy's.  Mouth for any final words Bundy again looked towards his attorneys gaze. He spoke evenly Jim and Fred. I'd like you to give my love to my family and friends the Executioner waited until he finished speaking to place the last strap under Bundy's chin as it tightened. His eyes bulged on Lookers reported that he clamped his eyes open and shut  Italy then they covered Bundy's face with a hood before the electrode to conduct the electricity into his body was secured with that the prison superintendent nodded to the Executioner at 7:06. Am the current connected to the chair surged for 60 seconds 2,000 volts passed from the connection points into Bundy's body.  And then the current kicked off the atmosphere was tense as everyone waited for protocol to dictate what would happen next in tandem the chief prison doctor Frank kill go and a paramedic made their final checks the EMT monitored Bundy's weakening pulse before the doctor removed the hood to check his pupils 10 minutes after the electric shock at 7:16 a.m.  Dr. Kiehl go confirmed. Bundy was dead. The prison Lieutenant Don Davis stepped forward and spoke plainly the sentence of the State of Florida versus Theodore. Bundy has been carried out but the droves of people waiting outside the prison for proof that the execution was complete wouldn't hear this upwards of a hundred lingered outside the barbed wire coils waiting for the Hallmarks.  Symbol they knew a reporter was to emerge flapping a notebook and just a few minutes later a yellow notepad was spotted waving in the wind outside. The prison the response from the crowd was jarring people burst into song high-fiving and clapping the hooting created an eerie raucous din, naturally as the witnesses and officials trickled out of the penitentiary doors. They met this  this grisly scene. No one could disagree that Bundy was a sociopath the events of that morning were carried out as expected still the Delight in death was stomach-churning.  Coming up. We'll look at the cultural response to Ted Bundy's execution now back to the story on Tuesday, January 24th, 1989 serial killer Ted Bundy was executed by the electric chair in a Florida prison the morning marked the end to an especially dark Saga of American culture as Bundy's numerous victims were mourned and remembered in the Years following his execution.  Is often return to the affable mood that blanketed crowds outside Florida state prison with all their hollering and carousing the onlookers could have been at a carnival or Festival that is if not for their various t-shirts and signs indicating. They were present for the Friday some had even fashioned impromptu hats from aluminum foil to mimic the headpiece that accompanied the electric chair and more those contributing.  To the reverberating chorus of burn Bundy burn included parents with their young kids. Some people felt it was appropriate.  It's clear that Bundy's execution served as an outlet for the American public to obtain some sort of catharsis after following the harrowing span of Bundy's crimes over a decade even those unaffected by his murders. Wanted to see Justice. They were looking for some tangible acknowledgement that the women Bundy had brutally assaulted couldn't be brought back the lives. He had maimed and taken innocent families had been wrenched into  if and forced to Grapple with the results of losing their daughters sisters or cousins many that attended the execution agreed on the fact that the punishment was due to Bundy a man who had expressed No Remorse for his crimes was ushered out of the world with the same attitude in the parking lot and surrounding streets of the penitentiary a massive crowd aired their sorrow and anger they felt  That Bundy's nearly 10 years on death row was a grievous error after all courts had handed down three different death sentences during his numerous murder trials.  But the audacious attitude of not only the crowd outside the prison but the surrounding communities marked that Bundy's execution in and of itself was not enough light boxes outside restaurants displayed fry themed menus for that day special broadcasts on news channels provided live video feeds of the Hearst leaving the prison and turning onto the Interstate towards Gainesville one.  Tris working at a diner down the street from the prison seem to capture the complex mood of the day. She was new to Florida and unsettled by both the scope of Bundy's crimes and the response to his death according to the Washington Post. She spoke with a grim frankness. This is my first one we're from Texas. They execute a lot of people in Texas, but I've never seen a crowd like this before.  It kind of says something about Humanity, don't it?

What's up, Podcast listeners Matt Matthews here? This is my first podcast ever. I did not plan to make a podcast just like everything else in my life. It's usually kind of thrown at me and I decided to go with it. So if you are listening and don't know who I am already, I am a Boudoir photographer author educator basically all of the things I am based in Birmingham, Alabama and I travel the world.  Old and teach workshops and photograph beautiful women and teach other humans the art of so forth. So forth is something that I think that we should all learn to be grateful and to love our bodies and to be fucking amazing. Also I curse a lot. So if you don't like cursing this is probably not the podcast for you. So I just wanted to start out this first podcast was just thanking you guys for watching and listening.  Inning and dealing with my hot mess Express and all the bullshit that may come along with this again. This is my first one so don't come for me. If it's all fucked up today on this first podcast. I want to talk to you guys about self-worth and it's something that I like to talk about a lot and something that I really preach on when I go to events and when I go wherever the fucking gun, so basically if  Found on stop blowing up on trying to make this damn podcast. I'm gonna have a problem. So basically I am a big self-worth Advocate. If you don't know what Boudoir photography is, I photograph women and make them feel amazing about themselves and give them a little bit of confidence in themselves. And that is that's the whole point of Boudoir photography and why I do what I do, but I also teach other photographers and other humans and Inspire other people because I came from a really shitty background.  And I want to just kind of talk a little bit with you about that. I just recently wrote a book. Damn. I'm jumping all over the place, but it's okay. So I recently wrote a book. It's called uncovered the nekkid truth of life love and addiction and that's just about my shit show of a life. I grew up poor I grew up, you know with not a whole lot and I grew up with a family of addicts and a family of drug and drug addicts and alcoholism and you know a bunch of shit around me that I just should not be  Where I am today, and I knew that statistically I would become the same thing that I saw because as children, we perpetuate the same things that we see growing up. So I knew the things that I didn't want to become so I knew the things that I wanted to strive to overcome and to and to beat I knew that I wanted to beat the cycle and be something better. And so my entire Journey was hard I grew up, you know with a lot of rough things happening, especially with an alcoholic as a birth mother.  And drug addicts for siblings and living in trailer parks and living in the projects which is kind of why I'm half redneck and half ghetto. I mean, you know it is what it is. You got to get it how you live. So I had a really rough childhood and things happen in my life. That should not have happened. I found dead people along the way lots of good stuff that is all in my book. I'll post the link for you guys. If you want to purchase a copy of that shit is only 1795. So you got to get it how you live baby Barnes & Noble  Design website ever what you want to get you can get at it but I'm really proud of my book. It took a really long time to write and it was a really hard process for me. It was really healing and I learned throughout my life that we faced struggles and we Face things in our lives that make us a better person ultimately if we if we learn how to deal with them and we deal with them correctly and we learn how to heal and move from those things. Like I said statistically I should be a drug addict or I should be an alcoholic or I should be in a ditch.  Somewhere I should not be a successful photographer or an author or any of the things that I am but because I broke that cycle I was able to get where I am today and you know being able to break that cycle comes from cutting people out of your lives that aren't meant to be there and that's a whole nother shitshow of an episode on its own. But you know, that's just part of it and I just really am excited about  This podcast Journey. I'm excited about sharing more of my journey with you. This podcast is not just going to be photography related. It is everybody. I want it to be a very inspirational thing for everyone.

Hey guys, Sarah McNamara here with the Wizards of Ops podcast. I thought we would talk about account-based marketing and especially about ABM platforms this week. I know that it was something that came up in my full time job as we're looking at the new year and how we can use existing ABM platforms. The question of do we need more or what the heck are we doing with it in general that topic came up internally and I posted about it on LinkedIn and there was a lot of interest and a lot of the same questions happening other businesses as well. So I thought that talking about how to pick the right ABM platform would be a fantastic topic because it Loops in the ABM platform topic and then also honestly, I think some of the best advice I can give you guys as  Someone who's been in Consulting and seeing a hell of a lot of different messes and also success is how to properly vet the platform that you're looking to buy or the to honestly vet the platform to see if it's going to solve the problem or the opportunity that you have. So before we hop into that I want to give a shout out to otamatone. If you go to otamatone inc.com, you can check out their tool called Atomic test. It does automated testing. So  If I want to make sure that I can submit a lead through a web form and then it goes through all the the anticipated data transformation to be prepped to be sent into Salesforce and to hit my is our cue I can set that all up and atomic tests. I can have it make sure that all that's happening and I can even schedule it to be recurring so we can make sure that web isn't changing the hidden fields on certain forms or even something as simple as  Someone setting up a form and making a typo or something like that. It's a really great tool to essentially help you get more arms and eyes and ears all throughout the different platforms that you're in charge of and marketing operations. We also are running a great little partnership program where basically if you take certain actions and I'll make sure to include this in the podcast subscription then your self nominating yourself to potentially get  $200 certification stipend. So if you're looking to get a new certification in 2020 where whether it be Marketo Salesforce, pardot, whatever it is, or if you're looking to invest in some education like a udemy course or any of the Salesforce courses out there. We are giving a stipend away to someone so check out the qualifications. Go ahead and do them. Make sure you honestly I would check out the to latam a test.  Anyways, because I found it to be really useful but certainly that's a great incentive to do it as well. So thanks to them for sponsoring this episode and let's dive right into it. So and honestly a lot of these questions really apply for any kind of platform that you're trying to purchase in the marketing world. So I would honestly say these apply for any of those but the first question I always start with  What are you looking for? And that sounds really basic but a lot of companies don't really start with that or they get lost along the way something that's key that I always do whether it be, you know, amongst myself before I present or ask questions of different marketing teams, or if we all get together and do it is to really map out. What is the problem that I'm trying to solve or what is opportunity that I see? I know that when I look at plot different software.  I am considering a hole that I see and the leader customer process. So even as a b2c customer if I have a stellar experience with something then I want to tell my marketing teams about it and see what we can do to emulate it if they also see that value. So make sure that you define what you're looking for. So you can use it as a North star to understand if the different platforms are really meeting your needs or if they aren't.  Because what I see happen, a lot of times is people get into the buying process and Reps put out a million bells and whistles and exciting hype around things and people get distracted and then end up buying something that you know, sounded great and there were some cool features but didn't really even solve the initial problem or the initial desire. So make sure that you have that and you can always refer back to it as you feel like you're being taken off.  Of your mission something else that is really important to check in on is making sure that you have the bandwidth. This is a great question for your marketing Ops Team. If you're more of a general marketer, please do check in with them around what big projects and initiatives they have going on for the next few quarters and then allow them to check in with different groups like it and sales Ops we work with those folks all the time and depending upon what each org is doing.  In any given quarter we can become bottle next to each other because we're too busy to fulfill a ticket or something like that. So it's really good to make sure that everyone has an idea of what you're looking to do. Why are looking to do it and if they have the bandwidth to be able to deliver in the timeframe that you're hoping for another question that comes to my mind is can the vendor show that it will actually work and I mean show me that it will work. I don't mean tell me about it. I  I mean send me a white paper. I mean, I really want to see it working if they can't show it themselves for some kinds of logistical reason that I asked for a customer reference. So maybe they can show me how it's working for them. But make sure that they can do that. There's a lot of honestly even confusion among sales reps about what actually is possible or not. And so it helps everyone in the scenario to understand what really is possible and to see it firsthand.  And something else that kind of goes along the same string is Integrations. I feel like I am a broken record on this topic, but I cannot tell you enough the value of really great Integrations. And when you're talking about something like account-based marketing, it's that times like 10 integrate Brill building custom Integrations is super expensive. I want to say I haven't seen one built for probably less than  Maybe like ten thousand or so unless you're like a really small business because of all the different, you know, custom development work. It might take or planning or workarounds and all of that. So if someone says they have an integration again have them show it to you or at least give you detailed documentation on what to expect because there's also a lot of confusion or I would say misrepresentation even around what  Word integration means I've had different vendors tell me that they have an integration with pardot and it's wonderful and then I say, okay, let me see it and they pull up sales for sales Cloud that is not part out folks. It's not the same thing. So yeah, make sure that you can see what exactly they're talking about. I also see Integrations that are kind of half-baked. I know that I recently saw one with I think it was Outreach. No. No, I already chose bomber.  Aura where they required some kind of like scoring change or something something that was kind of nonsensical and a lot more work than I think anyone had anticipated when they heard that there was an integration with Bambara. So the more detail you can get on all of the stuff the better including implementation when it comes to the question about the bandwidth make sure that you get as much detail as you can on what it will take to implement the software. I'm telling you nothing.  Set it and forget it. I remember a few years ago. Everything was being sold almost like one of those infomercials just buy it and then set it and forget it. I'm telling you. It doesn't work that way setting it takes a lot longer than anyone anticipated and no one is forgetting it so make sure that you prioritize those things because as a marketer if you're spending a lot of money on a platform you want to make sure you can show some kind of return on investment or that I can help you look at it your job within a  a time frame that makes sense if it's going to take six months to even get in place. Well, that's something good to set expectations around with upper management before it gets to that point and upper management is like what the heck? Why don't we buy this? You know, what are we doing with our we're not doing anything. Will it get rid of it and just kind of bad. So make sure that you go over that and all that stuff and detail get it in writing and that will save you a hell of a lot of time.  Him and trouble and confusion and really should help get you back to that question one, which is isn't going to solve the problem or give us the opportunity that we're looking for and that will give you the as much success as you possibly can get with a different vendors that are out there. Please do submit to the survey. If you do use any of these account-based marketing platforms. I have an anonymous survey out there. So  so that we can collect data and I'm hoping to put out something like the salary survey that I have for marketing operations so that we can just get some transparency around what's being sold and what's being delivered on and what people are actually experiencing and ironically as I look through some of the kind of OpenText answers that people have put in a lot of them have talked about a lot of the topics in kind of my vetting process like being sure that someone said prep work is everything someone said to  Advantage of the training or you're going to fail. Someone said that they were having a rough time implementing the Integrations and actually getting the data where they needed it. So I would love to hear your experiences. If you're using any of these platforms so we can get to the bottom of which platforms are going to work for which people and that is something important to remember even if another company is having a great time with a platform. It may meet their needs, but not yours.  URS so it goes back to making sure that you understand what your needs are what your current Tech stack looks like what you're trying to solve and what you're trying to get. So I hope this helped you guys out. Thanks so much for your support. If it did help you. Please do share on LinkedIn or Twitter and catch you next time.

My father gave me the most a life-changing advice when I was a young boy. He said Louis the world will buy you at the price you sell yourself now as a young boy, I didn't quite understand what this advice meant. What exactly does that mean? I thought about this advice for a long time and as my life went on I learned that  The more valuable you make yourself the more useful you are to people and to the world. For example, when you go to school to become a doctor people look to you for medical help. If you become a dancer people look to you for entertainment. Now, there are all kinds of ways that our society value is by for example, the cool kid the nerd the awkward kid or even the butt of the joke most of the  time the way we sell ourselves can have a negative effect on us. Some people don't in any way try to sell themselves as people perceive them to be but all that can change by the daily choices we make and how we choose to develop ourselves personal development is one of the key factors to you thriving in life and selling yourself at a price you want the world to buy you for I think is  Profound that we can change the way the World Views us we can change the course of Our Lives sometimes instantly or Brick by Brick one of the most precious gifts given to you as a human is the ability to change the course of your life.  Anytime anywhere according to your desire. This is called agency or the power to choose. So who said you can't change your life from being the awkward kid to be in the charismatic kid. Who said you can change your life from being the shy kid to be in the outgoing kid who said you can't change yourself from being the butt of the joke to be in the respect that kid who said you can't change from a low value which you are not.  Or never meant to be to be someone a hundred times more valuable to the world or Society who said you cannot change.  The world is constantly buying.  Good or bad they're buying at which price are you willing to sell yourself?  My dad once said I sold myself a powerful influence and a man of service and that's what the world but me for my father is one of the few men that I know who sold himself at a good price at which the world but him a goodly man brothers and sisters the world will buy you at the price you sell yourself. So at which price  Are you willing to tell yourself? I've chosen my father's way, which is selling myself to be a powerful influence and a man of service and hopefully the word of by me as a godly man. So my challenge to every single one of you is to discover at which price are you willing to sell yourself?  What are you willing to become to be able to thrive in his world?  Brothers and sisters, I urge every single one of you.  To think about this question and have it be on your mind constantly because the world is buying good or bad.  Thank you, everyone. This is Louis be on self inspiration. I'll catch you all next time.
My name is dr. Yasi Pujols. I'm a clinical psychologist and Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. Today is Friday April 5th, 2019. And today I am talking about the psychology of food cravings.  So just wanted to jump in with a little scenario at home. I live with other people who are not always weight cutting and who are a little bit Freer with their food selections walking through the kitchen at the house is very very interesting for me because the I guess the food storage doesn't all go into the  Entry and so countertops are a common space for snacks and bread and sweets and pretty much anything else to live on.  It can be very challenging when you're walking through a space at home and other people's fun foods are present when your eyes see that food you begin a process of savoring.  Thinking about trying some and then the negotiations start your brain is telling you I want that I want that right now and the responsible reasonable part of your brain that knows you need to monitor what you're taking in for whatever reason for your weight gold and traditional goal that part starts telling you know, why do I need that right now? I don't need that that's going to throw me off my weight goal.  And then there's this a back and forth battle and just a few moments while you're walking into or walking through the kitchen.  The one way I've found to really counter just seeing food that I don't want to eat.  Is to just tuck it away cover it put it in a in the cabinet put it back into the pantry just to minimize the struggle.  That that you may have when just living and chilling at your house.  It might also help to ask others to collect their food bread is an easy one, there's covers and you could throw a what is that like a hand towel over it or just in case it in something and the chips bags can can be tucked away as well and the refrigerator can be arranged in a way where you're not trigger.  To kind of snack on something like cheese cubes cheese cubes are delicious, but they don't really help when it comes to maintaining your weight or even losing weight. So if you aren't the person that goes grocery shopping to kind of minimize some of those purchases then, you know, try to negotiate where those items live in the kitchen in the pantry and then  Work on what kind of snacks you can have available for yourself? So whenever I'm walking through the kitchen and I'm feeling kind of snacky. I like to have a stash of like cut fresh vegetables. For example carrot sticks are phenomenal snacking Foods why it takes a long time to choose some carrots. So it keeps the mind busy. It keeps you.  doing something, especially if it's a little carrot sticks, you know makes you feel active but people often think that like it's the the behavior the new sub having something in your hand rather than  Actually wanting food and that's another point, you know, sometimes we just we just want to eat because we're bored. So back up out of that kitchen go back to what you were doing set a timer for 15 minutes and I guarantee if it's a mind craving the craving will go away.  Well, anyways, that was my food for thought for today. Hope you have a great rest of the day and thank you for listening.  Well, anyways, that was my food for thought for today. Hope you have a great rest of the day and thank you for listening.
Hi, my name is David. I'm a compulsive overeater in a food addict and  I'm going to start out kind of qualifying and talking a little bit about my current life situation. And then I'm going to dive into step 3 because I like to look for things which practically really helped me and step three really helps me. I mean all the steps help me but right now step three is really up and I want to share some ideas and thoughts about it around it.  So as I I've been in program for I've been in program twice, the first time I was in program was like 42 years ago for a year.  And I lost a lot of weight.  And I didn't work the steps. I kind of treated it more as a food program, but I did carry wave some things from it, which I've never lost like the Serenity Prayer.  So I came back into program about 23 years ago because my life was under my wife felt like it was completely falling apart and it was too painful and I knew I knew then I knew I was a compulsive overeater and I was using food and I had gained a lot of weight. There's no question that I needed some help.  I was also married I have three kids and I also was coming to terms more than not completely with my sexuality and it was just too big a bridge the gap to jump the world felt very scary Phil dark and I was at my Wit's End I was desperate. This is a good place to be when you come into.  Graham as it turns out although you can come in to present anyway, and by the way, what I'm going to share is just my own experience strength and hope and I don't speak for oh as a whole so take what you like and leave the rest. So  I've been in program continuously for 23 years. I've had a couple relapse has my last relapse was open more than 10 years ago. I don't really count it the days or the months or years, but I probably 12 years ago or something. It doesn't matter as much as what today is for me.  And I'll get into that in a minute in a minute. I'm blessed with great relationships with my children great relationship with my ex-wife some very close friends with a job that I just recently transitioned into I'm 66, and I started a new job for months ago. It's crazy and it's a job which  I couldn't have imagined being able to do.  I certainly couldn't be doing if I wasn't abstinent.  And if I wasn't working the steps and I still pinch myself, I mean interviewing people all the time for this job. I mean to hire people in the job and they asked me while I'm there and I tell them while I'm there and I get very fired up on the inside because that's how I feel. I am in I am so fortunate and this program has played an enormous part in me being able to show up for this job.  His job as it turns out is really hard for me.  It's stretching me in ways that I don't like to be stretched.  and  yesterday I had to give a leadership presentation.  215 of my peers  And I've been preparing it. I've been worrying about it for two months and I've been preparing it for three weeks and it didn't go as well as I'd hoped because I ran into audio visual problems and all sorts of things and and I reflected back on it last night. And I said, well what how did I make it through the presentation? I got some feedback that I look calm and I'm going what so I felt just scared on the inside. So what I did last night  And this morning was reread step 3 in the new OE 12 by 12 the second edition.  And I want to share about some of the reading that was meaningful to me because this is something that actually I use this isn't a theory.  This is something that really makes a difference in my life.  So I'm going to use I have a little device here which has the book on it and it has some passages on it. I'm going to read some from some of the passages and I'm going to comment on it and thank you. So turn this little puppy on. Okay, so set step 3. So for those of you that are new to program, there are 12 steps.  And it's helpful to work them in order.  You don't have to but it's helpful and suggested step 3 one might say well God have been in program for 23 years and you're talking about step 3. Yep. And sometimes I'm talking about step one and it's completely fine. This isn't something that you get and then you move on you never think about it. Again. This is something live.  So step three is made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God.  And it's the spiritual principle of faith.  So for me, my personality is very fear-based.  And before this program, I really didn't have faith that things would work out. I lacked faith and through this program. I've been able to establish a higher power that I can believe in.  And then exercise my faith.  so  when I read last night because I had I had to have faith yesterday when I was in that meeting that I would be. Okay, and I was actually feeling my heart power right next to me almost blowing through me saying you're going to be okay. You're going to be okay you're going to be okay that was really helpful, especially when like, I was trying to play a video in front of all these people and it didn't work and I couldn't get the sound working and I couldn't figure it out and  Big part of me. Just wanted to just run away right there and my old self would have not only wanted to run away would have wanted to run away to some place that I could just binge my head off right because it's so painful. There's so much shame that I felt in that moment. But with his program I could go. All right. I'm feeling shame. Okay.  And I could even joke about the people boy. Oh boy. This is this is an example of what I'm talking about because I was talking about ways of being in fear. This is this is a company as a leadership program and I used my current state as an example. And that was helpful. Could I have done that before program? No way.  So I read I read the literature. I read step 3 last night and I reread it a few times. I read the old version and I read the new version and I thought okay. I wanted to I wanted to read something that was actually meaningful me meaningful to me and really meaningful in the moment. So that's that's that is what is Meaningful. So I'm going to  Passages and I'm going to comment on them. It has been said that the first three steps of Overeaters Anonymous program are simply I can't God. Can I think I'll let God so step 3 is the third one. I think I'll let God.  and  it's a it's a it's a real experience. I have had enough. I've been in program enough and been able to have work with amazing sponsors and responses and have experiences that I can actually feel a presence greater than myself and it doesn't mean that it's a particular. It's not the it's not the god or higher power of my upbringing. It's something different, but it feels real to me.  That's all that matters and some people I know they feel it in the group. I feel it more in the energy and of the world. I just feel it and I feel grateful that I can feel it. However, you feel it. However, you define it. It's completely fine. And as long as it's yours.  Higher power is yours. You get to make your higher power you get to Define your higher power you get to do something that's important, too.  Note that we have said this step step 3 is simple we have not said that it is easy. It is not easy because for every one of us this decision means that we must now adopt a new and unfamiliar way of thinking and acting on life.  From now on we let go of our preconceived notions about what is right for us.  When faced with choices, we earnestly seek guidance from our higher power and when that guidance comes we act on it our new way of life begins with a willingness to adopt a whole new attitude about weight control body image and eating.  So what is willingness and how do we get willingness? It's a really good question.  For me sometimes willingness is like I'm aware of an intention.  and sometimes I think I don't really feel completely willing to do that intention to act on that intention and sometimes it's helpful for me to act as if  Just just pretend that I'm going to do it. I'm willing to do it. I don't really feel willing but just act it and see where I go. See what we see see what space I get to see where I see what actions I take and that's sometimes really helpful. It doesn't I haven't required a complete emotional spiritual transformation in order to be willing. Sometimes it happens, but I don't but a lot of times it doesn't and a lot of times  So much fear around something that even that I know I should be willing. I don't really feel willing.  But what I can do is say okay. I'm just going to act as if I'm going and I'm going to imagine my higher power is right next to me and I'm going to take that first step for step might be boy. I really want to eat something right now.  Okay, the step is just pause.  Or the step might be like it happened to me yesterday boy. I really run want to run away because I did this presentation that I was hoping was going to go perfectly is not and they're all looking at me staring at me trying to get the controls to work.  Am I willing to sit there and be in this chair and be true to myself in this moment?  And let my higher power Guide Me In This Moment.  Not completely, but I'll act as if for this moment.  A lot of willingness for me takes courage.  So I can be willing and I know it's the right thing, but I am scared.  And I since I know my car Powers right next to me.  I can have the courage to act.  And sometimes it doesn't have to be a big action can be a little teeny baby step. That's the other thing that I want to talk about willingness.  I am not committing to be abstinent for the rest of my life.  I can't.  But I can take a baby step to be abstinent for the next four hours.  Or sometimes for the next five minutes.  Or sometimes Just In This Moment.  So a lot of willingness for me besides courage and acting as if comes with experimentation what experiment what small experiment am I willing to run to be able to move into the next phase the next few minutes of my life, sometimes they're bigger experiments, but I try and keep my experiments kind of small because otherwise they feel like I'm jumping over a big wide Chasm and I might fall into the blackness.  it's scary and I've been in program long enough that I know that Chasm is a figment of my imagination in my eyes thinking thinking but  still feels that way sometimes so I try and take a little baby experiments along the way.  And it's okay.  That I that I take these experiments even though I'm they're unfamiliar and I'm uncomfortable. This program doesn't guarantee us to be comfortable all the time.  Are my oh my God. Okay, I'll speed up. Okay, my my  experience as an addict is I want to be comfortable all the time right all the time. That's my experience. And it's okay. I want that's that's that's the way my brain circuitry is wired. I do not want to be uncomfortable. But I know that some discomfort helps me grow and I know I won't die from it.  It's really important. Sometimes I feel physically hungry in this program.  I didn't before I made sure I didn't before.  And I'm able to feel the physical hunger M gu able to go God. My body's working like it's supposed to yay God. I'm actually I'm actually eating as much as my body needs and now my body's telling me I need more fantastic. That's a that's a huge. There's a huge gift of gratitude in that for me.  You know a we are given no diets, but we are shown a program of recovery that IT addresses the emotional spiritual and spiritual nature of our program in addition to the physical. So I co a as a three-prong stool.  I can't just focus on the physical. Sometimes it feels kind of cool when I'm you know, when I when I losing weight, so it feels kind of great but I know that's that's false because if I just focus on the physical it's not going to hold up and not going to be able to sustain myself. So the way I can sustain myself is working the steps.  And keeping my food plan and recognizing that there are emotional components to my recovery their physical components to my recovery and their spiritual components to my recovery, and they all need to be worked and it and it's transformative. This program gives me so much. I mean I've had years of therapy this program is giving me things with therapy has never been able to give me and it's free, but it requires action and it requires willingness.  and  I've seen it work.  So it also I also have hope because I know it works and I've seen it work in myself, and I've seen it work in others.  None of us can follow this way of life perfectly, but we find that our success and recovery and our freedom from food Obsession or in direct proportion to how sincerely we try to live in this manner.  So I use some tools around for sustainability progress, not perfection.  Huge doses of self-compassion because my my addictive nature my disease wants to beat the crap out of myself.  So I this program is taught me I had some amazing sponsors that taught me self-compassion.  And a loving Embrace when I came into the program I couldn't look at myself in the mirror without cringing.  And through lots of work and program work. I can look in themself in my in the mirror and most times I can say. I love you amazing.  It's a gift. I can't it's a miracle kind of.  Taking step 3 shows our willingness to live by God's will one day at a time. So one day at a time is what I truly have. I cannot relive the past nor can I live in the future?  The now is what I have and for me the now is like a bombing Salve because if I think about just now, how am I feeling just in this moment? I'm actually pretty good. I have lots of things going on in my life. There's some health problems for with my kids Sig significant ones, but for right now, I'm okay and I can be the best. I can be by staying in the moment.  Many of us is found have found that working the 12 Steps in applying them in our lives has helped us to better understand God's will having this willingness to work the steps. We do not let any doubt or confusion. We may still have keep us from acting we concentrate on whomever or whatever. We think God might be and we say out loud in words of her own choosing that we will now turn our will and our lives over to a higher power holding nothing back when we say our personal prayer asking for help.  Minute we have made the key life-changing decision that will lead us to recovery. We have taken the third step. So what is my what is my prayer and this prayer is actually I alluded to in the beginning of the share the serenity prayer and the Serenity Prayer is God grant me the serenity to accept the things that I can that I cannot change the courage to change the things that I can and the wisdom to know the difference.  Since thy will be done and this is a sustaining prayer. I can say it in any moment. I can say it to myself quietly. I can say it I can verbalize it. I can I can get on my knees and I can say it I can say it on the bus. This is a really powerful prayer and it helps keep me in alignment with my heart power. So that's all the that's all the time that that I have. I really appreciate the opportunity to  share. Thank you.
Welcome to First and 15 the show that takes you around the UK flag football team sponsored by new Oleg your customized sportswear supplier preview and review its weak ones all done.  Here with Steve Pablo and Connor. So let's have a quick look through a common which division this one is the one with the the London smoke at the top of it. They had a great game. They were destroying teams all over the place. So a quick look at their scores if I can find them. I know that they gave us a good show fin. They be are 60 points to 12 6212 on that one. They beat the late and steam 28 to 7. Never beat the Titans Atlas as well tightens up missing I mean  - we played them. They're very they've used a lot of the youth Squad in this one from the which is not a bad thing for them as their I didn't know about to head off to the national championships again.  But you can see like they've got a lot of energy as they will run around throughout that what was a stupidly hot day. I think we did a commentary and it was 27 degrees and 20 degrees Yeah. It's it was a real big Heat Wave you're not big but I mean Frost rich people are not used to it. Anything over like 10 degrees is a heat wave in England, sir.  Bun on the other side of that North hands Phantoms just dropped down from the Premiership and they lost all four games.  I said I said last week that they're baffled record, which was we was going 12 isn't good, but it's come from a Premier League Division. So you got a suit look as if they're competitive team who did the Phantom's play very loud. What were their results? Who are they against help the teams are against Innocents to Nottingham. So obviously that's one of the weak teams in there because they're caught about supporting and their safety is not much better on me. That's just something real.  It's going to be a rich Grace just like this is this is proper an edge band to this is Nottingham not suppose 1 2013 and knotting played. I think they played pretty well the rest of the way didn't they so that there are good side. Obviously, they lost to the raccoons. God say we went in there expecting to be in a tough tough game and it started out that way I didn't then we just seem to be able to handle them and it's over then of this players missing or what you never know. They lost.  It was 24/7. They lost to the new Boys The Neptunes 2715. And where's the other one there? They lost to the Sharks 2612 so not all right. So when they lost to us and the Neptunes that's division one so, you know, they have to stop down but is that yeah that maybe they're going to struggle next season when they're in actual buffer division one. I don't know got figures with our universe, you know.  Teams, you know some teams have don't have other players. Some people example was to about their own with the Longhorns how their Star Quarterback wasn't there these kind of player gets happen in Outlaw because course Bob sees is done is the summer people going away. This could be another one of those teams. Maybe they didn't have a full team. Maybe they weren't full strength, maybe Focus up taking a phone call during the podcast and it's just yeah, I think I think we should still be optimistic for the Phantom's because they could come into this next game we  Before the players ready to go. I'm not saying that the Phantom's are going to go off and lose win every single game what lose everything again and move up one step into Ninth Place in this Division and it's the Cheltenham Neptune's I hear you. Okay? No, no good after you on my always take it take it away. I was talking about one of their players. But only one of them this is what I said to them. I have got no issue with the rest of their players.  I've got issues with pot right now is he's trying to sort out his business in the background, but I've got no issue with the rest of the options. They are a nice guy nice bunch of guys that learning the game there are new team but you know, that's that's just it was just that one guy and yeah, he as far as I know he's not coming back.  He's is next week. After that. He is a product of course University so he could be fully committed to contact following, you know, we're following from when the season starts. We don't know where he's going to be the rest of the guys are this very young team is still learning the game and I think that, you know teams in this they do have a small sweet to look at these teams who are onager who are just starting.  Teams, like of course naturally is an opportunity. I've started like the quaint Gators. These teams are sort of showing up quite recently. I think that the current teams and the veteran teams have the responsibility to really show these guys how the league is run stuff. Yeah. It's one guy, but I think as a whole every team in the league can really help teams like the Neptunes and these newer teams Yammer. I agree with that one. So I mean they had a one-in-three day as their own.  Rumors against North and Phantoms, but they they had the Bears they lost 42 6. They had steam they lost twenty nine to twelve and there is one more somewhere and they lost the Longhorns 3226. So apart from the Bears game. It was quite a close day for them again. We'll move to eighth place. It's Lincoln Longhorns. Same same results one and two  their winning ways against the Neptunes  They lost quite heavily to the steam 31:6. Yeah, that's the sperm. I did mention earlier about literally walked free for me to go that teams in Outlaw do tend to be missing planes. This is another one of those they didn't have their starting quarterback, but with despite, you know, missing a key player qvb position. They show signs of optimism. They showed a strong running game.  And also still show a strong defense, so when they do have more their players around and you know, they have those players who might be more experienced around the game coming in.  I think that the second week of our second game we go out look to be quite interested for that's what that we said pandas page long bones. I think we were quite fortunate to you know, it's not nice to say. Oh we were quite fortunate that that guy was in here, but those are kind of fact is you look into when playing games and after you think that the teams that they are against next week have to be cautious of this team because they're not the team that we saw him leave.  Well, they had sir Phil step in at quarterback for this one. And from what I heard Cameron Stewart will be back is he so that will be taking them from a new team a rookie team as with a different quarterback and they've now going to go back to their not serve rookie team because have now finished their first season with their starting quarterback, and so I do think that they're they're one and two record is going to improve quite well for them. Enjoy a phone call call.  Perfect. Anyway the coming after after Longhorns, so we've got Sharks next again one and two it's a few wins here and there can change this group Master because it's the opening day. Yeah, they're one win if I try and find it now.  They lost to the Titans Atlas twenty five six. Okay, that's times out this good. There are team that you lose hearing. Okay, you know, there are there are competitive team and they beat the Phantom's. Yeah, and then lost to the Bears.  I'm Gonna Leave You talk about the Bears later on when it comes to it because I know you love to talk about the Bears. So from that I was I did say that I reckon that they could go on to win the play. I think there's so much chance to I think that like like you said week one. We don't know where we are. We found no team knows where they could really be looking up from just three games.  But is it really table now and go it all makes sense? And this is how well everyone's going to work out apart from smoke and the smoke right away or that but yeah in sixth place we have the raccoons one and two-day we beat the Phantom's we lost a Titan doubtless, and we would the played another game later on in fifth place.  Don't talk about your game week. No, I mean we won we lost to its that's all we really need to talk about. If you want to mention anything, I'll leave you to it. Well, I think I'm guessing we're going to do a quick game review after but following the raccoons guesses the pandas.  Honestly, I think that that when we looked at the first three games of felt was saw the figure looking at you know, we looked at smoke and we thought we have a chance. I don't remember saying we're going to be of I know you did say that you were going to be the fan you were going to beat the smoke in the game day. I need to look back. Its I need this see this be recorded. I mean, did you beat the smoke? No? No, what was the score in the Smoke going? I don't know but it was 6212. It was a close one for you.  Close. Yeah, I mean I've ordered an out for other people think that's what yeah, is that enough? So many points you it was very generous everything that I think on the day of Route Seven touchdowns and two picks both would pick sixes. So if anyone, you know wants me to throw down with pick six and they came days also do weddings and funerals. I can throw a pick sixes at any events you need but I mean you throw it inside the loss. There were two wins. What is the real cause of that coming in for the next couple of game days or they still sticking with you? What do you think? Mark is leaving you guys?  Two weeks. That's not the game against rugby, which was interesting. It was like we played on her it was Australian Rules Football wasn't it? Let's be honest and played on a pitch as big as the NC G rated at the pitch. And at one point before they would have looked over and when does this look like an uproar pitch and they somehow both of them?  Above All Gods as responsible as your guy and saying yeah, that seems right at 27 degree heat. I've never seen a picture as big as that. It was at least 30 yards wide at least of the IRC from Julia contact pictures, which I think play on the same as senior. It was flag. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but you're right. I mean it's like the over there were the UFL pitches because of the the Restriction they've got on the field size are slightly smaller than the official regulations and things you have four pictures will call them we don't mention back.  This one. This is our countdown to mention our lot of client services in this as well. I don't know. We'll see this way. We got sponsored by you that because half the players run to get a taxi from the Huddle to the the wide receiver certainly were running D was like 20 seconds to get to the air to the wide receiver. Who is this six of you is you had your son playing from us people. We had a seven players that day in 27 minutes. Yeah. Well skived it was  On the normal pictures, we played on a 50-yard from End Zone to end zone. Yeah, I do think that it was 50 yards from The End Zone to halfway on this Edge know that it was 40 yards. It look like the pitch that the raccoons measured out for their game. They speak. Well, we have like one half of the pitch was an extra ten yards longer. This is so that it was an echo through it like miles. It would have gone out the back of a four pitch.  She was killed. Yeah, just show it. I just just show you on it because it was done by children through it as like in a company would be like a competition for our fucking turd and it's still dammit buttons by miles on it was still like 10 yards short of the end zone when he when he caught it when you see like the the kicking of so if you continue through from the halfway line for the openings for oh laughs it didn't he didn't he didn't say has to come out of the end zone to catch the ball. Yeah, and that's where your Runners got like half.  Way, they had stopped and had a drink and then carried on there was well, I mean we were quite fortunate in terms of drinks because you generously gave us our date Gatorade which I mean I didn't work did it well, no still be something about it was fine. And I think that shows that you know, sometimes you can't take treats from strangers, but I wouldn't advise it but I've still got us I've still got 22 bottles in my car. When did when did they explain Mark? Yeah. And what's the date? Well, what's what month is it?  Nicki Minaj has a nice Vibe was in this Gatorade, but regardless we didn't care because we're on a pitch which would rival a regular Premier League soccer pitch was but fair play to the other committee for letting us play on it and just say yeah, okay, whatever that you know, you guys agree to this you guys been to resolve restauran game as well. Yeah. That was a pretty what kind of you resta. So yeah, I'm pretty sure is boss. I was wanting to step in when they choose.  Country referees are both wearing pandas jerseys, but there was no contracts and that's part of why we did it was we knew we knew we all know each other and we knew it wasn't the game to finish no go home. Yeah, but we didn't want to finish on a hitch. No, that was a pass interference the was on. Oh Tyler be a cosine T sine T it on himself.  Sorry, I think it was no Shay Shay. Yeah, I'm saving for you and overthrew it obvious oranges for a flower crown himself. And yeah, so I was a farmer to end on and often they had a good day as well as us was the latest Steam. Yeah 2 and 1 on the day so could look for their results. Now, they lost to the Smoke which is not a bad thing to really have they beat the Longhorns 31-6 and  The Neptunes 2912, I mean they finished second in the Seb for that was there before division? Yeah, they had a great season all throughout we did the commentary for the late and steam link Longhorns game, which was a great game to watch I was a kid and yeah, it was it was a good fun thing to call it as well. They were on the sidelines talking to us throughout the throughout the game. Yeah, they friendly guys we have some real talent on that field as well.  He showed their standings in the SCBA and their performance over to Outlaw loss against smoke. I mean, that's just that's going to be a thing that every time to get a look at setting go. Oh smoke maybe teams online bears and many times. I just might be a bit more optimistic, but you look at that smoke team, you do finger else like, you know, you just think I think that they've brought a lot of their Premiership one. I found one which one's the Premiership smoke or Flash, but I think it's more Premiership than division one.  So alongside the loss to the smoke and the win against the Longhorns if I'm not wrong was the other result that they had they beat the Neptunes being that she's okay. That's which is only just that wasn't 2912 2632. It's done are 29 times.  Bipartisan cars reading glasses on today. I'm also reading them but the insert case of the moment Titans Atlas two and one there. They played the Sharks 25:6 win for them. They beat us 3812 their only loss against the smoke which is yeah. That's that's like a Christian go to church on Sunday. We're going to be seeing that a lot. I mean I was about to ask if there's any team that's going to beat the smoke. Who's it going to be a my my opinion was going to be  Titans out us I mean from its Omar division, that's that's who I thought was going to be and I've just seen that they've lost them as well.  I think the Bears are a currently in second place are at decent day undefeated didn't sections 42-6, which is again after that. What about the strongest teams that they would have been noticing that was an issue that was strong. But like what teams did they play that we might be looking thinking? Oh, that's a surprise. I mean, they beat the Sharks the sharks are decent team. They just Division 1 1 division one playoff you say that I would be like this again was a  The best ones 3212 so wasn't you know that's the kind of thing you think you think okay, so they it wasn't like I want to get it was convincing win and was the other one no times Phantoms. 22:13 Bears win again is a team that are called Street. Yeah. So there's your dunno what very what we're seeing at. They've had a nice going week one week. I think they had the easier fixtures. They've had and but then yeah, you have to look at the top and it's smoke / flash 309  - where they 28-7 against the steam Dave 131 gets pandas getting out there. And is that I thought you said sure it's on said we're going I see I see I need to hear this try and find this as from somewhere cause I need to try and he's also did you see when you played it with it with a fast Woody efficient with a well drilled it. Was there anything that sort of really sensitive? I think it was a number 5 of The Emoji wide receiver gloves.  It's that we think that is one hell of a player. It was a cube as well. I think his GB gold don't I don't hold me up to that thing. Someone said that you know, he had the swag for flag. He really did have everything about it and he did get my gamely Pick 6. He was a real but just I had the chance to go on defense in that game and even everything's quite a lot from what I can see when I know if he was on defense. Yeah.  But this guy would just you'd be you know, a few meet send me away from you. You think I've got that let's go and so far from you just left look at a lot of yeah. Yeah. It's such an army had the talent around him. Goodbye to you guys as well. You know that they just they played the game. They had fun with it. Definitely a hot favourite for taking the whole thing. Really they were really strong team. Obviously a  you guys  because I'm pretty sure you said that you were going to win the whole thing as well. I said that we were going to get my order I said that I said that the shocks are going to be us in the place. You make yourself up now. And of course here I said trucks are going to win the plate against us because I was going to take bribes. I mean, I'm not going to I haven't always he's you say your table where he gets all the even if you're right, even if you're right. It's twisting because apparently he will never give you a forecast on anything controversial and he'll never mention whether or not  Yeah, maybe no controversy on my side. But I'm the one who's got a lawsuit against me for one thing. Yeah, but you can actually say anything wrong by so found out. Yeah, I've got like one of the Neptune's players have to me that I've got one of the Bears payers is after me. We had the ties up this on your one point. I think last week. You never know what you're going to get with the Titans.  Did you yeah, you've seen the movie Quan now and what you do, you know what you're going to get with them now. Yeah, we're gonna get lost. It's a bit like people tend to underestimate the cougar ladies. We know what everyone else knows what the atlas were going to bring as and you did because what is what are you saying? We knew exactly what I was saying about the title for clicks.  So this is if people want to send me messages saying I'm gonna go to like a military. That means they're listening. That's all I was only it's for clicks. It's for nothing else. So what I said about the Titans was that they have two teams. It depends on how they're going to spread it.  That was all I was saying is the fact that every year they split it the same way as they did this time didn't bear in your thinking you just went for I don't know how they do it. I wasn't doing a podcast or season. I didn't drink it when you get the sorted had the strongest team. They have a great team in Prometheus and they have a stronger core team which they use. I mean you talk about being used players a lot of the graduated from youth  And can I think someone's I Duel at the moment die, but they they are that's they're stronger stronger side. Anyway was happening. So I have a quick look at the upcoming fixtures. I do not see the smoke losing this week. They've got the Longhorns because they've had the next things were recording this but yeah, they've got the Longhorns. They've got the next jeans and they've got the raccoons. I don't see any of those guys being the one tearing Coons are going to lose that I will say that they are low just because you're not there.  I'm not saying I'm not saying that I don't think that there is going to be any team in this entire division. That will be the smoke unless are running games going to get a real good work out of the things we might be able to grind it up for OneDrive each else are people that show coming back because let's be honest at the moment. So so shads might be a bit different next season and he's still battling with a few knocks and things like that that don't  We think he might actually but generally every time we've been out of college you won't see them of this year, which is what which one we got to replace in Coventry. Most of we did quite well by it because you had seven players. Who are you looking to be back for week 2  Well, I'll be away for the next reason people your that's you losing more people. So that takes well that takes us down to five because there was me and my son was about this pretty good, which is some to be fair got his first cap. Yeah, you played it smart like a contact they're going straight for the sun goes down there. We got first down and went straight out. So then I think we may be gaining a few of our more defensive players back which will help us out a lot in rotation as well and obviously  It's just the depth with flag. Everyone plays every both sides of the ball apart from me, you know, so it's going to help you out. Even if it's just like one player a defensive player comes on for a couple of plays as like a wide receiver or something just to give one of your other receivers a break. Yeah, just and some shade or a drink or anything else about the Gatorade. Yeah. Just yeah, they Gatorade was a godsend that at one point in 2024. Yeah right about there. Yeah. You have to hit you up for that next.  Just next time I'm gonna be there next week. Look at it over think it off a degrees could do some out-of-date chemical War so I might have to take you up on that if anybody else wants some let me know I can I can make like a range of delivery at the start. I'm out. I won't be able to turn up with the for the game. But that's it. Oh, yeah, it's supposed to get sponsored by out-of-date products sponsored by it works is which are three years old. So after that it was it was a nice drink though. It wasn't so let's have a quick look at the Pod will  You on the spot on this one. The raccoons got the Neptunes the steam the Longhorns and the smoke is going to be a bit of a che tank as a close team Shay's wound up before we know the steam. They're going to go all out to be as because che che very very quiet and sweet with me. I've got to say thinking of playing a lot of games because even even we commented that we are cleared from him, and he certainly didn't insult anyone they didn't take  You out early for once. He didn't even know it's funny. It's funny because I don't have any other teams out that I mean, we don't we love the I fell we were in there from the minute. We knew it was being played again this season and yet we get to it and we've just struggled to get players together to get a strong stronger squat. So there's a little bit for us is who will get on the next game daming as you said yourself, you might have six players again, it could be really tight.  Swing sobs lower is the the hot weather of did you help us at all? Because we were struck down unlikely to two of the three games. I've played every snap and one of them that one driver. I think I took off and it was a bit hard there and I think that's what took count of a couple of players on the last game. That was so what's a movement. That's what's your prediction for the the raccoons record in you got four games. My prediction is you won't be there.  Well, that's that's a very bold predictions bold. Neptune. Steam will go Longhorns right thing. I run three or four games. Yeah, we won't turn up the for that one your turn corner. So this is the Pounders. So just cause you've got teams Titans Atlas sharks. Okay Bears Phantoms.  See, I'm there's a lot of his at like I said, you know, you never know. You never know what you gonna get week in week out because some people might get some people have a song cue bass player luxury over there. I think I hope but some people might some people might have their star receiver gone, you know, some people might be aware holiday contains one of their Star Quarterback going. Yeah. So forth has perspective. I see if we go out to and to I'll be content if we go out three one. I'll be happy.  $4 drinks on me. I think that's best time to say if but Blossom saying if we do drinks are on me at Hebrews because that would be a great result three-on-one like that. I'd be happy with two and two are black. Okay, that's that's a strong day out. I feel like being disappointed with anything under to and I mean, you're about starting quarterback. You think the Bears will bring their starting quarterback or to think that stick with Richard. You tell me you're the one who hates him. I don't hate you.  I know it probably doesn't if you don't know it doesn't sound so good does it but it is it is or banter and he started it really did he learned he was just trying to wind you up? Yeah. I say Neal famous money and we'll put 50 on here. And I don't think he really meant it because Dad for those who have no idea what the hell is going on between yeah, it definitely seems heated and it's not it really isn't as its he's a great guy. He's a good coach as well. And as he proved he's actually stepped in at quarterback there and done a solid job last week and he plays pretty well. That's a  Safety as well, isn't it what we're looking at in that thing. So for this River be Exile about it game of the game week from that. We think we're the most hotly contested one because there's a lot of games where we're looking at say the position one of this early table against position term. We've got Titans out in this first of bears, which is basically two against three then yeah, then there's nothing else is my question Done Yet Bears versus Titan Atlas probably the game of the Exile But whichever  It's getting the game of that. It's the game that week for this one from the standings point of view. And I think that would have looked like a real party contested game. So yeah, I've always said it would have been interesting to watch. I've got the I've got earlier the Titans to win that one there. All right. Now you've started to suck up to him and I've got nothing against tightens itself. I can't give away everything kind of like because otherwise it is I'll get ya a true nature.  I think group chats and chats and can't keep track of what he doesn't doesn't know I think is the problem is also a flag. I mean if people want the clicks if I start giving away all the secrets, I've got the Bill Belichick's like football. It's never going to happen cheated all the time. So we'll move on to division starting on the bottom Wolfson IV rattlesnakes a team that I'd never heard of before. This is the new team, isn't it? They're very fresh out the  Open web you want to quit. I don't know come fresh out of the horse and the desert probably other snakes. Well, they did not have there's no other first first good day. They lost three.  They played the warrant Revolution, which was never going to be an easy game. They lost thought you one-nil. Yeah, they play the gwent Gators. Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it who they see the Gators 141 six, they scored so into into games there there. They've got an 82 points conceded six scored the final game or the other game they played I was looking at a minute ago.  They don't how much thought that's it.  46 7  I've got I couldn't find on the street then 46 7, so that's a hundred and twenty points conceded in in three games.  Over there a duty you're hot you just say just point it out. Hey, you know, we just got one in our school and you've just suddenly died of rocked it there a new team and I just hope that it doesn't really discouraging because you know quite a few teams. They were good enough I dare you anyway, so I thought  Second score line is no, it's me laughter. I don't know what part is finding so funny here. It's got me good, you know anything about bugs you may have heard some more. I mean, so the Bronx other people are they have they come as different, you know, they've merged as a team or other new team should there are states. I've got no idea I've got I've liked the page on Facebook and that's about it. That's your all I see on there is we have training this time. So there's no mysterious beings. Yeah. There's no big names popping in and saying, you know, that's going to help these guys out a bit like  Lat Lincoln should have been this year. They're rookies really say well, they turned up this scored some points. Yeah, they turned up that's better than some teams will do flights. I mean Bedford you could think of the Panthers were starting early it took us a long time to go for a swim. So I hope it doesn't discourage them Warrington and one of the favorites when they I'll definitely what it would have been one of the favorites Premiership team who's good and keep getting stronger and stronger and Gwen.  This is actually a really good day than that. Yeah. Yeah that they once we lost one maybe it just got unlucky and plate probably the hardest bit of their schedule as you said before it's hard to tell it's hard to tell because you know, you haven't had lost Player 1 I believe in this division. We only play for months. So you really want until the final week when you look back and think okay. So these are the playoff standings. This is walking by happen. So who's the head of the rattlesnakes another snake? We've got the Sheffield Vipers.  Again, Owen three thought it was as in the windscreen wipers and you were to say in French for just ignore it. It will go away eventually.  Voices when screen Focus anyway it was appalling this is the stuff I have to put up with every single train everything good very good team. So that's quite a surprise. I mean they've come to Cooter's lost 3219, but the Cougars are decent Sports play against they lost the the Gunslingers quite heavily 61 13. No shame in that and  Bedford 22:6. So again, they just play through every they yeah, they they had a rough start to ofl fixtures and Prometheus.  Again, oh and three this is obviously that the way they were saying it's not you have rinse and repeat it. Yeah, they played they paid Warrington. Okay, the pay the books Wolves and the northern Longhorns.  But yeah, they lost all three.  Maybe they're going to have like a better fixture list for the second game day. I didn't they had the easier games than the Vipers and the rattlesnakes.  When you look at the standings at the moment, but they couldn't quite manage it a win on that one books Williams managed one win. They lost as a cougar seniors 32 now, they they beat the Prometheus one. That was their only win and they lost to the Gators 19. Now. What was the Prometheus cool?  Which one in a beat the Prometheus? What did they say? What was the school that was lost on the sheet now?  26 626 is not as they've got a few points up there. I just wondering if it's going to be one of these sort of they won six nail or something like that because they didn't score a lot of points. When you score any points the other two games against what we think might be some quite strong teams, maybe offensively they've got a bit of work to do that. We will move into sixth place, which is I know it's only first week and things are but Bedford are currently in sixth place, but what they're really he did lose his place for Play Store.  K12 lost to okay who are their two losses walk when you see when did really well didn't I when they did there is a great. Yeah 34:6 the beat the beat the Vipers.  They beat the rattlesnakes. Okay, and then lost to the Gunslingers 2039. Okay, so I'll send you got okay that's doesn't decrease work went in the bathroom of the I know we could go out where they experienced players because of how many Wells teams are at the moment and they keep moving people around and because obviously they can all get to most of the areas and where I was anyway.  Dale Davis who used to be the Celts quarterback before they folded. He's now one of the the Gators head coaches also runs one of the other podcast for me. He will be covering the week two and week three live commentary duties. So you have a bit of an international flavor as we bring in Wales. No, he'll be there we talked about it and then him and I think we're going for northants Titans Atlas against  Tell him Neptune's is the game. I think we've picked to cover should be a good one. Yes a bit. They do have some experienced players. I think they picked up a few of the Celts. Well, see when they folded and they were good soften. So yeah, they've they've got some decent players and they've got grass now to make a paper quo cannot so make a team run. So you're not really a rookie team. Are they? No? No, they're not Lincoln so both because I mean we're back up so they haven't  Today yet to play against the likes of the Cougars and the likes of Revolution. I've always do you could you see Blackhawks beating the Cougars or the revolution? Yes, which I've done it before and it certainly beat the Cougars before we will return to your scheduled programming shortly or we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. So in fifth place is the northern Longhorns that see this is a team that's going to be a weird one for anybody.  They are a mixture of Cavaliers roosters. And any other team that wasn't going to make it down as a whole team Rudy again has put one together and you know, they had a great first day.  Oh, yeah, I've just said that I looked at it and realized 1 1 and 1 but you know, they played good it's not bad. They beat the Prometheus and I read their report. They had fun didn't certainly read their face book writer. So I read there's and some oh jeez the other day and they certainly enjoy themselves. It sounds like they were in the game so that they beat the Prometheus.  The one loss was against the Cougars and they lost 1413.  Which is a decent result and they did exactly the same as we did in bafa and Drew with the Gunslingers 3939. That's a good that would have been a good game. I mean if anybody your fault if you can I think they've got their own page on Facebook now, so if you can find their page and read the report on that one and there was pick sixes to end the game and it was it would have been a great game to watch. Yes. That's true. Classic. I think Rudy got a pick six and was spinning around to try and  Into the end zone and made it the whole way. So, you know, it was a good game for everybody on that one.  But yeah it there are difficult team to really look at and manage because no one knows who they've got and a few games to play left and a few games to play next few big teams. She's more teams. I think if they come out of this above me table, I've been that's a Justified position. I reckon if you look at the teams that are there the likes of all the teams that were going to mention soon Gunslingers cougars Revolution to  You know possibly contained in to be within those teams will be a good place. That's fair, isn't it? There's some very strong teams in that Division and also stronger efficient and that's when someone playing in the other division. Yeah, you look at that and you think there are three or four teams in there that I would rather not play as oh definitely the top of the table is that top for he's pretty damn good. That's yeah. That's a real powerful division.  so whether a quick look at this one Warren Revolution did very well last season there were I think there are Premiership team Coventry cougars have just been promoted against their will  And they got promoted it was their own fault for winning the league and then to the throne some games. Well, I think that we would have from games. No one wanted to go up in that yet, but they were trying to throw the final game which would have been at the playoffs. They were built to the point. Yes the team for our first and then the Gunslingers who won division one on their side and then came second in the vision one playoff and there's the Gunslingers figured to have they didn't have the strongest side either. It's a very good team, but they've got a couple more coming back.  From what? I saw Stephen wasn't that was easy this time. Is that right? It's certainly another they've got a couple of players coming back again next next game as well. So they'll go even stronger moving. So we look at how could the Gators again a great game for them three on one? Yeah beat the Blackhawks be the rattlesnakes lost to the revolution which isn't really that bad and then beat the wolves that again they were I think they came second or third in their division.  Which for their first team first year? Sorry that yeah, there was a good outlook for them.  Gunslingers on their homepage on the home turf, sorry two and one  and there anyone with their only one was the draw against the are the Northern on Horns. So they got the Cougars came in second with a 3-0 day and the revolutions free and oh, yeah who wins against the Gunslinger not the biggest team did that day so I couldn't run tears from The Drew the Longhorns the beat the Viper 61 13. Okay, and the beat Bedford  A sin against black folks have said a team that you know them or not the best start to the season but it's a respectable team. Once again, this can be one of those teams. We won't really know where they stand on the top of that table until they play give it a go because of Revolution and I think that's goes for all of those top three teams really googors at three-and-oh Revolution at fear. No and did Evil those teams play against a top 40 did it any of those teams? I don't think any of  the top four played each other. That's what a shake down a bit. Maybe that's it. We'll see ya when we start to see some more competition between those top four when we start to see a goose versus Gunslingers or Gators versus Google's or a revolution versus calcium. So we start seeing those kind of changes we would start to get a good idea of who should be wearing the table until then. It's anyone's game and we're to quit prediction for the top of the league which for the for the other division which is pretty much guaranteed to be London smoke. Yeah.  After what you've seen so far, who do you think is going to win this division? I'm sticking with what Revolution I'm back in them water wave in this out or I'm back from them every step of the way and I think they're going to I can't remember who I said, I think I said that the Gunslingers are going to win this one. You know, I even though they drew one. I still think they're going to be  top of this to this side of the table pod. You want to yeah, we like to Let It Go Gunslingers mainly because notice back to the revolution. I don't really know them. I've never actually played I wasn't there when you play them year or so ago, and I just know, you know, pretty much everyone on the Gunslingers from the Titans days and there's some Talent now, they've also got a pretty good quarterback.  It's a you say that and look at me here with a with a little grin on your face in front of us. You should have been playing for the records. But now I know I you know, I know them and they really do have some talents and I'll just go on the fact that I know them. I know what they're capable often Sparrow. I think I think they'll top it I would have had this Vision in seeing that wherever team finishes first in that division could possibly win it all and become the new favorite going into the playoff picture or are we not giving or not? I say, oh no not given smoke the respect they deserve just because they're in  Arguably a division of last competition. I don't think smoker definitely in the contention. I think that a competition amongst that division that these Gunslingers cougars Revolution and arts educators are still in that competition. I think that the team in that division the most of the more competitive division who are vicious person that whether it be revolution organ singers,  I just think that they will have nothing momentum to win it all with no disrespect to the smoking smoking pot make the final but the competition and just you know, the amount of challenges in that table surpass the other division so to speak if you know, I'm trying to say that basically you've got your smoker pain a bunch of pansies Patsy's or rolling over bit like the AFC East so they're not being  Challenge they're not sharpening themselves because they the others are beating up on each other and therefore they're going to raise their games nearly Zionism. I'm saying that there's more competition. Yes, and that's are ready. They're more ready. We look at smoking we say they're going to be every single team that you know, including things like there's where as we look at this one and there are three or four games in there that we think this could go this way or that way the smoke was still in its use it because we need a prediction last week's you're saying so go ahead and give you the other giving you smoke.  Before I got smart, I'm keeping and flush. I'm keeping I'm keeping Revolution. You said you weren't sure you pick the last week. I can't who I picked but go from this Division. I would say the Gunslingers just seconds 50 seconds things lots of it the smoker smoker can everyone which one it was but it did the one thing that Gunslingers have going for them and at this actually infirmities to a degree if they get there, you never know. It might be bad weather and we difficult thing. They've got the Flyers.  Likely to turn up London had you suspect only needs a tough week or a problem and people traveling what 60 70 miles up from there. And that might be the difference at the end of it, you know bad day A bad weather. Somebody get started. I know he's often the way with some of these things isn't it? But you never quite know what teams can turn and it's proved it with the raccoons. We six seven players and it'll be a different six seven players next time that might be the thing is so with that being said we've talked about how these  before I played against each other or even against each other in week two having a quick look at the scores after that the fixtures coming up the Cougars will pay the revolution that's going to be a good one. The Cougars will play the Gators and the Gunslingers will play the revolution. So revolution of got tough day Revolution against the coup is and the Gunslingers but in the Cougars also got the Revolution and the Gators if you move down the table slightly, you've got the Gators of got the Blackhawks. I think I saw that one on there the Longhorns of  The Blackhawks as well. So you're sort of like looking at the top three are going to play each other and evening out those score sheets and then like the four five and six are going to be my right you finding out against each other. It's not beyond the Realms to see sort of even sixteens up there all potentially vying with each other and knocking each other out, but your I think Warrington and getting us to me and probably just a little bit above everyone else. I'm sorry. We're going to find out.  The next game we because I think the raccoons I got four as well and you have you won't even be there so I know I'll be listening.  No point in the day where it might be six o'clock in the morning. It might be three o'clock meeting. Everyone's having tea or something and suddenly it just go and like beat baby. I have some new every single conversation popular enough to be premiered in this group 7 group are millions more for this podcast markers, which he didn't bother reading. Yeah. Would you even bother reading nearly left me out in the dirt? I was trying I'm still trying to work out when you said it when it's 3 o'clock and everyone's having T. It is that your age  Because I couldn't think of what to say. I'm always in the work you seem to be three o'clock living on some kind of Life of three o'clock. Everyone's having two years five devices bed by T. Is this what is this? What what there's no messaging that you have into your be driving or doing something and suddenly just got a ping ping ping ping. I forgot to mute that one because usually every couple of days is a new group starts off with Marcus has added you to see if partners are applied.  Group after a while. I just make a new one with him in the and everyone else in it and just start the conversation off and he can't mute it quick enough. Yeah, we need to we need to solve that for like some get you some kind of help for that because that's not right. Well, I'm just going to make a group for by no Tuesday night training every time it's just you kind of go now because he likes it. I do it makes it makes you feel speaking of track groups. There is actually a few new ones. I've been in reasons we don't care.  Which are currently working on the coverage for the opal season, so hopefully we'll be covering opal as that comes up soon. Okay, maybe I do care a little bit. That's why I start these things. Yeah beer so we'll have the opal coverage coming up soon. But yeah comment with ofl week to as I said Dale Davis is hopefully going to be taking the mic and commenting on a few games. I don't know if you two will be involved in that one or if he's going to keep it strictly wealth one.  But yeah hope so. Hopefully we'll have a lot more live coverage from those ones and then it'll be finals day in a couple of weeks. We've got one or two a week two and three to finish off and this is where I'm hoping the weather is nice. It was last week. Not not not in Northampton. I'm hoping it rains every single time we can turn but wherever I am. I'm hoping it's wonderful and sunny there and I know it is because I've already checked the weather if we check the weather.  Defense plus I never sinned or yes, then then what is wise to River a problem? Because even if I go outside, it's still going to be nice. So thank you for listening and we'll see you out this episode find us on Facebook at first and 15 podcast. Give us a like to keep it with all our shows.

Hello and welcome to beyond the Turing test. My name is Art of author and my name is pronouncing and today's episode is on the topic of deconstructing deep fakes. So in order to deconstruct deep fakes first, we're going to need to understand what deep fakes actually are we'll start by talking about their origin why they're relevant and a high-level explanation of the technology that makes it possible. Then we'll dive into applications of deep fakes and examples of new stories were deep fakes are the center of the piece and then we'll About issues that arise from reading these new stories and seeing how prevalent deep fakes are in our society. Let's get started. So let's begin by analyzing where defects actually come from so at a very high level of a deep fake, it's just a portmanteau of deep learning and fake and as many things are it originates from the deep bowels of the internet known as Reddit in in about late 2017 and unsurprisingly was used for the purposes of pornography, but let's actually try and  take a second to understand what be fix really are and that is that it's a product of artificial intelligence or machine learning that merges replaces or superimposes content onto a video to make it appear to be authentic and that has the consequence of misleading viewers. I've done not on Facebook defines it at least and I'm pretty happy here on with that definition for the purposes of this podcast for now interesting because we will go on to talk about Facebook later. But in the meantime  Let's begin by diving into talk about why they're really relevant right now. So deep Pixar relevant right now because when you see a video on the internet the Deep faking technology has gotten so good that it's very hard to tell whether the video that you're looking at or the audio that you're hearing is the result of a deep faking algorithm, right and sometimes the technology might not be Advanced enough that it's likely that if you know what you're looking for. You can find certain tells in the video.  Oh that identify it as a deep thing. But if you don't have a trained eye and you don't know what you're looking for, but most importantly if you don't have a mindset to question the content that you're viewing, it's very unlikely that any red-flagged will start sparking off in your brain, which is why we feel this technology has the potential to be so dangerous exactly confirmation bias is a very real and powerful thing. And if you were to see a video of someone that you care about or someone that you really hate either way saying,  I think that confirms whether you're really like them or really hate them and it happens to be fake. You might not question it at first because that's what you want to hear. Absolutely correct proud of and I think it's especially important right now, you know heading into election season election fraud is a big conversation topic on the table and I think deep fixes definitely have a place at that table more specifically perhaps we should consider the influence of defects have and how they can sway public opinion as front of mention.  It can really help confirm your own biases and that can be a very slippery slope down to all sorts of echo Chambers forming we which we talked about extensively in the last episode in a different context. But but nonetheless we've seen how deep fakes can really alter a public perception very very quickly and that we feel is incredibly dangerous. So now that we've talked about a couple of reasons why deep fakes are relevant to society today. Let's talk a little bit about  How they are actually possible. So there are two main technological paradigms that allow deep fakes to be possible. One of them is a again or a generative adversarial Network Gan. It's a set of two neural networks that are trained on the same data. What that means is that let's say you want to create a really good picture of a dog. What you'll do is that you'll take a data set of dog images. You'll give it to both of these models the generative and the discriminative model the generative model will try to create  Date based on the data that had seen what a stereotypical dog would look like and it essentially tries to fool the discriminator model. So it's like two models with this really interesting interplay where one is trying to fool. The other ones trying to the generative model is trying to produce a picture and it's trying to get the discriminative model to take the bait and say that that produced images from the data set that they were actually trained on so this constant battle that they have allows the generator.  Become really really good at producing at producing images or producing data points that even the discriminator Train on the same data cannot tell are part of the original distribution or not in a nutshell. Essentially. You have two networks. They're both fighting against each other and as they fight against each other they're able to create better and better stereo types of the data that they're trained on.  Cool. So now that we've we've got a bit of an understanding of what a gun is at a high level. We can change course a little bit and begin to understand some of the news stories popping up right now. What are the concerns about deep fix in society and how is industry responding to it? I think a great starting point is read it because as we mentioned right it is where the whole phenomenon of defects actually began and what we see with Reddit is that they just recently a few  Ago put out a policy that said that you can't have any content at this point that impersonates an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner. Now, it's important to preface this that read it does have a lot of parody and satire on the website and they maintain that you will see that they aren't going to talk to parody or satire content and they'll take into account the context of any content however read it is clearly taking a stand a harsher stance against deep fakes.  And and we really feel that that's indicative of how industry is trying to nip this in the bud. But before it becomes too much of a systemic problem to deal with yeah, so in the same way that red it has stated a couple of policies about deep fakes and targeting deep fakes Facebook has done the same kind of thing. They're targeting videos that are manipulated to make it appear as if someone said words that they didn't actually say and they're specifically saying that according to this article from  PR the company will not allow videos on its site if they've either been edited or computer generated in ways that the average person couldn't detect and in the same caveat as Reddit, they're saying that Facebook isn't banning all deep big videos. It's still going to allow deep fakes to exist for parodies or satire. And of course, you know, if there are Clips where the words haven't, you know edited so that they're out of order or something like that or words that are cut out. They will allow those clips as well. So this  This kind of brings up the point. Like what is the actual difference between like parodies and satire and misinformation? Right? So both are added in Facebook. Well read it has said explicitly and I assume Facebook is intending to do the same thing where they intend to review things on a quote unquote like case-by-case basis or they'll review the context surrounding the issue, but it's a step in the right direction, but we just feel that there's so much room to toy with that that  Could it have could have unintended like externalities? Yeah, and you know when you're trying to determine the line between parodies and satire and misinformation. I think that's a pretty fine line to walk with because like, you know, some parodies are meant to some parodies are like and satire are essentially exaggeration and I could imagine that at some point exaggeration could be considered as it could be construed as misinformation in some way.  Of course, you know they are fundamentally different ideas. But if you're trying to make this algorithmic especially at the scale that Facebook operates, I can't imagine that there would be false positives that I can't imagine that there wouldn't be false positives and false negatives, you know and like errors made in both ways completely but I do feel like it is worth an acting this policy and then doing the damage control after words rather than having nothing there and just trying to stop  Finger as it comes in but you know deep fakes don't always have to be bad. We have come across a couple of examples where deep fakes can actually introduce some good into the world. So for example, there is a Canadian startup called lyrebird l yr. E bi R d-- they've partnered with the ALS Foundation to to create a project called project revoice. They're using generative AI just like we talked about in in Gans to create personalized see  synthetic voices for ALS sufferers who have lost the ability to speak. This is on an article in the next web.com and then they also have another are nguesso. Then there's a they talk about a project called Deep empathy that MIT and UNICEF were working on and the idea behind that is you use again again to create images that would show big cities. They could London and Tokyo to show what they would have looked like if they were bombed and the idea behind it. Is that maybe that can foster some kind of empathy  With those in Refugee crisis related countries and those were fleeing from war. So yeah idea. We do have a lot of Doom and Gloom to talk about deep fakes and they're certainly more coming up ahead. But we also think it's important to pause and reflect the Deep fakes inherently aren't a bad thing. Just some of the purposes that they could be used for could have malicious consequences and we feel that's a really important distinction to make because we have shown Let There are  Potential good uses for defects. I like the way that the author of this article puts it this is an article titled. The ethics of deep fakes aren't always black and white and the the author says that there are certain morally ambiguous examples of AI and the the author calls them gray fakes. I like that term a lot I do as well because you know, it's not always black and white, you know, what a surprise but you know, it is always important to note that like when I was mentioning earlier the falls  Positives and false negatives, I would hate for something like, you know project revoice. Like it may be a demonstration of project revoice where there's a person who has ALS they're using essentially what is an audio deep fake to talk again. And then also, you know, like images like the ones produced by Deep empathy being flagged I would hate for those to be, you know, taken down as a result of the policies. So that's a good point to make and I completely agree, you know, the these things should be out for people to see use and take advantage of  however, I would prefer that their flagged and then corrected later on then them going through the stream and all sorts of other malicious deep a Content also going through the stream. So perhaps that that's a bit of an impasse. We're at now. Let's take a look at some philosophical and ethical, you know, kind of quandaries that result as that come up as a result of deep fix. So, you know, let's say that there's a person who's disgruntled what Society  And there's a politician who they believe that you know, if the politician gets elected then their life will change for the worse or Society could change for the worse. They may think in their head that if I were to make a deep fake that presents some misinformation about this politician or about this person that would be better for society than actually let letting the politician proceed with their life and proceed with their views on Disturbed. It's kind of like a it's like a it.  Is a very complicated issue but we're trying to say is that there could be a person who believes that creating a deep fake of you know person a thinks that creating a deep fake of person B is ultimately better for society than letting person be exist as they are, right? Yeah, so and and we find that really dangerous. We think that it's a real Avenue for people disgruntled with Society to to exhibit kind of these these maniacal Tendencies because how  How angry do you have to be before you realize that if I make this video even though I know I'm doing something bad. If I if I use my gun at home to mess up this video perhaps I can prevent this person from ever getting into power and as a result Society will be better off. So one of the examples of how this can be quite threatening is if you consider, you know, someone makes a deep think about about a politician and even if one week two weeks later the media,  Comes out and says, hey, you know, we found out that this video is fake. It's not real. There's some group of people who didn't like that politician already who've just had all their biases falsely confirmed. You can then imagine that there could be a group of people who really really want to take down a certain politician or a certain person in power certain someone who has influence they could potentially plug into a website wait for any video relating to this person to be uploaded maybe a video of them speaking or like some sort of audio transcript and they could  Immediately produce a bunch of deep fakes disseminate a bunch of defects about this person and then pretty much like after a certain point. There are more deep fakes about this person than there are actual videos. And as soon as you do that deep fakes are no longer an outlier, they are more cohesive with the general population. So naturally a human will find it a lot harder to distinguish between what's real and what's fake. That's how you get in people's heads. And once you do that you completely you you gain a monopoly  Leon the mental playing field because news news agencies no longer only take the burden of only putting out verifiable Muse perhaps the burden will also fall to them on being able to distinguish between what's real and what's fake and I hate to bring it up but I feel it does have a role in the story quote unquote fake news is becoming part of our daily vocabulary. And if you already have people who don't believe  Certain new sources and only believe certain other news sources, even if you know, let's say CNN comes out and says that you know, we've we found out that this video is a fake perhaps some people just aren't going to believe it and they'll say no CNN themselves are the fake news. So then what is the fake who distinguishes that like that? That's his own like mental mental jungle gym in itself where and we don't have a clear cut path on who's going to be making  making the decisions about what's real. And what's fake does society can't do it as a whole because Society in general doesn't have the technical expertise to be able to do it. Perhaps maybe we can't rely on news organizations and will need to set up a government agency whose only job is to watch videos all day and figure out what's real. And what's fake not that that's really not feasible. It'll be an algorithm if anything but still the principal lie is that we don't have a clear indication.  who's going to take the burden of this this upcoming Behemoth, you know, this this issue really lends itself into legal territory almost too because if you make a video about someone else saying something that they never actually said that can be classified as defamation that could be classified as taking the person's character and manipulating people to think that their character is something that it actually may not be you could end up fooling a judge or  A jury actually using a deep fake, you know, let's say that there's a criminal who wants to get away with a particular crime. They could potentially present a deep faked video to the court and present it, you know, if it's convincing enough which the technology definitely could you know could could allow it to be you could get away with a lot of things but consider this idea on a different track, right? Let's say you have someone in power someone with influence and they get caught on video or audio doing something that they regret it is.  Too easy for them to just brush it off by saying use a deep thick. Oh, no. No, I never did that. That was that was a deep thick. No that wasn't really me at that point at that point. How can you really tell it doesn't really work for the people in power today, but in 20 30 years the people who are currently, you know, teenagers Generations Ed by the time that they take by the time that these people come into power there will be all sorts of videos.  Get majors of them doing questionable things throughout their childhood. We've grown up as a generation of everything. We do being documented in some form of the or the other and that just presents more opportunities for things that that people have done growing up in their childhood to be deep faked or to be allegedly passed off as being deep fakes, but as we know defects are multifaceted issue, so let's take a second to talk about another.  Of deep fix and this facet is the potential for synthetic Resurrection synthetic Resurrection is a way of using deep fakes to essentially reanimate someone who's not alive. And of course this probe this already like in itself leads to a lot of problems because you know, you could potentially get Michael. No, Michael Jordan's alive, Michael Michael Jackson Michael Jackson, you can potentially get Michael Jackson to promote some brand.  They like imagine Michael Jackson being reactivated from Death to promote some weak ass Brad like Bed Bath & Beyond that would be hilarious. But all jokes aside we've seen an example of I guess a really a really nice an example of what a deep fake was back in. I think it's 2012 at Coachella when they brought out hologram Tupac which at the time was groundbreaking but now that you think about it we've re and we reanimated Tupac's  With without his permission without his consent. So is that an is that defamation? Like we really we don't know that's true. It's a it's a it's a complicated issue just because like you can't really get consent from a dead person. So like, you know, if you reanimate them in some way to say something that they didn't say, even if it's not necessarily hurtful or harmful it is still technically something they didn't say and that really segues quite nicely.  Lie to discussing a Black Mirror episode that we would walk a while ago called called be right back. Yeah, so be right back was a the episode where there's a husband and a wife newly married and the husband dies unexpectedly and the wife can't bear to be without him. So she calls up a company who makes a robot designed specifically in the likeness of her late husband, and that company also goes through all of the husband's old social media.  Suggest all the texts. He's ever sent all the emails and everything basically any sort of Correspondence originating from him and they create a personality based on that. So they read all of his data and they essentially try to create a replication of that person. This is an example of synthetic resurrection and the way that the episode, you know is filmed and the way that the cinematography really makes it seem it really Clues you into how uncomfortable it feels to be in the position where you have a person who's synthetically resurrected. It's not that  them it's definitely not them but it's so close to being them that it like falls into the uncanny valley and and that brings us back to the central question that we faced with Michael Jackson to Prague. And and now the characters from from black mirrors be right back. Is it ethical and how do we gauge that because quite frankly all the above listed people are dead. How can we get their consent? How do we know what we're doing is in line?  With their beliefs should that consent be passed on to their next of kin so they hold the right to choose whether or not they get resurrected. What about people who have you know, corporate or media ties people that were personality figures and one scenario. Can you revive them as a synthetic Resurrection? It's really hard to tell this issue is a very complicated one. And you know, when you have a person who can no longer give their opinions or give the okay or  agree to something. It's very very hard to see what would not tarnish their reputation or tarnish the person that they were two other people. So, you know, like let's say if you have like what was the example that we were kicking around earlier. So I think we were talking about new you resurrect JFK and if you lead to do some meet and greets, but then some Corporation buys up his likeness and then uses his him to promote something like a cannabis brand or something, you know something you classify it as a sin good.  How does that work? Then? You would JFK wanted people to smoke cannabis and the answer is you never really know and you don't know. Where is that clear-cut place to draw the line. It's so hard to tell and especially in the space of advertising in general, even though a person may indicate that they supported something, you know do to like maybe reading their tweets or maybe if they're older, you know, reading their correspondence their letters or speeches. It's still not necessarily true that they would want to make an advertisement supporting it it could just be  Something that they quietly support without anyone knowing about it or something that they may be used, you know a product that they may be used time and time again, but you never know if they want to actually publicly advocate for it. So it doesn't seem right to create an advertisement. You know that has them as the centerpiece and has them as the ethos of the advertisement if they didn't necessarily want to sew like this idea or like this kind of phenomenon where you could take someone's views even in good faith, but the way that you portray  These views could potentially give people a different impression of that person. It's the general idea of like is exaggeration or a way of bending the truth. Is it Opposite to the truth? Is it lying in any way if you take a person's off and comments and turn them into something more than they actually are is it being missed is it, you know being untruthful to the person that's definitely an interesting take I don't feel personally that an extension or permutation or  Bending the truth is diametrically opposite to it. I wouldn't call it lying. So I feel like I feel like it it's definitely not the truth itself, but it's in it's not in good faith to call it lying lets, you know to kind of make this more concrete. Let's come up with the sort of example, I think I think a fairly decent example, you know, a lot of them come from politics because it's the easiest way to visualize this issue. But like let's say a candidate makes  some offhand remark about an issue that they maybe haven't talked about that much, you know a person could make a deep fake of them harping on and on about this issue and make it seem like this issue is a central part of their campaign or if not a central part at least a very important part of their campaign, you know, this could lead to people having a very different view of this candidate and maybe some people could be turned off from this Canada and never consider supporting them again, and and I completely agree with you that that's not the truth, but it's simply not  Lie, either because the candidate did bring up that issue at some point perhaps not to that extent perhaps not to that that level of Gusto but still nonetheless like it must exist in some in some percentage as a part of their platform. But but maybe a better case to consider would be the stock market. You know, let's say that you the stock market really fluctuates according to the way that people behave right and very tiny things can tip the stock can tip accompany stock in very different ways.  Let's say someone gets a recording of like a boardroom meeting of some big company and they record a moment where maybe the you know, the CEO or someone on the board of directors is very doubtful about something or like not not even very doubtful. Maybe just a fleeting moment of doubt if they create a deep fake where that doubt is Multiplied more and more investors could start to look at the company in a less favorable light and they could start pulling out their shares. They could start affecting that stock of that company just do to that one little tiny.  Fleeting moment of doubt that has been artificially Amplified II do see her point on that and I agree especially in the case of the stock market the the what I don't know what's a good word for it. I guess just the the hot-button nature of it just makes it so hard volatility volatility is probably a better way of yeah, but the volatility is definitely is is definitely speaks volumes to issues like surrounding the one with defects exactly so there could be  Be cases in which exaggeration can lead to of course exaggeration can have good or bad effects or but there could be you know, like it's important to mention that exaggeration of something that may be truthful and may I have actually happened could lead to far greater effects than someone would intend with a deep fake and that's a really important thing about deep fakes as like when you take real events that happen and you treat them in a way where you can change people's views about these events you're changing reality and a lot of ways completely.  You're changing the way people think about it and it's the same line that I said earlier in the episode. Yeah of of your raising the mental playing field, you're completely reorganizing it as you wanted to and and that's I think the danger the defects pose exactly. So in summary, we talked a lot about deep fakes, you know, how they work how they are prevalent in society today. And the I think the main takeaways are the main points that we kind of made in this episode is that there is a certain level of bending the  Truth that defects can pose they can be used for good and bad things and also as the technology of defects gets better and better as time goes on you could potentially end up in a place where people were people are unable to tell the difference between what's real. And what's fake. Yeah, and we also talked on for quite a while actually about the entire idea of synthetic Resurrection, you know, is that a faithful deep fake could can you do it and and once you do  To what extent is it? Okay to use that likeness you can use them to say to talk more about who they are fine. But then what about when you enter the deep dirty world of advertising and then you have to deal with, you know, former personalities presenting, you know promoting content that perhaps their original selves wouldn't have agreed with it's such an uncertainty that week it is just  Don't like construct a good framework on how to deal with it. And I think that's the purpose of this podcast is just to introduce, you know, the public to these issues that are prevalent and these issues these ethical quandaries that are being presented as technology gets better and better and we want, you know, all of our listeners to be very cognizant of this when you see a video think twice and try to find a point of reference maybe, you know, an unbiased news source, like the Associated Press something like that. Just try to really ground yourself in what's real.  And what's fake because as this technology gets better and better it's going to become harder and harder to tell right and you know, as time goes on we will ask and try our level best to answer some some uneasy questions on the podcast, but the important thing is that we're instantiating some kind of dialogue for people to start thinking how they feel about these issues how how they want to think about them and perhaps they can start beginning to construct their own moral framework surrounding it. Yep. And you know, that's always  Is what we wanted to do. So thank you for tuning in to this episode. This has been the second episode of beyond the Turing test deconstructing deep fix. My name is Brian of saying my name is Arnold author signing off signing off.
Hey friends, this is Rhonda Marsh and you're listening to row motivation the podcast where you'll get a daily dose of motivation and inspiration from quotes stories and scriptures that will light a fire under your day. Thanks for joining me now. Let's get into today's episode.  So yesterday, I alluded to a special segment for today that I cannot wait to have you all listen to it will also be the very first Friday friend feature segment for the row motivation podcast, and I hope to introduce you to many talented friends on future Fridays. I am so blessed to have amazingly talented friends.  I think you'll find them just as fantastic as I do these special segments will be a little bit longer than the typical episode so that you can have a chance to really get to know each friend that I feature for this inaugural segment. I had a fun phone chat with my friend Dan Baker who also happens to be the dramatic arts pastor at Christian Life Assembly in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania Christian Life assemblies large building allows these Broadway.  Style Productions to take place in its 2000 seats Sanctuary turn theater so far during the show's opening weekend 16 thousand three hundred and thirty five tickets have been sold and that my friends is a lot of tickets. Let's let Dan tell you the rest of the story.  Hello. Are you there? It's working. Whoo. This is pretty cool. I write as I was trying to figure this part out. I deleted all my questions by accident. Alright, we are going to go Rogue. You know it we're going to go Ro and Rogue. Listen. Thank you so much for being my very first friend feature Friday friend.  First friend. Well, I mean we won't get into that. Let's keep it keep it on the neutral. So people don't know. I'm a big huge dork. Okay. Now that you've let that secret out, but I wanted to do something on Fridays that feature my talented friends because I have so many wow and you are a talented friend that have a lot going on at this particular moment. And I thought it would be kind of fun to sort of not only plug what's going on this  Weekend because there are still some opportunities to come and see it. But I just wanted to get your background in what you do and what has led to what you are doing right now which involves reproduction but I don't want to get ahead of myself. I'm going to let you talk but I couldn't tell everybody what you do and how you got here. Well, alright, I can do that. So we have about 30 minutes. No, I'm just kidding.  All in a nutshell. So yeah, so I'm kind of a strange conglomeration of experiences and mixes that has brought me to where I am today. So growing up as a pastor's kid in the church and being around choirs and music and drama really since I was a young boy and didn't really have any aspirations to do full-time Ministry when I was  Into my 20 and career-minded but I always loved Church work. I love I love music and drama and mixing it with Ministry. I just always loved that. Well through college. I got hired as a performer at a theme park several theme parks across the country one in Cincinnati one in California where we did song and dance shows and then I did a debt for a few.  Summers and then went from there and did what they call touring shows where we would do little shows at a mall with some of the Hanna-Barbera characters and all that and I was the host and all and I would go and teach the teach the dancers this the show and we do a little 30 minutes show. So I got to travel the country doing that for a couple years and just that was just a lot of fun. Yeah. So so doing that I you know, I kind of got a regular job where I  I thought I'm going to make just regular money and just like most people and so on so all that to say I mean it all kind of converged in probably in my early 30s. I was I was I'd been traveling a lot with the Hanna-Barbera shows and doing that kind of stuff working as a paralegal bookkeeper at a law firm and but I was very involved in our church, and we did a big production every year I helped stage.  And do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff and just as a volunteer and at one point the music minister in charge came to me and asked if I would come on status his assistant. So that's kind of Where it All Began. It was a large church about 8,000 people and they did major Productions. And that's where I kind of got my feet wet. Just learning all about production. I mean, like I said, I've been doing theater and  That stuff before but as far as just the behind-the-scenes stuff for production, I probably was really meant to word mostly at that church and Fresno, California where we just put on big Productions. And then from there God called me to just go out and I was called to various churches as music and drama pastor and ended up at CLA doing that. It's there's really just not that many churches that do the dramatic piece of it. There's a lot of churches that do.  Obviously choirs and music and and various types of Productions. But to do the actual musical theater, right? Um, it's getting fewer and so that's kind of how I ended up here at Christian Life Assembly in Camp Hill. Yeah, what did you ever think that when you were starting out doing the Hanna-Barbera stuff and Performing and traveling on your own did you ever have any clue that it would end up being an actual Ministry with?  a title on it  No, actually no, in fact, you know to be totally honest in I was a pastor's kid and I love Jesus and love serving but I just had no aspirations to to work in a church. I think I just you know, I saw its it the pay is not great. And we struggled as a family financially and all that God met our needs but as a young boy, you're thinking I'm going to get a job and make money. Yes, and so that was my goal and it was interesting when I got you know, and  Like I said, I did did Regular secular work and then with just still doing Ministry on the side as a volunteer, but when it all converged right it right about that time. I remember the lawyer I was working for he he was training me to be a patent agent and there was big money and it was just it just all came to a head and I just hated the work. I just it just wasn't me. I mean I thought I finally going to make good money, but I didn't enjoy the work at all. It wasn't fulfilling in any way.  So when I got offered to come on in full-time ministry as an assistant to the music drama Pastor, I just felt like it was just yeah, it was it was definitely a calling and I when I when I accepted it and started working I thought wow this this is what I was created to do the all the experiences. I had up to that point all my passions. They just all kind of converge and I finally realized that's what God created me to do and that time so, right  It's funny as your personal friend. I have to say that I just can't see you as a paralegal. I'm very detailed. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I can accept that. I can accept that. You do have to be very detailed to run a production the size that you are running one. And for those who are listening that don't know anything about Christian Life Assembly and may live totally across the country or internationally. I know we have some International listeners. Yeah. I just wanted to hear you.  Talk a little bit about what goes into one of these Productions How many people are involved? How do you start from scratch writing a show? How does it go from point A to point B from open to close?  Oh and that's such a huge question Rondo? Okay, but let's see where you can do them. Like anything will any like any artist or anything creative you you bring all of your past experiences and history and everything you've seen or listen to comes into the mix right to what you're creating that you bring your bringing yourself into a into anything that you create so trim scratch. So so that really  You know, for instance, I think back to the Hanna-Barbera days and and doing those Mall shows around the country after everyone. I had to fill out a report and tell them what what did the audience like the best what worked the best what you know those kind of things and it just got my mind really tuned in to what what would people enjoy I mean, I could write something that I think is great. But other people going to really enjoy so that I think that's always in my mind when I'm trying to create something I'm thinking about was this going to be boring.  Or is people going to enjoy this and sometimes you don't know that of course, but that's kind of in my mind but like for instance this year this Christmas as you know, Rhonda because you were part of this we pulled in a group of people friends and just creative people and set around a table and just said, hey, let's just share ideas. Just my wife and I had some ideas about what we could do for for a Christmas play and but then we just started hearing ideas from other people and as  As we do that as it was just a creative brainstorm and that just kind of sparked characters and Spark storylines and different things. So I think you know that in addition to just like I said, you bring kind of bring yourself into this and and started writing and started just creating characters. I don't know it's it's such a strange thing and for me personally and  Working for a church and working getting you know getting salary to do ministry, which this this creating a production is all about Ministry for me. So, you know bringing God into the mix as far as I really believe God inspires me as I looked I watched the end product on stage and I can't even believe I wrote it right, you know, I mean, I just I have to  You know, I believe God does that with all of us he takes our gifts and and uses them but I'm just always amazed because I think wow I'm not even that good when people say oh this is such an awesome play. I'm thinking well, yeah, I'm not that good. So that credit goes to God, but it's just the the writing of the script and playing the music together is is just daily just sitting down and trying to visualize  Characters and scenes this particular one for this year is was so crazy because it spans over, you know, a hundred years decade Legacy. So I literally had to have a chart at my side at all times with who each character was and as they aged 40 years and the family tree and trying to keep that all straight. Right, right. I don't know that part of it being involved with it and  From the minute we take our places till the very end. I am running and a sweaty wigged up mess. So trust me when I say I get it that it was probably really difficult to try to figure out. Okay, where are we at this point in this scene and changing of the era's and the changing of the costumes and it just is incredible that it all has come together in such a cohesive beautiful finished product. And and I totally agree with you that  You know we can do all that we can do and pour our gifts and our talents into a project or whatever. It is that we're working on as a creative we can do that, but we only have such we have limited talents because then once we use up every little drop of what the Lord has given us as human beings to give that back and see what he does with that to create this incredible thing that we could never even think ask or imagine of  To do it, right? It's just phenomenal and that's what I believe makes it so much different than secular theater. Not that's not to say that we you and I both Joy secular enjoy secular theater. We love Broadway shows and we love all of that but the ministry element there's something I don't want to say the word magical but you know what? I mean if there's something just incredible that happens when God takes a hold of something.  That we've given all that we can give to and makes it this incredibly large otherworldly thing that is touching people and I wanted to ask you how many people are involved in in your Productions at CLA. So we have well over I don't have a total count but we have well over 400 people helping in some way or that I've helped along the way our cast is about a hundred and thirty-five people we've got, you know, there's  Just Between the amount of people that built the set painter said build costumes help dress, you know paint then and then during the shows they Usher and they greet and they sell stuff in the lobby concessions, I mean it's just it is literally I can only guess oh well over 400 people write the of touched it in some way and again, you know Broadway they have to pay everybody right that captures their music  and that's why the ticket prices are so gastronomical but right see this done as a labor of love that these people work full-time jobs, you know ten hour days and then just drive straight over here and work several hours into the evening just after day. I just I'm just amazed whether that's the cast in rehearsals or they're building sets or painting. It just it's every time it happens. I'm just in awe yeah of what people will do and and you know for this there they're  Because they love Jesus and they want to give back and they want other people to experience the love of Jesus through this gift. And you know, we charge a nominal fee for just four tickets mostly just to control crowds but it's you know for the type of production it is, you know, it's people people that have been to Broadway or been to a professional theater just are amazed at how low the ticket price is comparatively right? Because I like people that those are the people that just give  Officially, yes amazing and it really does speak to the fact that it truly is an all church ministry. So many people get involved right from the top down. In fact it, you know, your boss Pastor shanewilson is so supportive of this ministry and I can't imagine it happening without the support of you know, the lead Pastor in a church situation like it is absolutely absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to ask to have a couple more minutes, but I wanted to ask  How can people get a hold of a ticket this weekend? Is it possible are there any left? I know that a lot of our tick are shows up and sold out. But for those people that are still asking and would still love an opportunity to come and see it. How do they do that? Absolutely. We have four more performances. The matinees are either sold out or just single seats left pretty much but you can go online to see  CLA productions.com CLA productions.com and you can order tickets online is really the best thing if you're unable to do that for whatever reason online, I would just come on down and go to the will call desk and see what they have. We don't think we've ever turned anybody away we get you in somehow. So the the evening performance is definitely have the better seats tonight and tomorrow night definitely have better seats available the the matinees.  Kind of kind of rough kind of full but right but if you got them will get you in somehow. Okay, and just one more question and I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me because I know that in a couple of hours you will be seeking to all of us telling us to get to places but I get crazy around crazy fun know it but if there was one thing that you wish that every person that sits in a seat watching a Christmas Legacy if there was one thing you wish they could take away from it. What one thing. Would that be?  Wow, that's a toughie. I mean, especially right now I'm going to use two words. It's kind of I mean you can maybe bunt them into one but I think for me joy and peace, I mean those are words that are used a lot at at Christmas time, but in our society today in our world with all the anger and hatred and just crazy violence that you know, all the stuff that we see on the news every day and just in our world it's stress.  And people are overworked and overtired but just to find joy and peace as they sit through this production and ultimately we know that can only come from from God and and I just would I would love for them to experience God's joy and peace in their lives not just through the production, but that they would maybe it start there and they would just take walk away with his joy and his bees regardless of whatever they're facing.  In their lives, whatever trials they have at that they were truly find his peace and joy because it really can come out of nowhere it comes when you don't you can't believe that you would have joy and peace during some of the tragedies that we face, but that's what he offers and that's I think that's the number one thing. I would love people to have. Yeah, and that being said, I would totally agree with you and I think there's no better time than now in the culture that we are living in to to see something like this and to  To just give about two and a half hours to opening up your heart and and seeing something that might touch you in a way that you never expected to be touched. And as for those who have already seen it, I'm hearing so many incredible wonderful things and I'm in myself. I'm totally proud of you because you're my friend and I'm proud of you too. Thank you, and it's a privilege and a passion of mine to be a part.  Of these beautiful Productions, and I'm just so glad that you took a couple of minutes to spend with me today and to tell all the listeners are grow motivation a little bit about this incredible mystery mystery mystery and Ministry that you created at Christian Life Assembly so so on that note, thank you so much.

No, I can't escape. Yeah polar. I'm home. Thank you. Thanks for and just I love the dynamic duo that they have and something about her just really comes off as very real and honest and she doesn't take herself too. Seriously.  So she seems like a hard-working woman with kids and the family and she's trying to juggle it all and she's very honest about that. So I really liked and even more in-depth look into her and she didn't seem to be holding anything back exactly and I love how simple she is and not in like a simpleton type way, but just I could relate to her because yeah, like you said she's a mom and I love house. / she was a writer then it was like booop dropped weight. Might as well get on TV, you know, all those types of things. So I just kind of loved how her journey sounds just very similar to  any it could have she could be any of us, which is very relatable. And I think that's why she's been around for as long as she has because she's not putting on any show. She's just saying this is who I am. This is my talent. This is my worth and I'm funny which is obviously very helpful, but she's just I think she's got what it takes to keep going. Yeah. I absolutely agree. So let's dive into what she said. One of the favorite things that I like that she said is that she's in the reboot stage and I love that because on this show, especially we talk so much about he's flow Grace.  Tuition listening the inner knowing and when you get to a space where you can recognize hey, this is a moment where I don't know if I'm going to just put out put out and do right. Now. I'm going to fall back and kind of hear and listen to my inner voice to see what it is. I'm to do next and to know not to rush that is like very valuable and beautiful. I think that's an interesting perspective to because we're basically taught to be go-getters to go after things, but I  I definitely agree with you. There's a beauty and you can't rush everything and that's one of my biggest struggles though Peyton paid thing and just trying to get stuff done. But you know, I find myself making mistakes when I rush so that can be applied to your everyday life. You can't just jump into things on making decisions because in your mind at the time you might be thinking I'm being proactive but in reality you're not executing properly because you're just trying to get there but do you even know what you're trying to get and why you're trying to get it you have to figure out the core before making those leaves. Yeah.  Reassess and of course reboot sounds just like a computer there's times where obviously our computer needs to shut off. And if you have a PC right like you get so many pups and little things could be viruses PC start to run really slow if they're running for a long time. So you shut it down and reboot. And normally when you bring it back up not only are all those windows closed, but all the things that clean the system pop up, right like you want to activate this start, you know, and so just like a computer needs it. We need it as much as sometimes it's a good idea to just  Especially when you're as accomplished as her you have the room and I love how she has so much space to focus on her family. It's kind of clean out and then just see what comes up next get some rest and be open to the flow and she seems to be reaching her goals in a very healthy way where yes, she can recognize that she's proud of what she's done, but she's also not so hungry for the next thing that she forgets to enjoy the moment as it's happening and I think unfortunately with a lot of successful people we see them getting so addicted to the high of 16.  Us that they stop celebrating and I've been learning a lot about that too that it's so important to celebrate the little ones along the way because that's how you're going to keep enjoying not feeling and wanting it because you have you ever see people winning great Awards and huge accomplishments and they don't even smile. Yeah your stone face and to me it's like I don't think you're ever I don't know if it's a cool thing or what but I just don't think you ever need to be too cool to be excited about any accomplishment and you see a lot about though and I'm sure it is because you just get  Get so used to it, but we should always be excited for what greatness coming into our life. Yeah, I think people are hard on themselves and just to have a little example of myself in that because I kind of used to be someone to just I'd have a great party and be like, okay, that's great. But next month we and it's like hold on girl 267 people came to this party. This was your first like stop, you know, and ask yourself. Am I even at this party like, you know, come on and right now, I'm restart. I'm doing my YouTube channel and I'm you know, really being consistent with Mike.  Aunt and something. I'm intending to grow and I've gotten 22 new subscribers in the past week. So sure I need a thousand followers in 22 in the grand scheme of thing may not seem like a big drop in the bucket somewhere. Yes, but it is so I've been celebrating that thank you to all my 22 new subscribers. I love you, and I'm excited that you exist. So you're so right. It's so good to just take a moment and do that and it does seem like you said she's chasing.  Seeing her goals and accomplishing them in a healthy way, especially being a mom. I'm sure she needs well, obviously she needs time for her two kids. She kind of shared how the time she had for her first child is very different from the time she had for her second child, right and what I really liked talking about her playing Thera Palin for the first time it reminded me of what you said because she talks about that. She wasn't even that nervous to play this iconic role with so much pressure people judging how she's going to do preaching this.  Picture and she just said that she knew her life was imbalance. She knew that she was doing the best she could so if it worked out or if it didn't she could still go home to her loving family and it just made me think of what you speak on and being anchored and knowing yourself and ultimately you are untouchable when you get to that place. It's just getting to that place and then being able to stay in that place because I do believe you can do a lot of work to feel like you're there and maybe fall back down which is ok, which is complete normal and human nature, but I do think when you know what you have and you know,  Your value your a lot more willing to accept when things don't work out because your perspective is different. You don't see it as a huge failure just like okay next next thing next turn. Yeah, not this, you know designed to be as catastrophic as we might make it. Yeah, and I think that's something that you grow into if you have it right out the gate shout out to you, but I think it's something you grow into as maturity because it's it as you were talking. I'm just picturing this big beautiful tree with these Deep Roots. It's going to be much harder for a storm to come by and knock over a  Tree with that is deep-rooted than it is the analogy. Yeah, you know then like a twig. That's just like oh my God, I didn't get this and it's cracks that done and what are we going to do to rebuild because my whole life just fell apart because this didn't work out but when you're planted and rooted and healthy whether something works out or not, you're still standing and that is where you want to be and shout out to Oprah just for this ability to get people to completely open up because from what I know of Tina Fey, it's funny woman, and that's what I expected.  Her so thinking about it. She easily could have made a joke when things got serious, which a lot of people do they kind of laughed their way out of things that are uncomfortable, but she really went there even talking about her weight loss and that's a very real thing for people to not want to be on camera because they're not comfortable with their body and even this expectation that maybe on Weight Watchers. She has to still be counting points and she's like, you know, what right now I'm not and I probably will again when I want to do this particular role or be on camera, but she's very honest and how  Then her husband eating better to helps her and that makes me think about okay and this case we're talking about food, but the people we surround ourselves with the kind of energy that we have in our lives is ultimately gonna take toll on how we start to act. So just how important that is to choose your friends wisely and to be okay with cutting people out of your life if they it's not like everyone has to serve you all the time, but serve you in some form of happiness or motivation. I'm very happy to say that I think everyone in my life that I'm choosing to have a  My life does make me better. Oh, I love that and I feel like you feel it. And you just it's easier to let go of negative energy to when you're like look at all of these great people. So it's just like why do I need this from you know what? I mean? It's like you just don't need it. And that's okay. Yeah. It's very true. It being surrounded by good people. I love that because I remember an opportunity where a friend of mine found strength for herself through looking at a situation. I went through and I didn't even know she was looking at the time so you're right when you're surrounded by people.  Who share the same values? Yeah, maybe she's not counting points of the time but like you said with her husband cooking healthy. She's just by environment and Association getting exactly what it is. She needs to move forward and is holding yourself accountable. It's kind of the thing. It's like how you do one thing is how you do everything and I think you just start to do those daily practices of little things along the way and you find that it's so much easier to be held accountable for those bigger goals that you had in mind and all those things are  Seeing you for what you want in the end, and she also talks a lot about comedy and we see this a very fine line sometimes with comedy of was off limits, especially in today's climate anyone anywhere can be sensitive or upset by something. Yeah, and she does address that in theory of Comedy. No, it shouldn't be off-limits. But also you have to expect that people will get offended and what do you think about that? I mean, I have a different point of view and I know she has to definitely like  I said I don't want to hurt anyone and like she said in today's political climate it is still your job to be funny and a lot of things we were talking about it. It's not funny. But at the same time I love comedy and I I really love being able to put a good old joke on something. I don't really feel sensitive because I watch black comedy and they go anger. We be talking about slavery. That's not funny. But we talked about you know, because it's like you take your power back in a sense. You take your power back. It's like it happened. You know it.  Be funny it's made for comic relief and I really am bothered by everyone being so sensitive. Like even when Kevin Hart was didn't have the opportunity to do the Oscars. I'm like dude. He doesn't hate gay people like, you know, this was just one big on gays and I understand people whatever but it's like he can up there talk about black folks. He can of you're talking about people's mama this that all these things and it's just like come on this it's a joke. This is comedy. That's what it's supposed to be taken.  Our and and let's just leave it at that comedy has always been a platform as a relief. Like I feel like not that it started during the Great Depression or something like that. But I think there were a lot of hidden messages and political things that went on in comedy and it was kind of like an underground thing where people went to get comic relief, but kind of talk about the things behind the scene and it's just it can be cool. I don't want us to be so sensitive because it's not meant to hurt me one thing you have to go into. I honestly love if I  Get to be made fun of I got to be made fun of once but you feel like you're part of the show. And yeah, I have to walk in the room knowing this is what it is. If you feel like you're going to be very sensitive to it's just not for you, correct. But again, I do like that she acknowledged that you know in theory. No, but you have to be ready for that. It's part of the gig. Yeah, and then talking about mean girls with relational aggression and I love how she called Oprah how she's like you're showing you right now, but we just design idea of you know, we say we want to surround ourselves with positive people.  At the same concept of finding people that support us so calling someone ugly is not going to make you prettier right and getting mad that you didn't get the job and they did it's not suddenly going to make you get the job. So it's just like trusting that you know, it's not always easy, especially if you find yourself in Time After Time After Time, you see everyone winning around you and you're not I think it's very normal to start to feel bad and even feel jealous, but I think it's important to catch yourself in those moments and realize that these things are happening because it's supposed to  Happen for them and I need to trust that. My time is coming. Yeah, and then I also think that if we want to take it just you know, maybe one step higher is that all the conversations we have we know good and well if someone has the audacity to call someone else ugly there. It's a mirror reflection of themselves. So there's something within them they don't like and when you're evolved enough to see that you take know we all know calling someone ugly isn't going to make you prettier. However, what is the deeper issue going on with that person in those people with the social aggressions that and  I want them to feel pain the way that you're feeling pain. Yeah, so we have an opportunity to heal each other with that but just on a basic level for sure. It's it doesn't serve anyone a lot of people talk about Twitter and I've seen some terrible things on Twitter Tina Fey's that she doesn't do Twitter because people are so cruel, but I love Twitter so much. I'm fat following the most awesome people and I get so much knowledge and wisdom. So I think we need to think about these tools to and use them, you know to our  The best of our abilities so we're not being sucked into the dark side of things and it's the same way when we pick our friends. It's the same things when we choose our words. It's the same thing when we think about what kind of entertainment we want to take in. So every light has a Darkness associated with it, but it's choosing what side you want to be on correct, which is not like we said, it's not like it's always easy and it gets confusing and sometimes people show you darkseid's that you didn't know we're there and you have to make really hard decisions, but I think that's the whole part of life and figuring it out.  And you're going to be shown what's meant for you? You're going to be shown what you it's like at if you can't have what you want, but you get what you need type thing. I think that's that very real and we get it for ourselves. I've had times where I've had the ability to check myself because I was like, oh, why did I want to see? What was that little smart comment about Jamie like what you know, what was in you that made you feel sassy in that moment or whatever. So it's an opportunity to grow at the end of the day. Yeah and speaking of growing she talks a lot about diversity.  Our city and just having representation on camera of all walks of life and she says the more diverse the room the better and I love this. You know, I'm a quote girl. She says you wouldn't make a soup with one ingredient and expected to be good. Correct? And if there's one thing I can relate to its, you know analogies with food, but that makes so much sense. Right? Like you don't put one ingredient and expected to be good. You're always mixing things and cooking and making a Melting Pot literally. So it's just like if we applied that concept to so many more things in our life. It's kind of like a dumb.  Moment. Obviously, you need you need color. You need all different types of personalities. That's what makes something come alive. Yeah, exactly like when she was saying, how are you going to do a show about Mexicans or even make a joke about you know Mexican or Heritage or anything or whatever is going to be whatever the narrative is going to be but there's no Mexican in the room or you know, so it just it makes it gives things such beauty when it has the flavors that also makes me think of something kind of to aside I was watching  Ying I was looking on Twitter and I think Tyler Perry had posted he writes like all his stuff and while I admire the work horse and the you know the diligence he puts into the work there's also kind of like one there's a similarity and kind of OneNote to some of his pieces or it's like okay, I can see that you don't have a writers room. It's just you and your perspectives which isn't terrible but it's it also you kind of it's a little less flavorful right after a while. I feel that  I sometimes with certain Comics then they have a very particular style the first couple times. It's really funny. But then it's like all right, is that I know what show I'm getting already type thing. But it's also you stick to your brand and your craft. So it is what it is with that. But yeah, I mean, I think that's one of the hardest things about this industry is once you're on top figuring out how to stay on top getting people interested and it's a great reminder to be humble because you just you never know who's around the corner. So it's just that's such a testament to being  went to and enjoying where you are because you have no idea what's around the corner and you just said something about beauty and it made me think about Tina Fey saying that the idea of not in which we've heard over speak on this before growing up not particularly considered beautiful and how much of a blessing she super has because she I mean it makes a lot of sense if if you grow up with people just treating you like you're so special because you're beautiful I could see how you don't really feel like you need to develop more than just that but the ones that were not  Treated that way typically do have much more depth to their personality because they had to and had other ways to develop other aspects of themselves. Not just I'm pretty and that's it. And I think I already know the answer to this question, but she talks about other people being treated differently because they're beautiful. So do you yourself find yourself treating on their Beautiful People differently? Hmm. Maybe I think we all have a natural bias. Like I think we  we brushed over this but all my friends are pretty and I don't know if it's like an attraction thing or if it's just like, oh, she's cute. We want to be friends. Like I don't know. I don't really know what it is. Although I do know for sure that I I see beauty in everyone for me. It's a smile. It's the warmth. It's a that draws me to people but yeah, we live in LA and sometimes I can't tell I think I do have the same bias. Everyone else says if we see someone that looks visually prettier like  Like the outfit becomes cuter the makeup becomes more interesting the hairstyle is more. I don't know a mix of and I don't mean this in a conceited way as like we think we're so gorgeous. But I think it's a little bit of relatability because if you're like, oh, I like that outfit. I Can Tell She's Got style. I like clothes and you kind of figure out things that you connect with and maybe even a part of you wants to have something they have like I'll see myself watching a show because the cast is attractive sometimes and I'm like why am I so into this?  The Show versus this one and when I really thought about it, I realized the cast was more attractive and then I felt super shallow, but I was just like I think a part of me just enjoys seeing Beauty which I don't feel bad about I do believe that's a natural thing, but it's and it's almost like with that you guy can hit on you and if if he's not attractive it could be creepy if he is attractive suddenly and so romantic correct. It does play a huge role. But then I think does that have to be a bad thing? Because if we're using our eyes to look,  And we're seeing physical Beauty. That's that but I also use my heart to see in different ways. There's also people with other Geniuses that just simply Stand Out beyond the rest if you are smarter at this or that or better at this or that like even some athletes like let's say LeBron James. I don't mind. I don't think he's like the sexiest guy and whatever but there's something sexy about him because of his other abilities. Yeah, well, you know to each their own to me, it's not he's not modeling. Oh sure like, you know can definitely go  More than just an invisible. Yeah, but because he can play ball because he has discipline because he loves his family. All those other aspects and attributes would have me looking at him over somebody else. So maybe we can just have space if it's beauty of its beauty if it's loyalty is loyalty if it's scale. It's kill brains its brains and just be cool with it. We like that better, I guess. Yeah, absolutely. And I think at the end of the day maybe the attractiveness the outward appearance is what draws you in but we're not the girls are going to stay if the guy's an asshole just because he's attractive it's like, okay.  To offer me more than that Beauty on a deeper level because ultimately those looks will fade and it's not going to be enough. But unfortunately the person has a chance to do it and I think that's what she was saying about not being a good-looking teenager. Yeah fully the people that got older and have a chance to be beautiful or our beautiful had a chance to like go through some other things. So they have those layers and had a chance to build that up and attractiveness speak so much louder when someone has confidence in a good personality, you know, how you can meet someone and maybe you see him on a  An app you're not blown away, but getting to know their personality or like wow, this guy's son just got 10 points was that so it's huge and she even talks about just being viewed losing weight and how people started reintroducing themselves to her not crazy. Like even you can't even see me before but you know where I related to that is in my hairstyles. So she said that it's important for people to quote unquote move through different bodies, and I was relating to that with hairstyles when my hair is natural I get a completely different.  Then one of the long and curly then when there's highlights then when it's a short and so I totally I've had people do the same thing completely did not recognize me because that my hair went from Nashville to these people that you see pretty often or enough to where it's like dude like won't even say you're like we've met yeah, sometimes I just let it be but it's wild because moving through different bodies or hairstyles our looks or stages. It's very interesting and it's because I think of the factor like depending on what those people are.  Into they really might not have seen you before. Yeah, and I think it does depend if you are saying that after about studio in your meeting like 50 people out of time or something and then someone changes their hairstyle like oh sorry, I might because I've done that. I've accidentally reintroduce myself to people and you definitely don't mean anything. Yeah in a bad way, but but I think their concept of what people notice yeah and being treated differently is especially in a la like that is a very real thing. I've never witnessed. Someone being turned down from a club, but I got my God  Can't even I wouldn't even want to go to a place that would do that with if I was with someone they did that. I believe we're all leaving. Yeah, absolutely. No, like that's just that's terrible and it happens. She talks about taking a more serious turn. She does talk about lessons that have taken her the longest to learn and this is what I would like us to answer as well. Oh God the thing. Mmm. So, okay. I did have to think about this one. Yeah. I kind of feel like it has  Something just so I don't take too long to think about it because I will sit here and try to really come up with but I think that everything doesn't have to be done right now. I used to put a lot of pressure on myself to get things done. Now if I'm inspired by something and want to create something I don't have to do it now. Like I think I've said this before but I know I'm going to write a book the old me would have tried to have that book done by the end of the week the new Minos. Okay. I might do that book at 40. It's in there. I don't know. We'll see but this is where I'm going to align with Tina Fey and allow.  The reboot when it comes up and says you come to three. Yeah, my story will evolve. I don't know it's there but it took me a long time to learn not to put the pressure on myself to get things done. Do this do that. I have stepped into a space of ease and flow where I can accept Okay, I want to do that, but maybe it won't be today or tomorrow, but it's so it allows you to plan not pressure myself. It's hard to be creative with the pressure and you know, so that probably took  Me a while to learn that because I didn't understand. I'm like I don't get it. I'm talented I showed up I did the work why I don't understand thing that goes back to that just like forcing things to happen were literally taking kind of the universe and shoving it all in one space one and saying whoa, we're not ready for you to be there yet fill out. Hold on. It's good work. I got to yeah, I'd that was so it took me a long time to learn but I think I'm getting a hang of it in such a good way because even yesterday I had a thought like okay, this is something I want to change that would have stressed me out.  For but now I can see because I've seen things change over time. And if I did not take the time to acknowledge the change I would have missed it because the change was so gradual and it took so long will longer than I would have guessed that I'd miss it. If I didn't re-look revisit the situation to acknowledge the change but the things were asking for always there most of the time we're not looking at it because it doesn't look exactly the way we thought they were going to unfold to fastest. Yeah, so  I'm so glad for yeah that growth in myself. What about for you? So I had to think about this one and I think it comes down to wanting everyone to like me and accepting that there are people that are not always gonna like me and there's gonna be just people that nothing bad has to happen, but we just maybe don't click and that's okay to accept that just not everyone is going to be in your life and not everyone is going to want to be your friend and it's okay.  You just be happy with what you have because I am surrounded by so much love and I think about that all the time how lucky I am to have the family and the friends. So I think it's a blessing that it does stand out to me as much when it doesn't but if I you know a certain person at work or job or something doesn't go according to my plan. I'm immediately just feel like no like what did I do wrong? And then just accepting that I did the best I could and not you don't Vibe with everyone and not everyone is going to be wanting to sip your Kool-Aid and yeah.  I think that's an expression but who made is good though? You know, it seems like that's okay. Yeah, embracing that and accepting that that's a good one. I think I'd have to put that on my list too because that used to bother me to like but what did I do? What did I say? I didn't knew so many people pleaser. Yeah exactly, which is kind of like Tina Fey's and she feels like she got over she was a pleaser. You don't have to be so obedient and she's learned to say no and she's happy with that and she talks about her 20/20 vision and very an alignment of what we talked about. Just wanting to be present.  She can hear what the hell she's supposed to do next. Okay, that is so everything and it's good. It's great for us to repeat it because different people are going to hear it in different ways and receive it differently, but it's so good book just said what happened that you just said exactly what my book was saying earlier. It's like many people will read this and each one will get a different kind of message. Yeah, and they'll receive it differently or I guess it's what questions in your mind. You're subconsciously asking that's where you'll receive the message. Yeah, so hopefully at least these few times  Somebody's receiving just be present and to relax and let things flow because they will I am doing better when I catch myself drifting or if I'm not focusing I say, all right, where'd you go? Come back? And I just like I just have a healthier self-talk now, we're instead of being like Oh my God. Why am I stressed out right now? You've no reason to be stressed out. Why are you rushing? I'm like I literally said the other day you have no reason to rush you have time and I had to say it but I did that whole practice of say the words out of your mouth to hear it back in and that did help was just like  What's your rush them for a girl? Yeah, he'll I find myself doing I literally until myself the same thing because I do we get the sense of anxiety or Panic or have to be here and there's so many things to hold on Jake just even how you doing. I just know I'm like, yeah go go go mentality, but it's trapping us. It's gonna kill us one day and I don't want to I'm literally running. I don't want to run out of time. I can I have to tell myself like Jamie you can only pretty much do one thing at a time. So do that first if it takes an  Five minutes it is what it is like girl. I just can't be pressed for nothing these days because it does take up too much space and energy and when you think about it to do one thing at a time and really do it correctly. It's probably going to save you time because now you're not gonna have to go back and fix what you messed up because you were rushing correct and look at that or ran out the house. I forgot something you needed or you ready for a wine? Yes. Yes. Yeah. This is really good. I did really like what she talked about to now that we're talking about brushing and moving around is being the little old.  Lady in New York just running around and still move in and telling people what's going on. Oh my gosh. I don't want to rush too much, but I know wow and how important that is.  As in your life in general just to really focus on getting the right amount of rest at night and we talked about are you getting enough sleep this week? And we have 35 that's a yes and 65% say no and one of my favorite comments was just someone writing a LOL just being like, of course. I'm not getting enough sleep. What do you but it's that's something I think we all need to work on. And thankfully there's a lot of resources out there and it doesn't have to be you know, any heavy drugs. I'm down with a little marijuana or see  BD always helpful, but yeah, you can do it in really healthy ways. And this does bring me to what I wanted to share with them. Can I jump the gun and do our news and gossip? Yes, absolutely gossip. So meditation with Deepak Chopra is coming up its our 21 day free meditation experience. I did it last year. It's awesome. You guys are the last year? Yeah. So cool. You just play their videos so they completely guide you through it. If you're not completely comfortable with meditation. It's  Listen for as long as you want, there's really no guidelines or rules. And that's why I find myself being a restaurant to this type of thing. So you'll get an email every day of the twenty one week series. It's going to start February 3rd, and it's going to go to February 17th. And like I said sign up we put the link for you guys in our description. So you'll be able to sign up and each day. You'll get an email if you miss it. No big deal. It's just really silencing the mind and I think it's really important and very on-brand for what we've been discussing. Yeah.  Yeah, and just to throw in a quick side note you can meditate in 30 seconds. If you can only get yourself to a 30-second moment, that is still meditation. You don't feel it. You don't just sit there for 30 minutes like a guru so you can still get benefits and value that and if there's no rules to it, it could rattles good for you. Yes, and so last but not least. We are going to jump into our special segment on your soul your journey to become more inspired and connected to the deeper world around us starts right now. Well, you better get it calm.

So yeah, I do it. I'm doing it. Yes, I think my I'm going to own my soul this week by it's not just remaining positive and optimistic. But when I see something that I consider an obstacle or something  Needs to be done approaching it with a healthy timeline and just being open about how the change unfolds instead of being pressed about what it needs to look like just for a really quick example. I know that I'm not too happy with my neighborhood, but I love my apartment, but I think my attachment to my apartment could be holding me back. So instead of I'm releasing that and just allowing whatever's supposed to come sir come without the pressure of let me go look for a place. Let me do this dude.

It's not third it's silent. I don't know about you but this freaks me out. So I started a podcast my antidote to this silliness. It's time to blow our minds. My name is Will cleaning. Welcome to my podcast. Please blow my mind. There's how's it going bro? Good brush good.  I never know how to start these things but it feels natural here. We've got our nice drinks and we're talking to each other then over here. We've got all this technology and it's that place. I've been sitting in you know, it's like what does it mean to have these virtual this virtual world? You know, I heard you I heard like an hour of you speaking on another podcast, but we've never met but there's this weird thing like, I don't know how to explain it, you know, and it's just really interesting for me, too.  to travel down this podcast Journey because like I say to you when we first caught up, you meet people your talk and my sense is that  I wonder if that's what part of your Maori movement is speaking to is this idea of like a real connection as opposed to just being connected. You know what I mean? Yeah, I do bro. I do. Absolutely. I mean like when I did put out their podcast that's it was almost like a trigger of a frequency that opened up a door for many others or many other like-minded people or people that were interested about the topic that we were talking about and invited them into the space because it  A space where I wanted to isolate me and the presenter who was more or less a form for me to have a voice and send that message out as far as we possibly could in order for people to receive a mechanism. So powerful that it just blows people away. So when you reached out for are thought to myself here's another chance is another opportunity to articulate myself because sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing. Yeah, it's almost like this is just the Avatar of what goes on and on even know what I'm going to say at any given time.  Depends on what I'm inspired by right there, that's where the trigger of thought comes from. And you know, if I'm in tune with it, I'm going to I'm going to go for it man. That's such an amazing point because we are all not knowing what frequency and it must be that our frequency can change. You know, I mean it does if you look at it as you can go from smiling to crying and all will in watching a film, you know, and I wonder if that's what a film's doing. It's tapping into your frequency as as as everything, you know, it's like we're all on this.  We're all on this Mission man, and and are you to tap into something that day that I listened to the podcast and it was something that I've been trying to work out. I don't quite know what it is. I think it's something like there feels like there's a bit of a lack of meaning to our modern world and people are a little bit hesitant to say, let's go back to the old ways because the old ways for a lot of people represent.  Not the best ideas. They represent kind of old-fashioned ideas. Like what do you mean when you say let's go back to the old ways. Do you mean where people didn't get it equal go at things. Do you mean we're one class rules? And so I understand that tension, but at the same time this this modern thinking  I don't know. It's it makes us think about consumerism and being addicted to you know, the Facebook and having these algorithms driving our emotions. You know, it's a lie. I mean, that's a frequency again. So talking to you my senses that you're someone's who's exploring taking good ideas from the old times. Would that be accurate, you know, I use traditional Concepts as a guide bro, and it's not necessarily meaning.  Let's live back in the old days. I mean, I'd love to take one day of my life and go let me just have a taste of what it felt like in 1808 with my ancestors and sitting around them at that given time and listening into the politics of what happened in those days. Like I visualize that and sometimes in my meditation practice I take myself back there. Yeah, because I draw on them draw upon them for inspiration. Now, what was the mentality like back then and how did they survive because everything was about survival, but what I do see in those planes is that they knew.  I knew how to raise children in a way where they could read their vibration if their energy was up really really high. So if they were you walk I was a walkover or if they were Navigators if they were Carver's of they were cultivators if they were Hunters if they would gather as if they were vibing in that then they would they would push them there and and guide them towards exploring the potential of what there was about because they were vibing about it and then bring them back into a neutral space to live and say  Communal village now for me. It's like we don't have that at all whatsoever. And I can only draw on my own experience when I was brought up by the old people when I was lucky and fortunate enough to be bought out by the old people and then I had to learn this Parker Hawaii because I was very totally immersed and Del Mal di that when I did go into the park are environment. It was a shell shock for me, you know, it was almost like I did turn into this hard coconut that you couldn't penetrate because inside that coconut was all of the style that I wanted to protect and know  One could penetrate it to change my the way that my roots have been vind and bowel by the old people. So for me, it was really protection thing. But when I went into a bucket has a society I was put into this environment where I had to learn everything everybody else had to learn and I was like man, I'm no good at any of this so I couldn't read or write but even by the time I left college and I went to Wellington College which is, you know, pretty high up there in terms of the educational system in their practices. So I really just went dead eat my lunch and play rugby because that's all I was good at I vibe.  On eating lunch and I've done playing rugby and for me, there was no other option. So teachers didn't really know what to do with me and what first experience sitting in an ESO English class with a bunch of Asians who couldn't speak English and it was really weird. I'm sitting here talking to Finn were in my own lands sitting in a classroom environment with a bunch of Asians going. How do I read or write English, but I had to really push past that barrier because I thought to myself as a half-caste malti, how am I going to articulate myself in both?  Both Worlds, how am I going to get up in a pakeha for him and be comfortable with how my going to get up in a Maori form and be comfortable? How am I going to set the example for it means to be a fused Maori Parker in today's society and for me it was really about making sure that I put an effort on both sides so that I find the balance of it. That's an interesting distinction because it can feel like when you're driven by fear to find meaning that you've just got to grab onto whatever, you know, and I feel the sense of you know, even if it's men against women.  What against Brown and my feeling is always because I came from both that I thought that the overall goal. When you take a real wide look was for us to work out how we can take the best of both but I think that makes sense, but I don't really hear many people talking about that. You know, I kind of here like because you know, I guess deep down every different culture gives us something and I just think it's not about  You know taking everything it's maybe some good ideas from here and some good ideas from there. There's that kind of ring a bell with you. It does. I mean like it was noted back when Parker her first arrived then I'll tell Dwight that there wasn't a vicious cycle not in my tribe where he anyway the settlers back their shared a lot of their tools with us Maori and we were you know, Maori being to do we like to explore those things. So we adapted to the Customs that they brought over in the tools that they had as long as the tick on their protocols were being respected.  We got along quite fine. It wasn't until their upline started to get a little bit Rowdy with who was owning what and who had the wonderful what where and when that battle started to take place around I'll double and in still to this day that nobody really in New Zealand understands what New Zealand walls were all about but it's something that we need to be educated about because it does paint a picture in an image about who we are as a people here in Ottawa and why we are not fusing that Oneness that everybody's saying we should be one country but  We're two cultures living on Bart's wonder who would not tell Tony yet. We still don't really have the fusion, right? So it's up to somebody like myself half-caste Molly Parker, huh to grab then articulate what that looks like to show you the beautiful side of what it means to be Maori to understand and explore the other side of my pocket honor and for me if I can do that and be an examples of that then that's a step forward in the right direction for us and says that what motor movement is about Marty movement know. Yeah, the more times I get asked this question.  More times I could really think about Laura Martin Luther breakfast is good practice Molly movement to me. Barry would really was pushed and driven by the poor steps that we currently under here and of data and not only that we take those stats here in El Dora and I look where the holes are in terms of, you know, being 52% of our prison population are filled with Maori half of them filled with Marvel, you know suicide obesity. We can go down all of that track.  And so I thought to myself what is the breakdown who is the disconnection and why this is all happening. So I really went into my Master's through that one. We are Annie and one of my papers was on Maori mythology and our connection back to you know, our genealogy and you know how we stem back to the Creator and what therefore couple looks like to us somewhere along the line and I can pinpoint it down to colonization as which was where become distracted and so for me it was about you know, how do I be?  Because they were as the colonization State then there was the effects of colonization bear on after and then we had the generation above us who were beaten and battered for speaking the drill. Then there was the urban drift and then we are the product of the urban drift. So that's where the state is. So I had to go back in time to really retrace that and all we're doing in terms of delivering that is really if I can bring those steps down by two percent every year then I'm doing my job and as part of the way.  Through educating and talking like we are now or I mean I guess my question is is it enough to talk or do you have to go deeper and actually, you know?  If you going to go to the gym you have to do more than just turn up in the car park. Yep. Yep. There has to be a plan is to be a program in place for our people to recognize that the intergenerational trauma that we've inherited over time is like peeling back onion layers, but we are strong Believers that we can heal our upline we can hear all of it, but we can't heal our downline. We can only pass on what we've inherited. Okay, so just on that point, so it's you going forward with  Your kids you can directly influence them Yo, you need to put that work in there. And are you saying you can't so you can't change the past but you can change the future. Yep. Absolutely. But you have to be present to be able to do that. I can only example myself in front of my children. I can't change what's already inside them that DNA process between me and their mother was written in the stars so to speak so when they come here, it's like their Destiny is already written for them.  But their state of their environment is absolutely important for them to be able to see to feel to smelt a touch so that they understand that their cultural values have been implemented them since they were babies and we've got really a seven-year opportunity to make a big powerful difference inside their subconscious mind for them to be able to consciously make sound choices for themselves. And once we go down that route, it's almost automatic. Like you can foresee their future that their Destiny in terms of their cultural practices.  Already been paved out for them and we stopped by giving them really rich Maori traditional names. And once we fused it with a God or the not sewer, then they are connected to the environment. So everything interconnects and then it's just weaving themselves and all we do is we just guide them along instead of suppressing them to say you think this way you see this and you do that because really they're not being themselves. They're doing what I'm telling them to do, right? See it's a big change. Do you think every culture has their own version of this? I mean there must be  Yeah, I like I guess what I'm asking is I wonder if it's in built in every human too. You know, if you're not being told what to do. If you have you know, some general love around you if these things come out or you know, because I spend a lot of time wondering why why is this why we're so different. You know what? I mean? We're we all are different, you know, it seems to be in built in the human story a that that we're different. And is that put that way so  That we can never get too.  You know, like I know humans get a little bit.  We like to settle on an idea and in that us we just roll with the punches, you know, but when you see difference everywhere, you can't help but notice that difference and I wonder if it's like I guess what I'm saying, bro is like, you know, where did you go to learn all of these things where they in built a new or did you have to get like a was it passed on through elders? And what's that process for you, bro? It's a pretty magical process.  Like I said before we've got you know, the first seven years of your life and some of the most important times in terms of downloading the structures of the subconscious mind and emotionally making you sound from their own earn that the the spiritual element in the physical plane takes place. So in that first seven years, you're almost like gifted to the elders for them to download esoteric knowledge inside of your mind so that you know, when it's planted inside of there all it's doing is the fusing all these routes through into the to the platform of where you become.  Unconsciously aware that you're actually your behavior patterns are actually formulated for you. And inside of that is it's creating.  Such a massive opportunity for each and each individual to have access to their infinite potential. You know, that's human power to me. It's like, you know, if you can tap into your powers and you understand the might of your powers and you can use that for good then you know, you're going to have a massive impact in the world and there are tools and around how that is going to be. It's going to keep you accountable first and foremost, you know, because when it's it's not like you can just go out there and you know, where's your pal?  All over the show and not have any cords of cause and effect of you know what you're what you're implementing but I understand that the features of who we are as human beings that we all are different varying. There are cultural differences. Their religious differences in there are so many gurus out there that are you know, opening the minds of people's eyes to say, you know, there's not one hat fits all and this is where I feel like your connection with your spirituality or your connection with God or Allah or you or whatever you  want to call them as one of the most in key important ingredients is that people are lacking there waiting to be fed by the hand of the man instead of going and exploring for themselves to understand that they themselves can perform imperfect themselves as just as great as anybody else in this world and this planet you will do any as your journey, you know, and nobody has the right to come and take that money will take that from beneath you you have the ability to be able to explore that for yourself, but it's been boxed off and hidden from us about how we explain.  That it's been boxed off in an unbelievable way because I'm trying to keep up with what you're saying. But I have the boxes coming up saying hold on a minute. What does that mean? Where can I read about that? Where's the science on you know, and I feel like there needs to be a bit less of that because clearly the science and stuff isn't all working. But people are what there's a decent amount of people who are deeply unhappy even in this country team suicides some of the highest in the world.  And it's like we've got all of the latest gadgets and theories and algorithms, but it's not working and I think a bunch of people are thinking what the hell do we do about it? And I can only start thinking well,  How did our ancestors you know from whatever culture you come from? I think they lived as opposed to were just here passing time doing work and stuff like that a yeah, absolutely brilliant and I'm still a baby in our world man. I mean like there are many talking and in the Maori culture who have way more knowledge than I do and you know, there's sometimes they're kept so secret that you know, they have to be protected in that in that mites and you know when I do.  You come across their their intelligence and I hear their wisdom. You know, it really Sparks a you know, deeply grateful to have access to them because in our world science is still trying to catch up to us like with the vast amount of knowledge that people always I get mr. Zalto bro. We're not careful we can have read about that stuff. Like you can't you can't read about it because it's written in the stars and it's a star gaze met. That's that's our Sky. You don't need the technology on the sky and I when we don't have sky at home, I'll sky is out.  Outside we Master mind and read maps from the Star gaze and the Clusters that are already written out there did there every night the same patterns just depending on the seasons they'll twist in they'll turn and they'll tell a different story. So the dimensions change of it, but they tell a different story but say the same thing and inside of our Maori meeting house has our carvings. They tell ancient stories of history that goes way back into the great migration of how our people came across from  Yq islands in the other the beginning place for us and all of those stories have been inherited through through carvings through oratory through sound through music through chanting. So, you know, our University is really it's very pure but you have to understand that in the knowing you have to create Stillness for yourself. It's not in a book where it's where it's just hand fits you there's a lot of things happening when you inherit the stopper knowledge and when you were going through school and being  And to put into a box what the like was their part of you that was getting in that box or we always like how you are now here, but I was either screaming or sleeping. Those were the two options that I had when it was, you know coming at me just coming to my straight away - true class. I had, you know, the only topic that I really remembered was about Hitler and something to do with the kingdom overall the king time the system over in England.  And really I wasn't really listening to that either because you know, I thought to myself none of this aligns with who I am or where I'm going. So one way listening to this and the teachers knew it too they knew that I was different and so they just let me do what I had to do. And as long as I played good at rugby, they weren't going to give me detention and what do you do after school?  I try to do the university thing broke and was just epically failed sure just as bad as I did at college, but it wasn't until I found my niche market after I finish my Rugby career that I went back to my people and and that I was there were many different to whom a and many different model that were calling me back to tell Marty and if there was a give back that I could operate and it was the Maori world, you know, usually as a regular played get back to the Rugby World for me. I was like, there's enough will be  Doing that, but we could I give back to our people to uplift them because being molded Brothers awesome that's amazing really is in it and the stuff that people see predominantly Park our see in the bad stats on the TVs and the media Etc and paint that picture Bree. There's none of that where I come from, you know, it's completely blows my mind, you know really does when I do see those negative stats about our people because I'm like, shuts what I don't know their world, but this is the world I know so this is the world I'm bringing  Earth I'm like, let me present this world because there's going to be more people wanting to be a part of this world then that will and so those two worlds you're referencing one. Is that the Maori who have gone away from the traditional areas, you know what I mean? Because you mentioned something about the city migration or Open Drift and drift. And is that what that is where yeah, that was the cutoff Point like mum coming from raro to New Zealand. You have to give up something to make it in this world.  Yeah, that was the ultimate sacrifice for our parents say, you know when they did move into the towns of World Trade training or was going into a sewing Factory or is all factory work. So we're all known as laborers, you know. Same thing happened in World War One World War II. We were just known as the the arse of the army, you know go in there and do the do the hard yards. Otherwise if you wanted a fight then you were going to be the e-golf fetal which is the one who goes and gets killed. So we were already sacrificed right from the start but you know, as we were one will to finish and the urban drift happen.  We lost quite a bit of our culture in that small Gap and I know that 1907 was a thornless of pressure neck where they took away and Stripped Away all of our practices when it come to you know, Supernatural powers or one understanding the vast majority of our culture through our spiritual beliefs were stripped of us and then given back to us quietly around 1965. But but that's 60 years of just hidden treasure. What do you mean like they Europeans took?  I see couldn't do your practices couldn't do any practices. They were not to be any Molly's traditional schools. There wasn't to be any practice with all of our our Master. He's so all of this is to acknowledge was totally banned from practicing any of our traditional powers or what we would willingly know as telepathic skills that we do have in our in our system anything for foresight anything from seeing the other side all of that was was banned you could have practice any of that there was also  The negative side which is considered to be like black magic all of those sorts of things that still haven't play and it's still alive and our culture. Wow, people just don't see it. People don't know where it is or what it even looks like. So we're people do see it. They're like all you know, that's a practicing Seance or you're practicing whatever the Christian world is got up for all the religious words got for it. They've got quite a negative system for it. So I would be considered a witch or wizard of a followers had a stigma about me, right and for me, it's almost like I'm trying to  You as much as I possibly can to uplift our people in the most positive ways and connect them back to the roots of where they were disconnected and and it's and it's doing a good job for our people and it's really making them see in a different light that these two worlds. They Clash they Clash like the Titans as there any what about say someone like me who, you know growing up in New Zealand may be struggling to find a little bit of identity and meaning is there some  Is there a way I can get some learning because it sounds like what you're talking about as would be really awesome to learn and be part of or is it predominantly just from Maori. Are you followers of the to work on you fellas are the elders your hours. We left your follows Islands go. So we're mum was was raised and brought up. We always honor the Pacific Nation, you know because Molly had to go through that Eastern Cape and when we did we took a lot of knowledge with us. We took some of the highest priests with us along the journey.  Which we still do acknowledge that tie which we call a thought Diana Tata is almost like a connection to the Pacific Rim. And in that we have there are many ancient stories. There were many legends that were interconnected and still now we still representing one another on a platform. But I think what people why people tend to look at the Maori world view as because we were probably one of the only indigenous cultures throughout the world  to formally write a treaty with the crowd and smartly very smartly and they even that they try to outsmart us on us being smart, but still now they're struggling with it. That's why they can't sell our assets off. That's why they can't go through any backdoor deals because they were standing right there at the front door saying hey, we're just right here. Yeah, you know, you can't do that and saying that we know we did lose a lot. We did lose a lot but we still made a big enough noise and  The impact of today's society that we are still represented a representation of all indigenous practices and just because we have our own culture here and I've dealt with it doesn't mean that you can't connect them to it. You can absolutely connect them to a because you belong to it. So we wouldn't consider you being a stranger here your home. This is your home because your whakapapa came here to and so Alpha couple came from you. So it's all into interconnected but it's may be starting back at the seed of where your ancestry fuck up about came from you start there.  Or you'll be late in this map and the map is all about finding that connection on from and sister to ancestor and you will find that in certain and sisters if you hear stories about them that you've inherited some of the characteristics that's when it gets amazing because you're like wow, my great-great-grandfather was this that makes sense because I do this and when you start making those connections, you're like man what I'm doing right now, there's no mistake why I'm doing what I'm doing. Yeah. I'm in here talking with somebody else that is on a level that you understand it they pay  Away and intent and opening up these portals for people to speak before mmm. There's nothing different from our ancestors back in 1700 stalking one of my in the Cook Islands. All right, October should say and that Altona on a moderate disputing in talking about these issues to find resolution for solutions for the Next Generation to come. So this is just a different form. We just doing it years and years you're blowing my mind had so it's cool because you know, it all makes total sense and  and it's confronting. It's confronting. I have spent a lot of my twenties.  Telling myself that the world was how it is and you got to find your place within it and from what you're saying. There's just so many deeper layers that I wonder if we try and find that stuff through those psychedelic drugs, you know, maybe that's why they're so popular now. I've never tried that stuff, but there's a part of me that wonders if  if we need help to see past the walls, we've created and Society, you know, and  but maybe what I'm picking up from you as you know, there is that kind of there is that opportunity if you work hard enough at trying to you know, trace it back and think deeply about the practices and the way people lived that maybe you can you know connect on a I don't even know what the right language should be, you know, like a deeper level like you mentioned portal, you know and trying to  See how feel it may be more than just talk about it. You know, that's a big issue. I have at the moment as we're all it's very formulaic and I want to feel something, you know what I mean? And I wonder if that's what people that keep emailing you and dming you because they want to feel something to a that's what bromine like, I think the last podcast I done it really did plant seeds and not only in people's minds but in people's hearts that what  We're feeling was an energy system through a camera that they could resonate with they could resonate with something. So powerful that Sparks off a trigger inside them. They're going to want to explore because it excites them. You know, it's like reading a really really good book. You just don't want to put it down until you get right to the end. If you read something there's just mediocre and you're just doing it just because you know, you struggled to find the reason why you're doing it, but when you're tracing ancestry whakapapa and you're hearing stories of the  The old times and the old people and they're giving baskets of wisdom. They like dropping bombs all over the show and you'll see it through we call them for the Tokyo Proverbs for that. They work you darling and when they drop little bombs like that you explore inside that you're like, okay, what did that one line mean to them their perception of it was to do this. Did it do its job. I don't know. What's my perception of it. Then I look at it and I go bang and I blow it up even more and I'm starting to see all of these Visions, you know, that's the human power that we have been taught.  You suppress no, you don't think for yourself we think for you and you just do what you're told like that was weird for me. When I went to school. Here's the context of this book read the text about a kind of read English to begin with and it alone. I'm just looking at words just like muddling my brain and it hurt but when I did this drop the book and went like that I saw this whole different world and for me, it was about exploring the potential of what is what's on the other side. What is on the other side of me think?  being here and comparing that to me thinking down there, you know, and then I look at my Parker how mites which I you know have so much respectful but they were going home to their lawyer father's the accountant mothers with big mansions and tennis courts and pools and I was going back to a village on a street where we had murderers gangsters jailbreakers glue sniffers, you know, that was where I grew up, you know versus going to stand right at my mates house and I'm like, whoa, I was like living in a kingdom, you know, and for me now,  Like, okay. What is the palace look like now for Maori didn't how do I build my Village and invite my partner made seven for them to go. Wow. I think you're already doing that. Yeah, absolutely this virtual Palace and that's that's what you're saying. It's resonating through the story a because I think we're learning the hard way that it doesn't matter how much you have. I mean it matters how much you have, but you can as soon as soon as it doesn't mean anything you just end up unhappy.  Yeah, because well you guys my mind that people who have heaps of money unhappy. I don't get that concept, but maybe a few you know, I guess if you add in the fact that if you're not working for the it's just given to you. It's too easy. That's one of those things that I wonder if  You know connect all of us humans is that we do need a certain amount of tough stuff to you. Even if it's working the land or doing something physical is it?  What what's the idea use? You have a round like physical side to you know, we've spoken a bit about the kind of mental aspects of culture to those go hand in hand physical and mental you are absolutely doing these there's another two part Series so that we've got the spiritual and emotional like the whole you know thing about being healthy is not just about physical, you know, like most people will go like I need to go to the German look ripped and look buff.  But that's quite an ego way to look at yourself. If you look deeper at that person, you'll see a whole lot of things that are going wrong with that person both mentally emotionally, spiritually. There's a whole trigger of things. So for me, I like to put them all in order like they are rows of my garden and if I'm not tapping into every single one of them on a daily basis, it's almost like a sinking ship, you know got teeth are too and I thought oh ho yo ho yo ho starts to go, you know dip down and then it gets too heavy on one side.  Things going to give you know, so it's almost about carrying that same amount of energy in every single part of those rows. So they, you know, the the give back for yourself is going to be just as abundant as the physical contributions that you put in you're going to get out and do the same one to spiritual practice emotional level going to do it on a mental level, but we all have, you know energy systems that are working and operating internally and if we get those rights externally, we're going to feel the benefits and reap those Rewards.  But if it's all about just the you know, the the muscle tone of what you carry so you can get a couple of looks from the Sheila's down the road. Yeah, it's me those great. Don't get me wrong. But you know at the same time, you know, most people can start to see through, you know, they see through all of that stuff. Once they have a conversation with you. It's like okay, you know, you've got a beautiful body or you physically look well, but you just don't have a bloody intellectual conversation in your in your brain. So it's like a holistic level a of been able to contribute to you know your  well being yeah, well, I'm constantly listening to you and trying to like translate it into a way that you know, my wisdom brain can understand it, you know, and I don't know if I'm someone like that but when when someone says to me, you know to have good mental health, you have to think about it like a gym you don't go to the gym and just start lifting heavy weights because you'll injure yourself and then my mind starts thinking well, maybe that's what you know, like a psychotic break is it's a brain injury and we either  I haven't healed it properly or something like that. So I guess when I'm listening to you, I'm just trying to think what can what can that?  The other side of me which isn't quite articulate culture and I was quite you know science driven because I can feel it. And then as soon as I start to try and translate it in my head, I lose it again and I'm wondering you know, what are some general things that you might be able to offer myself and people watching who don't come from a strong like I don't say it disrespectfully, but I didn't have the elders sharing with me. I was around them. So I have loved from them. Right and this amazing.  Kind of memories of 18 was hands and being with people and and and just having that, you know intense love from both cultures, but I don't really have a roadmap of where to go now and and I wonder what you would say to someone who's wanting to find a bit more meaning in their life and what can they do kind of today? It's really just asking the question of what do you want because really if you can sit inside that you can manifest and contemplate that  At that is putting Stillness aside for aside for yourself. So you might practice that every day for five minutes and just be still and contemplate. What do I want? No noise just absolute silence as well so that you become present with yourself and you will find that the answers will just start dropping. Yeah, and once you do that, then you need to articulate what that looks like. Okay, I want this right now. What does that look like? How do I articulate that in one sentence? What a give me three strong powerful words that represent that now then how do I  Practice that because it's in the application of it that you're going to attract. It's not just really in the thought process of it and I use this this quote that knowledge isn't power. It's only potential power but applied knowledge that is power like for me when you can see somebody applying their knowledge and they're doing something with their lives, you know to me that is someone I want to gravitate towards as opposed to somebody that's just talking like blah blah blah blah blah blah and no action behind it very hard for me to be convinced that you know, I  I follow you, you know I should be I should be really looking at you as an example of where I want to be so really it is about, you know, just spending time with yourself, but you know, no kids no work no music. No nothing just straight silence mean like if you do need that flavor of a little bit of music playing in the background just to ignite all of the fires within you so that you can get in the zone to think about that one. And from there. It'll almost direct you to the next stop. So let's just take that.  By yourself for many that freaks people out because we are trying to never be alone. That's right. It's wrong to have someone with us virtually physically even the fact if you say like I'm running it through my mind. What do I say to my wife? How did you want to be alone for five minutes to be like, what's wrong? When I do we call that's like yes, but I want to give myself permission to ask. What do I want? Yeah. Why are you asking yourself that I thought were on a mission all together? Yeah, you know, yeah, so I'm trying to  And real-time make sure that as I want to bring everyone along I want to bring you run along and not say I can't do that. I don't have a partner who lets me have time alone, or I don't like time alone because of these different things but it might be something like, you know, even if you just go for a walk, okay, because it looks like you're just walking but you can be alone to a yep. Yep. And and and for that there is there's pros and cons with that as well. Right, you know one that you're actively moving.  So everything else is moving to gotcha, so you're not still got your so there's no breath work that coincides with the way that you need to open up again. I'm going to use that word the portals for you to see what you need to see. Okay? So in the western context then I'm so there's no excuses. You could go for a walk to your local park and find a chair that normal people sit in so it doesn't feel strange to you. That could be a way to kind of get around like cause you know, I'm trying to think what where would I go? That's alone.  You know, how would I it's not I don't have I haven't really done that before. So then I start thinking of practical ways and it doesn't look weird to go for a walk when I say weird under this umbrella of whatever we live in you know before we can get strong enough because my fear is that it gets a little bit into that space of you know, but freaked out by that and I don't want to go there. I'd rather, you know, the devil we know and I'm I personally I think that's a bad system.  You know because you just going to isolate yourself more and pick stupid ideas and like the whole point of me doing this podcast is to like get good ideas practical ways that we can that you don't need a philosophical degree to talk philosophically. Yeah, that's right. It's just got to be simpler than that. So so get yourself alone and then as it just simply ask yourself. What do you want be really direct with yourself be really direct like really ask yourself.  Yourself and most times if you get out of here and go down to here it'll it'll start to work in a form of Harmony. So with your like cooled that excites me know, how do I feel about that? Well, I feel excited about that. Yeah, if I can go here's a vision. I feel excited. Let's put those together and you'll find that they come into you know, the the word that we use as form of way to ER, you know, and people say, you know, what is way too and it's hard to explain. Let's win the Intruder of waters come together. There are two waters way as water to meet our demands to  So when those two waters meet from the mind and the Heart you've created a water flow effect at the moment. So many waterfalls are can't there's hardly any water coming out, you know, then you've got to go back into your brain and go now, I've got to work back in the system go and do what the man says because you know, that's how I'm going to make my bread and butter Etc. But if you open up yourself and you're going cool I if there's a purpose and a reason why I'm here, what is that? If I can resonate with what my mind is visualizing versus what my hearts are singing for then I'm going to have a cause and effect with the intuitive Waters.  That are going to guide me into the right direction so that I can be the best version of myself really an old attract the right people. I'll attract the right people. I mean, I started this war 10 years ago, and I've only put it out now for the last two years my concept and I come into I've come into contact with so many like-minded people now I'm sitting here with you and we're now putting this platform out into the forum. We other people are going to be like, yes, I can resonate with that. I'm about that, but it don't know how to do it yet. So  Simple term is you know, the mental well-being and allowing ourselves to emotionally be in tune with ourselves by looking into it. It's about finding Stillness for yourself. Sometimes we might have to take a few steps backwards because there can be shadows lurking in the dark and what I mean by the Shadows, there are things that we are not really completely honest about ourselves and not accepting ourselves for who we are and those are certain behaviors that lie inside the subconscious mind when you do sit with yourself, they'll  bigger like submarines and black remember this and then you got to go deal with it. Right? Yeah. So in order to go forward, sometimes you'll have to go back and go who I need to get rid of the submarine because it's a nasty one sitting in my subconscious state of mind. I need to now go the into where the source in the seat of way that was planted and cause an effect of how many people I've interrupted during that process to didn't clear it out of my system so that I can move forward to my purpose. So your minds waiting for you to be alone so it can just start pop and stuff and and you're  Got to kind of if you just can't ask yourself that question because other things keep pumping in part of dealing with it is dealing with it you got to end is that sometimes like physical it can be physical can be physically taxing on you, but that's because it has mental breakdowns where you are so disconnected with yourself and that's why so many people get depressed because they can't articulate why they're feeling the way they're feeling and they don't even want to look at it. They don't want to look there that I want to  Stand it. It's just like let's sweep it under the carpet and try and move on to where the lighters but yes right there Shadows. Just going to come popping up everywhere. So unless you're me like it's like moving house hot water moving this our skin live in this house. I want to move to another house and have a better start. You just going to pick that same shit up and put it in the next house same as a relationship is going to put the same stuff up from that relationship take an initial willing to deal with it yourself and own and accept that you'll find the absolute understanding of your truth. You absolutely will but people are too afraid to go.  Like to see but sometimes it's you know, you have to build a core circle of influence that it's going to help support you like your wives like your children because they have to bring you back into a neutral Forum or into a neutral space. And these are these sort of transitions that we are not really clear about it. We're not articulating for us. We have to go into a secret space to deal with them can't be just at the dinner table when we're talking now. I mean, there's a shadow on a deal with it. Now you have to go away to a Sacred Space and being always use that same space.  Ace to go and deal with whatever you need to deal with or to create whatever you need to create or imagine, whatever you need to imagine then come back into your neutral space where your family have an understanding called dad's been through this or hubby's been through this a wife. He's been through that will bring them back into neutral form context spend time communicate again, and then there's the other side where you have to go and do your job go and putting things into action. So that's almost like a three-course meal that's going on inside your energy system to allow ourselves to be able to deal with what we needed to deal with.  And then move forward and as part of the movement you helping people on this journey. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's what Marty movement really is. It's all about it. It is healing people from the inside out and it's and it's without saying that you know, and we use all of the systems we educate people and what it is so we don't leave them empty handed by the time I finish the workshops you can apply those tools immediately immediately. There is nothing inside any of my Retreats workshops. Why not?  You want to call them that you cannot use effective immediately. So that's why people are sort of cleaning onto it go off apply it cool. Then they go and explore qua found this awesome. Is this what you thought you would do now really created this just for movement and physical base because you know, like having a health and fitness background. I thought you know, what's a cool concept that we can come up with and I wasn't getting into sessions with your Zumba make even Zumba was talking to the guy who created it the head of marketing because they wanted to do a joint.  You just remember I was like nah, that doesn't work. Your culture is our culture and you're doing what you're doing. But this is here. This is this something different going on here, but for me to put it as a commercial State, I thought to myself, you know, I love business and to me to put it on Commercial stage. I first have to go back to my own people if my own people can find access through tapping into the infinite potential on that side. Then we're growing the market through my whole deal ends in a modern world view and then that can go through and transfer it to the world. So  There is a strategy in terms of the you know, long-term investment in terms of doing the hard yards here building it into a concept where it can then become a global movement. I feel that we are going to heal a lot of people which will ultimately heal the land if we can heal the land then we're going to save a whole generation because at the moment through whom all of our high priest have noted that the world is sick at the moment very sick, and it's very out of balance, but there are programs like this that can help heal people. So people can heal the land.  Yeah on a global scale not just here and I've double as long as all Taro is alive the world is going to survive. Yeah. Now that's a given effect because we hold the sustenance in the essence of all of our gods and we acknowledge them and honor them and they're certain way very protective of it. But if you go overseas, you know just across the ditch you'll see in their waterways is just polluted smashed environments are just getting developed after oil drugs and oil this and fracking and everything. It's like it's getting a hiding so we have  after now then go back and then bring balance to it.  Do you feel pressure to maybe pressures the wrong word? Do you feel the obligation to be educating the so-called? You know lawmakers? Yep. I think then some of them are just now starting to wake up to it. And that will be driven by just this constant the sickness a yep. It has absolutely like that got to look more holistically than just, you know, zeros and ones. Yeah, I mean like, you know when you look at the  The business World everything's is about to about numbers. He they get their numbers, right? They don't really give a shit about what happens in between the zero end that the Target that thereafter and the cause and effect of that obviously is that you know, the either something's going to give and as long as they hit their target, you know, they'll sweep everything else under the carpet, but I think now that you know say we have a party in our government that are now looking at the stats of mental Wellness or mental health mental health and and there  Pumping a shitload of money into it, you know just to really get these providers on the ground to help our people. Oh you look at the budget and hand if they've if they've been allocated millions of dollars half of that is going to go to back in work, you know, that's all the researchers excetera Etc where you've got programs like us that are on the ground that have been active that are in front of people that are changing lives that are implementing values inside of families that cost put that on top of their kids. They go to school in the same thing happens. So it's this big Energy System that is being developed at the moment and it's on the ground and it's running.  you know, we're quite self-sufficient in terms of being really really clear about what our motives are and people are now starting to turn their heads about we need to go to programs like this to be able to implement this into a communal not just a little private sort of sector that's going on but a communal level and I think that the heads and the decision makers are now starting to look at you know, what's actually happening on the ground because of these ports that helps because of the suicide rates because of the sicknesses  through cancers, you know, there's there's a bigger picture stuff that's happening behind the scenes in terms of their development. Is it tough to be someone who's brave enough to look into statistics and to really because you know, there's a lot of things like now Netflix and all of that stuff that mean you don't have to really look you can just glance your eyes over that way and watch your TV shows and fart around doing what we do every day. I often think about the people who are  Yoo-hoo, you know look at bad news or look at the reasons behind things and I wonder what does that lead? You know, do you have a way to cash it out of your mind or is it holding it in there and using that as your  fire it will you have you obviously have to know your pains in order to find the accolades of where your pleasures are and you know for us it was it was put in front of us because we don't watch the news at home. So we don't have any bad information coming through our box all it is is you know, we have control over Netflix and we decided to what watch what is going to be more effective in terms of entertaining our eyes and our ears. These are really the portals to the subconscious one day when they're consuming information. They actually planting  Means when you become emotional in times of the in tune with that that's going to have a cause and effect of how you're going to consciously behave. Yeah, and so we can doubt anything to do with the news. We don't watch the news. We don't listen to the radio. Yeah, we would rather listen to a good podcast and listen to that over and over and over something that we do resonate with. We read books that resonate with us and our family and inside the core values of what that is starting to nurture. We are cultivating great minds.  Brilliant Minds and for me, it's like I've got two young Sons. What's going to be the best sort of Avenue for them to be able to enhance their mind power so that they become whatever they choose to be but have a brilliant mind about it. And so, you know, we eliminated all of those those excesses, but you know not to say that they're not out there because you just push one button on the internet and you just going to get information just like that and so it's you know looking at something that I am very passionate about but what are the Pains of that?  That I can understand. How do I clean transition that pain into a pleasure and it's because I've got a direct affiliation of got a connection with that and if I have a connection with that I'm going to want to do something about it, which means I am walking on the shoulders of my ancestors. So I know that I'm covered. I know that I am fully covered because my connection to my whakapapa says that I am destination that they are pushing me towards they believed in me and that's all I need. I don't need anybody else to believe in me, but my ancestors know that I am.  I'm I'm doing something good for my people. I'm doing something good for the world. And that's just going to keep me engaged but it does get tough. No, it does get tough. You know, sometimes I sleep for two days after a workshop because that's just drained me. Yeah, now you think about that you've got 50 people in a room where just drawing from you need it and you're just like right. Well, it's like this chat man, because I only understood parts of  You know and I think that's the beauty of when you hear things and Concepts that maybe you don't hear often challenges my mind, you know, and that's what I want. That's what I want. That's my way of contributing as to have all of these different ideas, you know, and we talked on the left on the way up, you know, like some people believe others don't and I'm I'm trying to find that middle ground. Hmm that I believe there's bread crumbs for everyone, but you  Got to have some general start places. That's why I love what you said about, you know be alone with yourself even that there's so many more things going on than just being alone. There's not being with others. There's not having influence. There's your mind throwing and things that you your subconscious that you need to work on. You just not going to get it if you don't be alone. So you don't need to believe in anything to be alone. That's right. And then who knows it will pop open and you can work on that and  you know, the interesting thing about belief is it's the one thing that I mean we all believe in something and I often think well, what does it actually mean to believe like when you talk about your ancestors, you know it I guess you're speaking metaphorically, but the idea is that they you know, when you see connected to them, it's just you you literally are right you're connected to  With DNA with memories with stories and for someone who maybe doesn't want to go further down that road of believing and you know, let's say the mystical or something like that. Is that enough or do we need to believe you know in a God I guess is what I'm asking because you know, it is tricky bird how many like, you know the and I come across this concept all the time, especially when people that enter into  To my Retreats and workshops and they've been brought up in a religious space from from your and it really challenges them. It really does and they find you know, really cringing moments for themselves when they're just like they're they're conflicted and I always say to them there's nothing wrong with you believing in what you believe in. Okay. I quit that you can that's completely up to you. That's your guided process of how you operate. Well, that's how you've been programmed. That's what needs to be fed to you in order for you to  Have I hope faith in yourself? We're on a spiritual realm. It's almost like the world and itself is is circulating around you and you're in tune with whatever makes you feel, you know, feel aligned with and belief to me is almost like it's just holding that Faith within yourself because when you believe in something that's half the job done. The rest is on the exploration side and the work you've got it in put in the work and then  Digital cupful, but believing in something that's when you don't have any belief whatsoever that you feel empty and sometimes you need to go there. Sometimes you need to go there and absolutely go there to then recognize what you need to be grateful for because gratitude is going to guide you in the right ways gratitude is going to be that significant tool for you to inherit what you need to inherit because if I'm grateful for in these clothes imagine the guy down in Auckland City who's got no clothes on and he's suffering and freezing conditions, you know, I'm sitting here.  Ungrateful because I got clothes on, you know, if I don't have Gucci clothes because that's the stigma of where the world's going to need to me. I die. I cringe sometimes at the Fashion industry because this perception of what you need to be and how to be successful is is all about the accolades of what you have not who you are, you know for me it's about, you know being connected with who you are by having belief in yourself, and that system might be guided by religious beliefs spiritual beliefs customary beliefs cultural beliefs.  You know really doesn't matter at the end of the day. Yeah, because you're always going to find the answers within yourself. That's the key a it has to be because you know, that's the conflict to is that when it becomes about yourself people say things like oh you're just self-absorbed and I have a lot of people who say, you know, you can't look after others if you don't look after yourself, and so I'd really does come back to you and you might just need to push that alone time and hey or you're absolutely right man. I  Lost one of my good mates who's like 40 heart attack just like the other night. So I went to his funeral service last night. He was given you no warning signs, but obviously somewhere along the line there was a little bit of Lack of self keas along the way or just downright unlucky or his calling was to go whatever the reasons are and whoever has those answers are up to them. But there's no need to be dying that young from ill health and it will help is a very conscious thing if you are.  Consciously aware of looking after yourself on those planes that I've already described. There's no excuse why we can't live to the 80s and pass on those Pearls of Wisdom to the to the second or third generation coming after you there's no reason why and it's some of the greatest accolades and life when you can do that put yourself on a platform where you are sitting in your Komatsu Otunga. Well, you're an as an elder feeding this wisdom into the Next Generation. It's going to enhance the power of the world, you know for me. It's a very  It's a very simple web application that we just tend to fail at the moment. Well, I'm going to go back and listen to this podcast because I'm like watching you I think of your next question the final question I ask every guest and I wonder if you know, you can take a moment to ever think I ask them if there's a moment there blew your mind that like a life-changing moment that you are okay to share and I guess I ask this because I try and encourage myself to think of those.  I meant that you know, you were one person one day and something happened and you couldn't see the world the same way. Do you have like a moment like that like a mind-blowing moment? Yeah. I record it for me from you know, one of my greatest mentors as name was doctor or the late. Dr. Nepal where he and he shape-shifted so many different lives through the world of Maori Performing Arts. No one is Kapa. Haka.  He and his platform was the stage and he was ruthless very very ruthless about his Concepts, but the belief that he instilled in every single one of us was bringing your mountains your Rivers your mother. I your tribes your ancestors your people and you will never be lost.  And by that stage, I didn't know all my mountains my Rivers my but I my sub-tribes my help with my people. I knew maybe one or two. So I went in and I dug all of them out. Wow, and I just almost felt like I was the embodiment or the river mouths of all of these Landscapes all of my ancestors and a became such a huge networking Global process built into my neurological system.  That the imprint is all inside me that on this physical plane. I need to keep this physical plane while so that I can carry on the traditions of what a great man. Then empowered me and blew my mind away. But all he did was he just opened the door? I had to walk through. What were what did you say again? They're your mountains mountains your Rivers your Mirai your ancestors your people and that's cross-cultural. Anyone could go do that tomorrow anyone could go do that tomorrow and if  Stuck start there, then you will know your story, right? Oh, gosh. Why don't I know mine brother? Thank you so much Mommy coming on the Pod novelist. We can people follow you if they want to, you know, come on book into one of your workshops or follow you on social media. Yep. I've got a couple coming up next month. I'm going to be in Manoa to region on the 3rd and 4th of August, and I'm also going to be in order.  In Napier walks Bay Area on the 22nd 23rd of August. There's an eight week program starting under a couple of my practitioners in the Gold Coast. Wow. So there's a master class program happening over there. And then we are looking over in Hawaii as well. But we've just had a call out for all over New Zealand. So, you know, it's going to be busy times ahead. But if you need to go to anything go to our Facebook page on Maori movement. Otherwise, we are updating our website at the moment to have a whole list of different Retreats that we're going to be hosting.  An old dirt or Australia and the globe www.madamebridal.com cool, brother. Thank you so much, Mommy.
Hello kids and welcome to episode 57 of the deep-fried neurons podcast. Today's episode is a like mostly Focus about digital space as a space for art and any other form of living. I know I was interested in it. I just really was which is why I sat down with an Okie who created a show about art in digital space. Hope you enjoy it and well. Yeah cue the fucking  no.  Hello children. I hope you miss me for a total of what one week. Maybe there was a doom episode somewhere in the middle. If you check out my YouTube Channel, please check out my YouTube channel is slowly there. And today we're with an Okie who is the curator of Siberia which happened at Tifa and my podcast was used to like plug it constantly so that some of you would turn up but it was a brilliant show. I must say and inoki introduce yourself to  A deep-fried neurons audience. Hi guys. This is a Nokia. I'm an architect and then I did a short course in art and architecture with New Media. And since then I've been exploring New Media with solar shows with some friendly artist with some friendly in art institutes and then I decided to do a big show of Authority for that's how the idea of Siberia.  I'm about so Siberia was curated with Tifa with the default team and it just was it was just going on this weekend. Mmm. Well speaking of which like when it comes to New Media, I just to make sure everybody's on the same page. Could you explain to our audience and mean I'm not Joe Rogan. I'm not going to pretend I know what it is.  Don't ask me Joe Rogan now that he listens. But anyway, could you explain to our audience? What what New Media consists of  So New Media has a wide range of digital mediums and form a new media currently involves all the new technologies that are coming out within the digital world. So what that that includes virtual reality augmented reality. There's also something called mixed reality artificial intelligence machine learning interactive installation with your pieces Etc. So like things which are made within the digital tool we called it, New Media.  Playground because New Media entails a huge part of interaction. So for you to be working with New Media, you have to interact with it in some ways like virtual reality or augmented reality doesn't work if it doesn't have an audience. So it interaction is a huge part of New Media. So besides the mediums it also needs to have interactivity. Okay? Yeah, so that's what is New Media. It's like I'm  I mean, it's sort of like a Sandbox this type of a deal for me. Okay, how much I forgot to ask you before we start in the pot. This is such a disaster. But how much do you game like, do you know popular gaming at all fairly not so much. I mean I've camed while my whole life while growing up but it's been very little bit like few hours a week or something like that recently because I have jumped into new me.  Yeah, I go to a lot of museums that have game exhibitions. Okay, just few months back. I was at that km in Germany which had games exhibition so they had games from the 1950s to now. So the whole Spectrum right Nintendo tell what your reality right now. My favorite game designer is David O'Reilly have you heard of his everything game where you can actually go into walls and doors.  Xander world, so the the way it works is  Suppose you are in a garden scene and you're a rabbit and you move around and you see a small ladybug. You can become the ladybug and then you walk around and then you see like a small piece of grass and then you can pick out the grass so you can play with scale and that way you can actually be everything. I mean, I think I've seen this. Okay, and I mean, I remember somebody made a series of videos on it. We're like you was first Goat Simulator than like bucks.  Later, and so on and so forth by was just the same game and they were just click beating me because I let Goat Simulator as I was a child.  I miss Coates in sorry sorry, sorry, so what I personally like with gaming is not necessarily like the levels or the game plot, but I'm more interested in scales and game environments and character designs, especially narratives. So I am I usually turn to games to try and look at these things and it's not necessarily to spend too much time and like getting all the levels right? It's mainly  Like see all these beautiful visual Aesthetics that the games have to offer and then click get back to what I'm trying to do. That's very interesting because that's your II architect of met with that tendency. I am sure like most of the people are listening to this have heard the podcast with other T. Now me and I think usually talk about gaming quite a lot because well she games. Yeah. So one of the one of the behaviors that game  developers usually reward is well exploration. So this is quite a lot of hidden items. If you complete them within a certain time frame you get rewarded extra, but if you complete all of them, you're definitely getting a lot of rewards. Yeah. So when it comes to new me coming back to New Media and how interaction is important. I feel like it's been ingrained into popular culture a lot more than people imagine it to be and  While appreciating aesthetic isn't exactly everybody's priority on the get-go. I think it sets sets up the game quite a lot. Like I think it's one of the things that that's come to Define gaming now at least two people like me. So gaming is very accessible to people of your generation or my generation or you know people who are younger and then there's a huge there's a huge gap between people who are much older.  Other than like a parents, for example, yeah, they wouldn't they wouldn't be as comfortable as for doing gaming as you and me. So actually on the second day of Siberia in the morning, we had a group of about 30 to 50 undies who came and these are entities who like to do gaming but not in the authentic video game style right now, huh? So we the whole Tifa team was here and we had to entertain them in a way of like a gaming environment and  The fun things the fun things gaming has to offer with our exhibition. So what should reality games was one thing if you've heard of Pete say well, yeah, so but but we had only two headsets right? So there were only two people at once playing but the rest of the time we made like this quiz game and most of our pieces in Siberia the exhibition were interactive so they had to literally go to each piece interact with the works and then fill out this  Analog quiz game right and but that was possible for us to do it with you media. So we were trying to combine like the old elements of gaming where you know, there's a point system and a rating system and a ranking but then we were trying to involve like the elements of New Media and it turned out to be fantastic. Like they really had a great time. That's brilliant speaking of which I mean,  It's very interesting. It's a tangent that I'm myself taking and I'll probably regret this later but nonetheless there's some there's a concept called video game literacy. So now me as a person has been gaming for most of my life. I know that wasd is walking and the mouse is gonna like move my head and show me the direction as to where I'm going. That's something that doesn't instinctively comes to people. Yeah, and that message.  With my head and I think that's the Gap that you're talking about in Siberia literally help with that because the third day I came there was somebody who is significantly older and I don't remember their age and they were playing Beat saber. Okay, and I remember that that the level of comfort that they had with that was very minimal and they were much more amazed with that than I am.  I mean the thing about New Media is that it allows you to kind of because it's a digital space right? Because video game still becomes two dimensional. They're still like dependent on this device to like move in two dimensional space even though it's three, it's 3D space but like when you eventually see it, it's two dimensional. Whereas with New Media like even the interactive installations. You have to move your whole body. You are literally even in virtual reality or in literally.  John space so the orientation kind of becomes natural so it becomes easy for someone to like maneuver in in these spaces. Like I remember someone came to me at the end of the exhibition and being like I was so amazed because I just didn't use my head or my hands, but I actually use my whole body to experience the whole exhibition, right and and the great part was there was no orientation like when you're in when you're trying a virtual  Phoebe's, there is no orientation. You don't have to tell someone that this is ground. This is the sky. You have to move left. You have to move right he or she can actually go and wherever whatever he wants. Yeah, they have like full freedom of like, yeah, so it kind of takes away this  Video game literacy. Yeah, and it allows like I think it allows more movement in general people actually played with safer and work out like that's the new thing. Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, so it's great. I think it allows a lot of leg movement and frees up your brain in a different way. I mean, I could go on a diagonal beat Seaver as well, but I'll resist the second thing interestingly that you brought up right now is space right one of the things that I  This throughout the exhibition is that a lot of the interactive what you call them exhibits they the sort of explored the entire dimension of space in a way that is unimaginable. Say 15 years ago. Yeah, or maybe even 20 years ago. So that's something I found a very interesting because a lot of the show is based around how  Technology has created this Infinite Space and it's for its for the art to explore and the first click I had which I think most of our audience has had is is because is the Matrix because the last time we saw something this big assimilation it was The Matrix inadvertently, that's the newly connection that I made. So when it comes to Siberia and the artwork that it shows it's fairly optimistic.  About it, but when it comes to like popular media's depiction of the same, they go on a tangent where it's either makes you exist n chaleur. It makes you paranoid. Why do you think that would be is that is that a space that you've explored before? So I'm pretty much aware of the dystopian ideas these recent TV shows and the movies have brought in with new me.  Yeah, right. We have Black Mirror which literally scares the hell out of people who watch it. Right? It's like we're not we're going to abandon technology after you what I mean that happened to me at least was like, this is so Twisted. It's not even funny but on the other hand, I think me because I work so closely with these new media tools. I think there is so much utopian power that these things have and there's so much immersive qualities that can be  I used to like explore different things. So that was one of the other reasons why I wanted Siberia to happen because I wanted to show the local culture that there can be a lot of good things that can come with these Technologies. It doesn't have to be like the Matrix or the land where all right, that's just you know, how it's like hyper or hypo realized version of what exists. I think that's what happens with. I mean with these TV shows which is which is fine.  Fine, which is which is what they're trying to do, but on the other hand these Technologies are very much accessible and they're very much. We're not dystopian in their authentic sense. Right? It's just what what you perceive and what you portray. So in a way that there was this need from my side to like change that and show people that that's why it's called New Media playground. Like Siberia was called New Media preview. So it's a playground you come and you have fun and I don't think there was even one audience.  Both who was like, oh I'm scared. I can't do this, you know, like there was no there was no thought about  We ordered Twisted identity that because one of them so there were three points that were the most important when we curated the show one was interactivity one was a playground like you need to have fun with it so that it's immersive and the third was perception. So we had a few pieces that make you think about future perceptions or how you see yourself in the future with these Technologies, right? And I think overall it was a very positive.  Doofus points so nobody talked about the simulations and you know, the Black Mirror ideologies. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting that you brought up the hyper reality is because that's some something I wanted to go over as we talked before we got on the podcast like John boutté yards book simulacra and simulation now John the premise is pretty simple and I mean PewDiePie did a video about it as well. So I'm pretty sure most of my audience knows because  Mostly everybody who listens to me has watched PD powered knows about PewDiePie. So the one of the concepts that the book gives Matrix is that  Eventually, if you take give something value enough it replaces what it was it derives value from select. There's a reality and there is a simulation the simulation starts replacing the reality if that's your go-to point forever and they like the one example that comes to my mind is money. So given that context do you see virtual reality as it exists? I mean, of course  And require a lot more invasion of Senses as I like to call it that sounded a little negative. I don't care so it needs accessibility to more senses. But do you see a future where reality as we experience? It gets replaced by virtual reality, I think.  I mean, I think there are people who are trying to make it happen because the current headsets that we have they are still not I mean the headsets we used were pretty good and they like they totally immerse you for the five minutes you're there, but you cannot spend a long time in within those walls, right? So like the technology and there are there are higher versions of these but the technology is not that high yet where you can like spend days or hours in in virtual reality.  Unless it's like a project that you're trying to like push yourself through they're obviously trying to do this and I don't know how the audience audiences react to it because I think there are there's still a lot louder of population that is like rejecting these digital Technologies, but there's something called mixed reality. Okay. You should like look up this company called Magic leap magic leap it.  Kind of it's trying to bring so you remember you know, how we have those Google Glasses that came out, right? Yeah, which but Google Glass was like a two dimensional like a glass or a screen that pops up with information magic leap is trying to develop these mixed reality glasses where basically it detects everything in your room and then makes that your real space and then adds a layer of digital elements on it. So like imagine if you're sitting in a room whether windows and  And then you say okay. I want to play this game and it's a shoot game right like a 1.2 game like things falling from the ceiling you're shooting people and it's like a simulation on your reality. So I think that could also be a way that the that the world progress is but  II mean I am not going to say yes or no to your question where I see virtual reality is the future or not, but I'm definitely going to tell you that yes, people are striving to make that possible because in virtual reality you have n number of possibilities since it doesn't have any physics and physics restrictions, right? So there's a lot you can do with virtual reality. So yeah, that's if that answers your question.  I mean it sort of leads me to a an interesting space of thought. Okay, because like when I first came to Diva and I was trying to explain threshold alike why things are curated into my show and well, my job was means so I was I was trying to tell her that I lived here on this website. Then I went to this website and this is where my friends live and this is where I met them. She had a lot  It took a lot of time for her to understand that digital spaces can be experienced as as places as we understand in geography. It was very difficult for her to understand the geographical context was very latent for people like me and that's sort of where I go with it because I sort of prefer this reality now to like say 30 years ago when I couldn't do that. So, um,  I sort of  want to want to get your Insight on if there is any inside on it is the is the fact that would this be a preferred way of like experiencing space at all for people. I mean, there are a lot of companies that are using virtual reality rooms to meet up and have like meetings and things like that and just a few months back. I have a best friend who lives in Vancouver and we were just talking on the phone and he was suggesting to me that we should have a go.  Children where we can hang out like imagine if it's a digital space online on cloud somewhere a 3D room. Okay that you can design with no limitations and you can walk in and like add something for your friends and leave it and then the other friend comes later whenever he can and like check it out. Right? I mean it's obviously possible. There is technology exists. Yeah that can happen. But but I think  this kind of like visual aesthetic that we are talking about at this point requires a high computing power, which is not that easily accessible unless you are like a gamer or you are like, you know, super high graphics card kind of a person unless like you you were putting money into your PC and your rig exactly getting that but on the other hand, there are easier platforms like Instagram or things like that when you can popular chef  Things that you are interested in like sending a message on Instagram so easy sharing things are so easy. Yeah, we have Instagram filters like we had an artist who made an Instagram filter where now her friends all over the world can access it. Right? It's not just a phase filter, but it's it's a fun filter and an idea that she believes in you so people can access it and that allows for communication. So I think in some ways these kind of things are happening, but I also feel that  we don't need a space space to communicate. It's more of like what we communicate on so it's like content and it's important to keep making that content. So these platforms kind of allow you to make content and that's how you talk about it. So in that way, I think it's already happening. Yeah. I mean I can I can connect some dots because we are chat. Yeah. It's a thing like I like there's people who have VR headsets who go online and meet other.  We'll have VR headsets Pikachu or like their favorite anime character. Yeah, there's also we are classrooms. Yeah, people come together and study. There's we are training and things like that. So in a more like Tech way in a more of training with as a lot of things happening where you can do it. Basically it's all on cloud and then you just have to use it but it's not it's not reached the level of Instagram in a way where you can like communicate.  Kate that easily. That's I mean, I wonder how much the generation before us thinks of this as the Brave New World concept.  Because all of this seemed very tangibly possible when I was like whenever I remember being alive, but I tell my dad about some of this these things and he's he's very puzzled. At least. I mean, I'm someone who works so who has been working so closely with virtual reality augmented reality for the last three four years and I still can't explain to my diet what it means or what it does like  Every time I have to discuss with him what I'm trying to do, I have to be with the pen and paper and I'm telling you that lasts for 5 minutes after the next the next five minutes is I'm trying to remove my phone or my laptop to show him like some videos. So like he always gets confused. What's like the connection between virtual reality or augmented reality? And I mean, it's obvious. It's like pretty confusing and I mean my mom won't even try to understand.  So I think it's pretty okay. It's like it's just what is in our generation may be in the next Generation. I have nephews who can like use a tablet when they're like less than three years old. Yeah. I mean, we don't even know what a tablet was 2003 at least item. I don't think the tablet was around when I was three. Yeah, so it's like it's just this technical advancement. Yeah good cruel, and I think that's  It's just how it's going to be. I mean, I have some gen Z friends. I mean I talk like I'm some Boomer but I have some like the friends who'd just turning 19 per se for them. It's very surprising that phones were not always like a digit like a phone is an extension of your body now. So like I see that connection very interesting and I see Siberia is this place where it really Embraces the the multiple  It's abilities that remain like unexplored and I quite like that about the show, but I don't want to not cover the rest of the things that I had planned for this. The other thing that I want to talk about is of course artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence learning in general. Now, my knowledge about artificial intelligence is binging like six hours of YouTube content, but that's it. I have nothing else on it. So what if what have you  realized from  looking at artificial artificial intelligence learning anything is that it's just Relentless trial and error and I want to know how does that change like human reality as it exists now or if any perspective that you might have come across on that I mean  Artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is is just the terminology to make basically make it work. You have to it's called machine learning. Okay. So machine learning has supervised learning and unsupervised learning and basically this is nothing but your training our data set to do something. Hmm, so  It's like it's like X Plus Y. Is that right or if x goes through why we get said so what happens if we don't know the value of y what happens if we know X and said then how do we get why that's basically what artificial intelligence does. Yeah, so if it's a game and it's like if I move one step that's X I win that said, so what do I what do I have to do in between  That's why for me to win right? So that's basically training the neural network or the machine to like understand what it has to do to win. So that's how artificial intelligence works and that's basically how we are trying to do and Achieve different things in different fields to make our job easier.  What we had a we had a bunch of artists who used artificial intelligence. So we had Works work from Jean Cogan GN Cogan is an international artist slash curator, and he's basically he basically teaches art is all over the world and his cause is called machine learning for artists. Hmm and he had sent his work neural synthesis, which is basically  Using Google's deep dream. Algorithm tip dream is something that Google made with AI where you put an image and it kind of makes it look in a very hallucinogenic deep dream. Like we're mmm Gene's work was based on that then we had another artist from Bangalore whose work with on Ganz.  I'm sorry Ganz. They're called generative advice rail networks. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so it's basically you take two images and the and the computer finds from the datasets finds a bunch of images from with from between them, like using the pixel values and connects them. So there are a lot of artists right now who are using technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning to try and create different Works. Mmm.  I don't know if this answers your question. But so there's a huge range and there's a huge range of things you can do with these things. But since it's quite new, it's quite experimental at this point and  everyone's just trying to see what we can do from it. Hmm. There was a recent book called creativity code by Markus Zusak toy. Okay, who is written how artificial intelligence is being used in different fields in different creative Fields. So math music art games. Mmm and where it's at and what and it's a very simple book like anyone who would want to know anything.  About it can read it and like understand it very easy. So yeah, I'll try to link a leave a link in the description so that the kind of but then they've heard the name. So yeah, they're fine. It's interesting that you this is a tangent by the way, okay at this point, but it's interesting that you bring up the way machine learning works like you brought up the three-dimensional coordinates XYZ and the Machine knows what x is it's found out why is now it needs to find Z and that's exactly how it learns or like it has the to Concord.  Donuts and like it's not it's not coordinates because it's not a space thing. It's just a variable. Yeah if they are variables. Okay. Yeah, I mean space is just an example where I was employing it to understand it. Yeah, but it's variable in any case. Yeah. Okay. So I did an episode which was all by myself after reading. I don't remember that that book.  I think it was life 3.0. I don't remember the author's name. It's quite an interesting book. I highly recommend that you read it. It's so it sort of in a tiny part of the book that they talked about humans being replaceable and because of like if you look at it the solipsistic way of life or for people who prefer to call it insultingly the  Just way of life it sort of becomes clear that you simulate what you process. So I just wondered same question comes up in the in the say in the previous episode that would machine learning ever is machine learning probable to go far in the near future to a place where the it can simulate or very accurately predict human behavior.  So again, I don't know yes or no, but just to tell you where we are at that's good enough. Yeah, so I'm currently reading Ian Chang's book. It's called emissaries of welding or something similar and basically I'm Chang is this artists who talks about creating artificially simulated worlds. So now the technology with AI and machine learning allows us to create world.  Where you can simulate everything so the past the future the present you can give it parametres like what you learn from your past how you move into the future similarly to how a i nml works, right? So you can create these simulated worlds and you can actually there are games already existing where you can see that it's a world and it's there's a character and it's playing it's just living its life. You don't even have to do anything. You can just literally just watch the screen.  And it continues to play this game and it's basically a simulated world. So now we have that technology where we can create simulated worlds and we can like literally be God's right because until now we didn't have the power to create like entire worlds and there is a rumor that we are probably living in a simulated world like the big companies Elon Musk. For example, I've heard is trying to work on this and to figure out whether the weather  We are living in a simulated world or not. I mean the answer yes or no. I don't know but we are already creating like artificial worlds. They might not be living elements. They're more like synthetic agents at this point. But I mean that's where we are at right now. So the possibilities are endless. I mean, I remember watching this like the interview that you're talking about where Elon Musk was asked about are we living in a simulation and he like he  Teased about find he's trying to find that out. Yeah, like funnily enough that related meet directly and I'm not even joking. This is the first thing that like lasted into my brain. It's cyberpunk 2077. It's because that's the that's the entire mood of the game, of course the stylizing and all of it is a very big part of it. I don't imagine cyberpunk without  the punk and The Cyber mixing together style-wise. Yeah, but a lot of a lot of how that that game has been received in the in the popular corners of the internet is answering the same exact question to what extent is reality simulated and is they're finding out to that. Well, probably not but the good thing is I learned quite a lot about where we are right now, which is much closer than I  Actually, I mean, I don't think anything changed for us whether the answers yes or no, like it's not like besides knowing the fact that like if we were living in a simulation, what are you what are you going to do about it? Right like it's not that your life. And I mean it always reminds me of that Rick and Marty episode where he creates the simulated world to like fuel his engine. Oh, yeah, you know, it's like okay we all are working to fuel Rick's plane engine, but like it's not that the  Life-form overall ends, right? So I mean that's the way I think about it. I mean I definitely would like to know whether we are living in a simulation or not, but I don't think it kind of changes. What I would do on a day-to-day basis. I mean also like you can mate again is one of those one of those shows that really enjoys making me paranoid. Yeah, and I'm like, I don't think that's even a joke because I think Justin Roiland that's his name read the Creator. Yeah. He was a mean review with Elon Musk.  Care and like at some point. I was sure that this would definitely enjoys making me paranoid. There is no other way. He makes this show so even within that show the last dude the world within the world within the world when he comes to know that he's powering somebody else's car batteries who's powering their car batteries like they come they come up like he just looks at it he gets into the vehicle and he  Like kills himself. Yeah, I wonder if that's sort of an Impulse that people possess is why does like do you think reality has that much of a value in human cognition or do you think is is that a question worth addressing I mean reality does have a huge power in human cognition. The reason people start feeling giddy in virtual reality already is because your brain already knows that this is not real.  Right. Yeah, you know it's like your brain knows and it starts sending you all these signals and then you know that this is not real and that's your body's just reacting to it. So, I mean, I think it would it would have a huge impact because it kind of changes everyone's belief system. Right? Like we live in a universe. We have a Milky Way and blah blah blah. I'm like imagine if I mean, I don't know where the range of the simulation is, but it would obviously  affect a lot of people I'm I mean, so probably if Elon Musk even knows we're in a simulation. I don't think he would like to close it that easily, right?  That's true.  Yeah game mechanics. Would that be unfair the developers will let them do that. Never mind. The point is so so there's also something like speeds on the topic that were on simulated realities and AI so the culture that I see specially in the the people my age is that the very casual about accepting the fact that they're living in a simulation. Okay, at least  Part of them not all of them but a part of them. So the reason I bring this up is because one I want to plug this video as heavily as I can. He's I think it's called a critical review of a real world and he just looks at human history and what we know about the universe as game mechanics Okay, and like how going to space was a cheat code and let like that sort of thought process sort of draw.  Let me into into a space. It's sort of connected Siberia to my to my mind as well like this link account because  Like the strange has always been portrayed as threatening as we saw in like black metal, but at the same time there is a fair bunch of non-threatening absurd that you experience. Yeah, and it's just great that we found it.  yeah, I mean that was a big part of the idea of Siberia because  I mean, I think that a lot of people who still are scared for example to use Virtual Reality. Yeah, if you see jeans if you saw genes work who's done it with artificial intelligence. It looks so beautiful. Yeah, it looks so beautiful that cannot be dystopian. And anyway, so it kind of I think it kind of at least open doors in the eye minds of people that not necessary all technology is bad because there's still a lot of people outside who would like your artificial intelligence or like  We're going to be taken over by robots are like machines or whatever. You know, we also had two films by two artists which talks about a story a narrative from the machines point of view. So like what happens when a machine gets Consciousness and what do they feel about it? Right? So we are already reaching this the idea was we are already reaching this point where we have empathy for the computer for the technology found the machine and that was like kind of the diluted idea.  That I try to put in with Siberia that let's not try and reject everything. Let's try and keep the fun parts and like let me try and remind you of how much fun there is with these Technologies because the minute you start rejecting it. It's like it's just gonna haunt you more and more let's accept it and let's like blend with it and let's be a part of it. Okay. So now done with the questions I had lined up with Siberia and Siberia related work. Okay. The next one is something I find interesting.  It's from anybody who works in the Arts field, especially when it comes to interactive Arts here and this is probably the most interactive installation set of the solutions of cell seen in a long time. Yeah, so when it comes to interaction how like how much control do you insist you have on something that you created or something that you are putting forth for interaction?  That it wouldn't work without interaction. Okay, just so like for example, we had we had about three completely interactive works. Like I mean completely full body interactive works. So one was Nest by all my for example, which was a floor interaction. Yeah, so you had to literally move like move your whole body from one spot to the other for the thing to work if you if there wasn't anybody it would not function at all.  It would not be an artwork. The second one. We had was Monsoon by artists I that to it's basically a black room and the minute you walk in the the interaction kind of triggers the generator God. So when there's nobody there's it's just a black chrome. It doesn't qualify as an artwork, right? We had another piece called out of focus by this artist called up in of Mishra. Oh the the layers one. Yeah this one, right?  So if there's nobody there's nobody triggering it it wouldn't work. So interactive art work is completely based on human input. I mean our are not just give context to where I'm coming from Tokyo as to how much control do you imagine having over what you created is so like I'll start with a simple one really go to a example that's closer to our current scenario. Okay. The example that I want to start with is Pepe.  Pepe the frog is a meme that started like I think 10 maybe 15 years ago. Okay 20 2007  Okay, fine doesn't matter and 2015 it had it reached its peak. Okay, and after that it had to be declared a Nazi symbol by 2018. Yeah, so in the when how Pepe started was a comic book comic artist somebody who just draws Comics made a frog who his friends were in school and get stoned with? Okay, and the the picture that went viral is that Pepe likes to pull his pants all the way down when he's peeing.  Okay, and somebody else will be what why do you do that? It's like feels good man. And and then Pepe sort of became the face of descent. Okay to the to the point that in the Hong Kong protests Pepe was the symbol of dissent against the Chinese government and but before that that was Pepe being reclaimed before that 4chan made Pepe the symbol of Nazism and anti-semitism.  And pepe well, it's a big Pepe lower this Pepe coin. This is how does this connect interaction? Hmm. It's interaction because he created this to be to be seen as just a friendly Stoner. Okay, who was then allowed for the internet to be used as a meme so that they could express themselves and then it just went way out of hand to the extent that he published a comic book where Pepe was  Inadvertently killing himself. So because he eventually got tired of how Pepe was being used and it really ached him to have Pepe be the symbol of Nazism at some point in history. Now the second one that comes closer to our interaction one is say C is go chat.  Now when she is go chat was use the created it was for gamers to take themselves very seriously and play a game with like super serious tactics where you could like tell each other where your friends are hiding whatever whatever, but eventually it was used for like 10 hours Loops of Country Roads or just swearing at each other. Okay, so that's why I asked why do you like? Where do you draw the line as to how much you're okay with?  What you created as a tool?  Is that this question making sense? Like how far is your realm of interaction of humans with your tool or your installation or your art? Okay, like the examples you've mentioned for me. They don't qualify as interactive. Uh-huh. Because like I said before interactive work in sis or like doesn't work without human input and  Usually it's Movement Like physical movement. Okay, so it's it's a little bit close to reality. Whereas like Pepe the frog or the Cs chat. It's still a very virtual thing, right? Yeah. It's just it's just a watcher like movement or virtual Communication in a very right. There are a lot of like you can say interactive web pages interactive games like online that you could  could come together and play or  Sing for example what our psyche like this game. That was the elemental.  It was this online game where you could invite your friends and play together. Mmm doesn't matter but I think those those don't qualify interactive art Works include physical movement like okay, it has this dimension of reality and like spatial movement. Okay. So spatial becomes a very important aspect because Pepe the frog and the Cs chart is still very virtual. Yeah, chill and  Benjamin cook what? I think that's all we have for today. Okay.

Hello everybody, welcome back to the PC gaming show live on Twitch at television, I'm your host James Davenport. What's today October 7th with me is we got Joanna Neely's Hardware staff writer. How are you Joanna? I'm doing Glory ready to  Talk some Diablo in OverWatch. Heck. Yeah, and then we got Tyler wire Tyler. Tyler. Wild executive editor. How are you Tyler? How's it going? Pretty good?  An early show. Yeah, I was going to say I haven't warmed up my mouth yet. Apparently I yeah, yeah. Yeah. This is going to be sort of our new time slot. It's not locked in yet because we got to find out what like best fits into our schedule in terms of prep and all that jazz, but this is kind of just like a, you know, a first run at it. We'll see how it goes. But it's gonna bring a whole new attitude to the show the morning slot. You know, we've all got our coffee. We're all sort of inhabiting.  We're not we're not dead tired quite yet or worn out from the thus Louvre or early morning news and Twitter reading. We're refreshed and feeling nice and ready to take on the day. It's a real it's a new optimistic washed out by the sun heats up Ken PC Gamer show. So not me. I'm gonna dark horrible cave dungeon. Well, you know, we got it. We got to play to The Stereotype a little bit and  hide in our basements. Yeah so show today for anyone who's sort of been away who typically only watches us on Twitch or video format doesn't listen to us on iTunes or Spotify or wherever else you listen to podcasts pretty much the same show, but we've introduced a new segment the news quiz. So look forward to that have I talked about what we're going to talk about today?  It's BlizzCon. BlizzCon happened. A lot of happened in BlizzCon. We're going to talk about Diablo for that got announced. We're going to talk about OverWatch to that got announced and you two were there you two were at the BlizzCon.  So that Trudy BlizzCon. Yes, the BlizzCon I went to a different one. I went to this knockoff BlizzCon. Oh, no, it sucked. I told you to watch out for those scams Tyler man. They get you down in Anaheim. Tyler will learn someday maybe and then we're going to wrap the show with some early impressions of Red Dead Redemption to S PC version which launched Tuesday no, Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday.  It's been a weird week and I've been playing that for review. So I have thoughts I have thoughts and I'm sure the internet has thoughts if you if you haven't already been aware, it's it's not the not the smoothest. Smooth was launched for Rock Star when we start with highlights the week and highlights of the week or just anything at PC gaming that stand out to us, whether it's something we played some that we read or something we saw.  Saw heard talked about that we can relate back to our ha being with we think is worth sharing. So why don't we start with who wants to go first? I'm just gonna throw it to you guys want to share  I've been playing my first Auto battler your very first Auto Battle. I'm so proud of you. How is that? Yeah, it's fine. I'm talking with the Hearthstone Battlegrounds mode, which it's super weird that they would name it that because it also kind of has the same like player unknown Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Yeah, it's bizarre, but it's I didn't really get what they were all about because I don't play DotA  Do or league so I figured out it I would not be able to understand any of those but I do know Hearthstone fairly. Well, I guess it's actually fun. It is I don't know it's addictive. It's pretty slow the the pace of it. There's a lot of sitting and waiting for a timer to run out, but I don't know it's all about  The sense of anticipation you have when you come back you set up a good combo and you don't know who you know, you don't know what's going to be on the other side of the board. I kind of understand how well I understand a Hearthstone works. I've played it. How does this like exactly breakdown and translate into? Yeah Auto Butler format. It's eight players you start with a recruit phase where you can spend gold to buy minions to put on your side of the board.  You can also use your your hero ability, which is there going to be varying. Once like I don't know one of them gives all your minions a thing where they die, they'll someone a 1 1 million in their place some of them mess with the tier structure of the minions, like giving you access to higher level minions earlier this, you know, lots of different ones. But so you put you buy a minion right? You put it on the board. This is  Round one you have three gold the minions always cost three gold throughout the game. You put it on the board. And then you're you know, you're matched with another player and your minions fight each other. And if one player has any left standing at the end of the fight those minions help your hero deal damage to their hero and you know last one standing wins. So it's pretty simple early on you just have a few minions of varying power fighting each other.  There but later on you'll have a full board and they always attack left to right so you can set up all kinds of combos. Like, you know, I can have a Mac on the right side that gains health and attack every time another friendly Mech dies and then cover the left side of the board with stuff that summons Max, you know, so that by the time it gets to my guy on the right.  You super powerful. There's all kinds of like interest in combos. You can set up. The other thing you can do is that during that recruit phase you can play cards that like give cards stat boost. Okay, and anything that happens in that recruit phase is permanent, you know, the way the board looks as you've set it up during that phase is the way it will look after the fight. When you come back your minions don't actually die. They come back and whatever so you can end up with like a guy with  60 attack and 60 Health by the end of it  usually someone just emerges with a  pretty pretty quickly with a super dominant board. You can kind of tell who's going to win halfway through sometimes but you know, you never know. I had some I won once and it was just congratulations. I had a lot of random summons I think in there and I got lucky with what what I happen to someone so cool. I mean, it sounds like an interesting variation of  All of the I mean the existing game, maybe not I guess the word I'm hearing is that it's not like this big kick in the pants. This is probably not going to be a phenomenon in the same way that team fight tactics and for a while under Lords underworld don't know whatever the DOTA 1 1. Yeah, it it helped me understand the appeal of those games and why they're addictive.  It's just exciting seeing you know, what you're going to get in. The next round is it you know, that minions is perfect for my strategy and then watching it watching it play out. It's like it's like setting up like a Rube Goldberg machine and then you know watching it all I'll work or not work. But yeah, I feel like it's seen a lot of the strategies that there are now after displaying it for two days. So no don't know if it's going to be  Quite as big a deal as those games.  Right on. Well, actually I can tell you right now it's not hey, but you know, like if you want to play something a little with a different pace and Hard Stone's kind of your main squeeze then what the hell? Yeah right right now to get in you need to either have attended BlizzCon bought a virtual ticket or pre-order. Okay, the next Hearthstone expansion. So this is what this is a beta technically then yeah. This is like some closed early access and then open Beta. Thanks. Yeah, cool.  Work more ways to do the cards always always down for that Steph Joanna. What's up in the grabbing your attention my rolled a lot of different things kind of so last night. I started finally short a plane after party, which is the latest game from night school and they did oxen free and basically your two best friends and you go down to Hell  And it's one big party and you have to outdrink Satan and shenanigans ensue. Basically, it's pretty and still has that, you know, like kind of dark slant like oxen free had but it's a lot more humorous very similar. Like the the dialogue system is pretty much the same. They still have like the same like talk Bubbles and the from everything else. Yeah. I really like that.  System. Yeah, yeah voice acting and dialogue itself is just absolutely incredible. Just like the first game so I'm not very far into it. But I am immensely enjoying it. I also Monday like kind of right after BlizzCon flew up to Ian Maxis and I unfortunately can't talk about anything about what I played until next week, but got some  Time in with the upcoming Sims 4 University expansion. So it's all I could say is good. It's good. Yeah, they'll be a preview coming for that Monday. Once the Embargo drops at 8:00 a.m. So I'm excited for everybody to find out how cool this expansion is Monday Monday. Yeah.  And then I'm what else would I dunno for an article for the mag went back and played a game from 2000 2001 called Sim coaster. I forgot how much fun that game is and how often all the guests just they puke everywhere. I remember the sidewalks just being plastic covered in vomit and they janitor strike and then the kids said enough stink bombs and letting trash.  Cans on fire and then the security guards come and they literally stuff them in sacks like big burlap sacks and they'd shut them out of the park. Yeah. Yeah, so that's what's been going on like the last week in my world a lot of and of course was called to but yeah a lot of a lot of different things good healthy spread there for my highlight, you know, I  I'm in this like posts disco Elysium depression where nothing's really grabbing me, but that's okay. Like I'm glad I'm I'm just sitting with what I played and really liking that just reflecting and it's a rare in this bill. I guess modern culture and the fact that it's my job to kind of sort of be up on the new thing all the time Pastor James we need. Yeah. I know we need to respond.  It's been nice to just kind of sit with it and reflect the light and it's a game that I think invites a lot of reflection and recounting. So that's been good. But it kind of compelled me to look into some of the influences and of disco Elysium and the developer on Twitter conveniently posted a thread of just like here's a lot of Art and here's a lot of literature that inspired this game. And so I picked up  the city and the City by gosh. I don't know how to say the name.  The city and the city Tyler you probably know this author China mieville navel. Yeah, maybe yeah yesterday in the city's good. Yeah. I'm good author. Yeah, pretty pretty darn good out. I've read some other stuff by him and this guy knows how to  Really lay down the impression of history and and history of of politics and culture without just the sitting at the first first thing I thought of when a when I started playing no interest in Elysium. Yeah. Definitely. I mean it I mean, it doesn't start the exact same way with with a hangover but it starts with a murder. Yeah detectives, you know in some sort of I  I'm still the settings still unfolding to me and I have not done a lot of research into what this is about. But the setting is also very like near future sorted grimy somewhere in Europe on the edges of Europe, you know, easy to see easy easy easy to see the influence there and I'm enjoying I'm pretty early on but it's nice nice to read member that it's pretty cool. That's my light of the week. Otherwise, I've been playing read Dead 2.  To and we'll get into all that will get it all it's that's that's its own because sort of emotional roller coaster before we dig into the bit main topics. Why don't we so the news quiz? And I don't think either of you have done the news cool, you know did not know there was a news quiz until right now. So news quiz is basically my ripoff news quiz from all the other shows that do news quizzes where I take a thing that transpired and  PC gaming news and I take a word out of the sentence and you have to use your brain to either context clues or just preternatural like knowledge or just maybe you already know what the answer is and and tell me what that blank is.  So you can really get started start I make up the points and I choose the winner. So do your best I guess but also we're show me a little respect along the way. I don't wanna hear no back talk. I'll try all right really competitive at trivia. So babe. All right, here we go. All right. Let's see who wants to go first. I guess I'll do it. All right.  Right. So I put these in an order. I don't like try and pit you against the questions that will challenge you the most okay, but we'll see how it goes.  Blank got some new Mass effect's theme skins for N7 day. And and this is a different game blank. Got some new Mass Effect theme skins for N7 day.  Yeah, that sounds like a game that I don't play Mass Effect skins what? Hmm.  Q Jeopardy theme song no, I have no idea Tyler. You want to come in for the swoop? Yeah assume that's Anthem. It is Anthem Anthem got some new Mass Effect theme skins for n7n seven day, including a new Shepherd Shuffle emote. So the game the where you're you're in the little robot things remember that game came out earlier this I should we should go back in there. Just see what the mood.  Sliding you know, I feel like I haven't heard of that's the first news about Anthem. I've heard in weeks. Yeah, probably a lot of like dumpster fires and looting. Well, I mean, it's eluding game that this question for Tyler blank becomes a excuse me blank becomes a Borderlands three style Liu shooter with this new mod.  I believe that would be doomed. Yeah, there's a new mod called border Doom that adds randomize loot drops Shields with their own capacities and recharge lates and some fun stuff to make do make compulsive lizard brain fun time. Do you think that's it's you think it's like a statement. Are they making a they make an appoint with it or do bills? I don't know. I read it. Is that yeah.  Want to play it just so yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's got XP what it does. It makes me no no just randomize stats for the guns. But yeah, I don't know. I think you can read into it. Either way have a lot of thoughts about it myself, but it's interesting. It's interesting and maybe a new way to experience that game if you want to. All right. Next question The Witcher the Netflix series The which are on Netflix liens.  More towards blank than fantasy according to the visual effects supervisor. Like that would be horror. Yeah, it's gonna be yeah, it's gonna be spooky a visual effects supervisor. Julian Perry said that there's a lot of very unpleasant stuff going on in girls World, which it makes me happy to hear you read the books or play the damn game. I think that's like some of the appeal  It has that really Stark gross grimy. Yeah, I think he stuff. I understand how visual effects can lean toward the more horrific. I don't really understand how a visual effect can be more or less fantasy. I think Sparkles. I know what you're saying. You're saying color. I think like the common understanding like we're reading into like what fantasy means to people now as opposed to like what it literally like,  Actually me game address their visual effects a way to Fantasy. They had dragons flying around those out of here and then there's things like you got fan it yet different subgenres of fantasy. And then there's Dark Fantasy and then there's horror and really kind of the only difference between any kind of fantasy. Genre and horror. Is that horror like all hope is gone. There is no hope or as even a dark fantasy. There's still a teeny bit of hope that something is going to  Not okay. So that's really the dividing line of a looking forward to it December 20th right for we going freaking vacation. Thanks a bunch Netflix. Yeah, it's going to binge that games you have I think I was like gung ho about it. That's all the date. I was like, yeah, watch them all on one point five speed. Yeah. Get your your take up a good fight scenes next question for Tyler.  Dark Souls modders have added the first blank into the game. This is a - he's been around a while and just now they added the very first blank. I feel like I know this now go into the news page here. I was people. All right. Lucky me, huh? I'm slacking Dark Souls monitors have added the first what would be a first I mean people have put  Fidget Spenders in that down could they possibly not have thought of yet? It was more of a technical limitation or a logical programming problem. Yes, our first unfair I I don't know. I don't remember. Yeah, I remember the story. So I'm annoyed. Can you repeat the question Alex? All right, Dark Souls modders have added the first blank into the game.  All right, you guys don't know it. Yeah custom map they added. Yeah, it's there's been you can go read the story but it was a big Tuffy getting custom maps into the game and a big problem had to do with like how Collision meshes or something or baked in and and yada yada, but I thought I'd assumed that had already been done. So, you know I did too and I saw the headline was like, oh well shit guess not and the very first map they added was half-life's Crossfire.  Appropriately enough course, of course. Oh next question the very the very first Red Dead Redemption 2 mod turns Arthur into what?  Oh Mickey.  God I want to say Thomas the Tank Engine, but I know that's not that's a good go-to for my life. I've no idea. Look I'm not typing either. Look my hands are right here Tyler. You're a your kind of your kind of like left-of-center all kind of cultural bad boy some kind of wondering if I'm guessing that you know, this it just from heart.  Um, I don't I remember the story. It's okay. It's the first mod for Red Dead Redemption to yeah. I remember it came out before the game was even available and we weren't sure how that yeah. I don't know that works either. I don't know fucking well justjust think of the cultural Zeitgeist because it's it's the Joker. It's the Joker.  Oh in the very first Red Dead Redemption to Mahdi just paints them and it's the Joaquin Phoenix style. I remember seeing it now. Yeah, they totally live in a society there. Yeah. I mean that's kind of what the whole if you if you've ever played Red Dead Redemption to spoilers, but it's basically the plot of The Joker so it makes sense same thing. I'm just kidding. I don't I haven't seen the Joker. I haven't either I can guess what it's so good.  Some stairs and I think that's what it's about. It's about how he comes to realize that he can dance to dance on the loves to yes and somebody recently put that the clip of him dancing on the stairs. But put over a Cialis commercial. Oh my God. Alright, that's pretty appropriate. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, beautiful. Alright next question. Let's get through this.  Where is it? Oh, yeah, Microsoft, Japan proved that a blank or posits. I don't know proof posits that a blank day work week is better for everyone. This one's to me, right? Yes. It's for it's a four-day work week. Yeah. So Microsoft Japan, I think they tested it out or yeah recent trial by Microsoft. Japan has demonstrated that not only makes employees happier, but also increases productivity as much as 40%  Interesting tip things off Tim. Where are you? Tempting? Yeah. Yeah. He's a gaming news don't stop is the problem. Yeah, we can dream. All right next question popular Fortnight YouTuber phase Jarvis was permanently banned for what?  Using an Aimbot. Yeah, and not just like discreetly but literally is the subject of one of his videos. This is a guy with nearly 2 million subscribers. He's a youngster. He's like a 17 16 year old kid and one of the subject of his videos last week was using an Aimbot on Alternate account epic has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to this thing and it's kind of its kind of nice to see it enforced across the board even too.  Figures of influence influencers, you might say children children. It's a No-No this guy used it argued that he was using not using to compete in a competitive mode, but we'll still using it in a public match which is competitive to the Casual player. You know, it's still getting peed on people's experience. Yeah band band for good how you enforce that  I don't know. I guess I guess he can't make videos about it. So it'll be hard to sneak one in interesting could be tough. Yeah. All right, let's get through these Kojima Productions is going to start making what Tyler movies but it's are making movies and I look I disagree with that headline it movies. Yeah, ha ha ha. Yeah. I'm hearing rumors about death stranding having some two-hour long cutscenes. Yeah, which way  One thing that's good thing itself is a movie. I'm sure it's very interesting to play but there are movie length. Yeah cut scenes in it are there so can you can't call it a cut scene at that point like it's a movie. Yeah back to the game at that point the gate to cut game with that's true. Yeah. So this is a quote from a BBC documentary about death stranding hideo. Kojima was quoted as saying  the future Kojima Productions will start making films if you can do one thing. Well, then you can do everything well and I don't know about that true. Is that true? If that's true then I think I'm gonna good place. I think like yeah, theoretically know like if I could write well, okay, then I should be able to math as well. Like I could do calculus but that is definitely surface truth because I can I can their hips  I think it's probably the translation thing there or at least there's some context missing where you know, he's probably talking about like within the realm of game's visual Media or and you know, of course cinematic. I mean, I'm more interested in that in a way. I mean, no that's trending looks interesting to me. I just don't know.  I'd rather watch a two-hour movie. I feel like I don't know if I want to think how many hours does it take to get through death stranding. I haven't read like I've been avoiding the discourse me to you did all that stuff. You gotta just because and it's still getting through my my filters, but I want to play for myself and make up my own mind and then play it I'll play it when it comes to PC next year and everyone's done talking about it. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's kind of weird like Red Dead Redemption to and  Trying to write find an angle about to read about this on the website. But like Red Dead Redemption to is coming out almost a year after the fact, it's been I played it back when but it's been interesting. It feels like such a quiet. It's a huge game for the PC, but it feels kind of like a soft. Everyone's kind of got their opinions out already we've talked about  Every have to throw a you know, an opinion out of left field Adam blow their mind. So she off to think of a new angle. Hmm. What opinions are there left to have any way it was it was a desperate here called Duty Modern Warfare is getting blank more maps according to a leaked.  Essence mine. Yeah, ah the Call of Duty expert. Oh, I know right always like Call of Duty. I don't know. I'm just going to throw out a number. We're going to say 12. Wow. Why don't you multiply that by 3 and add 2 because this leak alleges I can't is that the team's I cant I cant math with I can because I'm good at it. Well, what am I good at shit? I think I'm good at anything. So maybe I'm starting to realize actually, I don't think I am.  Anything so that's why I'm not if I were good at one thing while takes yeah, according to this leak. I don't know. This is a 50 or something. It was a crazy huge number 38. Yes, 38 Maps. There's a whole catalog to pull from so it's not like too wild I suppose but I don't know lot of map seeing that out of context and think about other games like well how many Maps is too many Maps though?  I feel like too many.  I don't know. I like that like at what point is your Mastery sort of spread out who thin seeds, you know, you have to know the maps. So yeah so well to play so they only keep you know, a handful and rotation which which I like hmm, I wouldn't want to be like on one of you know, 40 Maps or something at any given time, but hey content I need more.  Yeah, no, I always need more my cat. I don't know if you guys can hear as my cat is like thinks I'm talking to her when I do the show. So sometimes she like talk back to me. It's running all around. Anyway, if you hear any and her Mao is really disconcerting and strange and it sounds like a cat that's being strangled. So if you hear the sound of a cat being strangled, they're very happy and safe and healthy. Don't worry last question valve and  blank are rumored to be developing an AR headset that's alternate reality headset so valve and another company and another company. There are a couple companies besides valve. So yeah, I think there's two or three am of yeah, I heard about fourth one in the works. But well, I feel like it wouldn't be Microsoft because they got their own thing going on.  Sony I don't know no Joanna, do you know this you don't know? Yeah Facebook no apple apple. Oh interesting, huh? Yeah. So according to a report from digit times apple and valve have teamed up to develop an AR headset and  Could be released as early as the second half of 2020. It's kind of interesting. I think like if you're going to team up, I don't know like valve has been doing the R&D for this stuff forever and they can afford to do it forever because steam is weird Backwater Market where people just clean up their money and see us go transactions, maybe not anymore and they also saw a lot of games and do other things. So yeah, it would make sense that.  At Apple rather than I suppose.  Then I guess they also have the capacity to start up their own thing and but you know tap into valve and yeah, well I'm eating gummy. Like I said Microsoft has its own a our project. So I guess if Apple wanted to compete with that buddying up with valve would would make sense given they have the best and most expensive consumer VR headset actually not the most expensive. There's really dumb stuff you can buy but yeah Half Life 3 come to iPhone.  Bright how God but I mean, it's Apple so, you know their headsets going to cost like three three times. It's gonna be and not and not and not be as good. So I will not be of the social class that is allowed to use this made for the job. I can taste what it's like to fly. All right, let's move on to next subject. Let's talk about Diablo for you guys were at whoops. I almost moved the entire frame out of the way. Y'all were at  On over the weekend busy busy fun time. I think I think I don't know. I think Diablo for is the big one writes the big big one. Yeah. I mean, obviously it depends who you are at the show. I talked to people who were just like all they cared about was World of Warcraft. Yeah people all they cared about was OverWatch to so a lot of people go to that show and their fans have one game not just general blizzard fans. You have to talk to people who are like, oh I don't care.  Diablo for I see the WoW expansion, but that before interesting new. Well, okay, I think at first glance is that trailer and the trailer. Yeah, the way they opened up talking about it's a return to a darker tone and Lilith is born out of this beautiful like gross skin Cape that covers the entire wall. Yeah. Yeah, really really cool / cape and  Joanna you're working on a sort of a lower symbol symbolic. Breakdown. Yeah. Yes. I am. Yep. I'm giving too much away just comparing kind of lillis lure so far in the Diablo series from to bleeding over into for right now, but then looking at kind of, you know, especially the the student the symbolism of  Freeze in the trailer and then relating that back to the symbolism of threes and a lot of mythologies and religion and did ended up falling down a rabbit hole last night doing research on Lilith in Jewish mythology and folklore and ended up learning a lot of interesting things. So was am able to piece together. I'm a lot more subtleties in the trailer to actual historical or that's been around for like right over millenniums.  So it's yeah, you're the go-to for this because you're sort of the horror that but I think you're a true horror nut. Like just just Bonkers free stuff, right? Yeah. I am. It's a lot of fun to look into some time this week sometime soon today. It's almost done Tyler. I'm going to pass it to you once I'm done with it. So we but I think just surface level.  How do you guys feel because the trailers one thing and then like we saw gameplay afterwards and it's definitely like a Tyler and I you and I had a discussion on the website about the return to Darkness so to speak and that was in the marketing and they like their opening statements was a return to a you know, a grimy or darker the grammar darker roots of the series you think that holds up or what does that actually mean in practice true of the art style with yeah.  Three took war after World of Warcraft. I think it was just kind of a cleaner look to as much grimier, you know lots more skulls love but it's you and I talked about the UI hasn't really changed. Yeah, I mean it has with the basic elements of like, you know enemies couldn't get a red outline when you Mouse over them. It's not quite as dark as Diablo 2 was like literally dark. There's a little more ambient light.  You know damage numbers pop up enemies, there's big particle effects and you know a nice little mini map and Quest tracker. I think Diablo 2 part of what made it feel. So oppressive is that you just had you know, when you're in a dungeon, you just had a little circle of light around you right and it was literally black outside of that unless there was a torch so this isn't exactly a return to that. It's still like a really slick UI and you can like  It's base to like - Dodge out of the way and there's a new animation blending. So it feels pretty fluid. Yeah, whereas when I look back at Diablo 2 is really clunky. You know, the way you move. Yeah of like walks to tack really rigid animations. Yeah. Yeah, which I think definitely colors are memory of it. Yeah, and like I don't know I wrote at the time like  I think a lot of people who long for return to that Darkness were growing up in a time when anything Satan adjacent was still sort of still in the broader culture felt a little bit more taboo, you know, and now people are running around with like wicked demons on their tattoos on their arms and t-shirts and you know, it's the fear the Christian fear is no longer like the dominant fear today and for me.  Can in my life like as a teen who like would play it in the back of a Radio Shack in this like dingy internet cafe and like kind of peer over the shoulder of like a cool like a seventeen-year-old, you know and see all the skeletons and like dark scenes that felt way freakier. And so I don't know like I think it's going to be for Diablo 2 like still be a game about Loot and super empowered.  Characters and and to have that like detached sort of distant and safe isometric Viewpoint. It's never going to be like I'm thinking unless it's the art is truly truly truly fucked up and like there are some some significant changes to how it plays. I don't think it's ever going to like recapture that feeling and that's okay. I don't think it's like, okay. Yeah, it's still it needs to be that but I mean like the trailer was great the Cinematic one, you know, but then you get in of course in your  You know popping off, you know, lightning spells and yeah shouldn't Firebolts the things and just killing everything you see and I don't know the demo wasn't too hard there. They told me like, oh well, if you go on the main quest path of the demo, like it won't be as hard. But if you go off to a different place, it'll be harder. And so I did on the second time. I just came out and turn left and ran somewhere else and it was harder than enemies had a higher level than me button.  I don't know. I felt like I was cleaning him up pretty good. I think they're gonna have a hard time.  Striking the right balance for everyone in the Overworld because it is a shared world. So it's not like you're choosing a difficulty option for that portion of the game because they can't have it be yeah, you can have it be harder for me out there than someone standing next to me that would make a lot of sense. They said you can seek out, you know hard areas of the world. But then when you go into a dungeon, I guess that'll be like an instance for you and your Co-op party. If you have people where you can they told me they'll have very  Annular difficulty settings for for dungeons. So see how that shakes out. Yeah. I think that's one thing we should clarify is that and probably the most exciting change for me like Joe and I don't know how you feel about the new look. I'm sure you're into it. Oh, yeah, I have yeah, it's I mean in terms of and I also played the demo to I kind of just assumed that like  Give us all of our abilities up front. So we had an idea of like what it would be like to play each class. So I just kind of assumed like okay, maybe when the game actually comes out like we're not going to start off with like all these other higher-level abilities. And I don't know if that is actually true or not, but I think for me I'm like, okay because I have access to literally every high-level ability that made it easy for me to kill all the enemies and clean up aisle. I mean I  Like that, it felt similar to Diablo 3 in terms of the the gameplay on how about the dialogue was way better though like the writing. Okay. I'm glad yeah you brought that up because like that's something I think that's been lost in the conversation. I want to get to eventually the well, yeah something else but like I hated Diablo 3's like really hokey. Like I don't know it felt like  to like they were trying to be too grandiose with them like high fantasy in this dark world and it just fell work. Yeah and work but you the writings bit more grounded or at least like grim and suited to the setting the quest is very simple like you you find this Lantern in a crypt and you take it to this woman who's bound her son up because he's having visions of this Lantern and and wants to go find it.  He sort of raving about it and you're just helping interpret those visions and then going in his place to what he sees. So it's a very, you know, it is a yeah, it's very dark fantasy story. I guess I guess like doesn't need to be  Free and literature for me. I'd it just needs to be like give me the sense of communicate reinforce the sense of a kind of a Grimmer more fucked up a cult. Yeah World idea. What yeah overall story is going to be obviously that trailer killing demons pretty rare. But this little whatever it was this little Quest was as fine cool. Yeah. Yeah, I meant to get this earlier but to clarify  like the big new change  is the structure the overall structure of the game. This is a shared world as you were saying Tyler but it's a big open world. It's not just a yeah, you know five five zones you have mounts and it's contiguous. So like it's not like you're loading the canoe zones. It's all as far as I know right? It's contiguous. I'm mad at video games for getting me to use the word mounts in place horse neighing of horses. And yeah, and so it is all connected. You can go anywhere from the  they say there is level scaling of enemies so that if I've played, you know, four hours and you want to jump in you're not just going to hmm murdered by a high-level enemies, but uh, they said that just because the level of the enemy scale doesn't mean that getting more powerful gear won't make you more powerful, but I'm like, I'm trying to understand how their yeah, they must have a lot of  It feels like a complicated thing to design like definitely if I'm you know level 8 and we want all the attributes in this area to be level 8 because we're scaling them to me, but I have I don't know. It's super powerful gear that can I don't know. It seems like a lot to balance like putting level scaling in a game like Diablo or okay, but like I said when you go into the dungeons  That's where you'll get what we didn't see this but I guess that's where you'll get to choose how difficult to you want to make it. Right? So like I don't understand it and darling we don't need to get into like super specifics, but apparently like there are certain key drops that will allow you to transform dungeon to and gaming game. Yeah, we're done game always makes me worried. But yeah, I don't know like yeah, that's like the most Insidious part of Diablo for me is the endgame and he's  Games period period but I don't know like I think for me it's the open world is an exciting prospect. It's basically like an MMO. I right like yeah, it's like a high bridge sort of as much as best in. He's an MMO or something, you know? Yeah, it's not like he join a server and there's persistent people who play on that server. It's just like yeah, here's will appear in towns and you could party up with them or walk away and ignore them and they'll be world events.  Like a world boss that a bunch of players in an area could you know, I assume it'll appear on the map and try to attract players at school like that would be exciting for me. So player as a legion when that extension for a while while came out so suppose. Yeah. I just like really I think it's a great opportunity to  to because Diablo Diablo historically at least like two and three from what I remember three, especially the the main draw was just like the the empowerment Loop just getting loot running things over and over and 2 min max your guy and like more efficiently do the same things on higher difficulties over and over and over and there's like a for people who are like math minded and really love that stuff. Excuse me, froggy that can be really fun. But for me, it's just  Like the mood and setting and looking cool and and like the first time through Diablo is always great and I really hope like this over world. It's an opportunity to make it an interesting place to explore. Like I just really hope it's not we have some biomes and some some dungeons to dip into I hope there are really cool. Just I don't know like quest to stumble onto  or like tiny little I guess environmental stories and secrets and one off things. Like I hope it that exploration itself becomes is like valuable as that empowerment cycle is cool world. I don't know I ran into lots of dead bodies skeleton piles. I went into one dungeon where there was like a dying guy who I could like protect from like waves.  Yes, I think he died so know what would have happened if you didn't because I didn't protect him good enough. He feels yeah, well, you know screw that guy a 20 minute demo I have things to do, you know only only so much time you mentioned the the the lantern Quest I you know the kid basically exploded lie just started vomiting black out of his mouth like Exorcist style. I'm  Like yeah, yes more of this, please but I think the story is going to be absolutely Bonkers if we're going to go off the trailers any indication of that. I mean Louis going to play a major part in this story. She's not just going to be like some endgame boss like Diablo 2, like there's and I mean you're basically like fighting all of her demons along the way which Harkens a lot back to her mythology. Hmm as well.  Um, because I mean for like long story short one part that I'm writing about is I'm she is actually believed to be Adam's first wife, but she basically was like, well Adam doesn't see see me as an equal. So I'm just going to go fuck off and do my own thing and then God sends Three Angels to go find her by the Red Sea when they get there. She's created all of these demons and they're basically like Lilith. What do you do when you're not supposed to do this Adam?  I want you back go back and she's like no, I'm not going back, you know, so she strikes a deal with with the angels. They allow her to stay out there, but they're going to kill like a hundred of her demons every single day. So yeah. Yes. I'm like, okay, you know, yeah, you know, it doesn't seem like they're, you know going down that exact path considering like the Lord that they've already established for her on about on Thursday. There's  They've definitely pulled out a lot of things from it. So yeah, either way I mean like  I'm glad we're reflecting on Diablo for right now, but we got in terms of release. We got the it's been a while since I heard this blizzard answer of when it's done or whatever. Like we don't know. I and Tyler you were saying you'd be really really surprised if it doesn't happen next year. Well, not necessarily they've announced it for the current generation of consoles. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.  Those going to be is going to be new consoles at the end of next year, right? So but that doesn't mean that they can't release it on sorry across all the consoles in two years or who knows right? I think after last year when people were disappointed about Diablo Immortals being announced and after the various other controversies blizzard has gone through they knew they needed a big show.  Yeah, so, you know the fact that it was playable tells me like maybe it's a little farther along than they are saying but they kept telling me there's a ton of work to do. So, okay. See I would love to talk about the demons and blood and the black vomit for much longer, but we up some more stuff to get through and OverWatch to is one of those things OverWatch to join it. Like this is not like your headline because thank you blue.  Blizzard coming out came out of the gates saying like we're going to redefine what sequels are and your headline was what exactly it was was it OverWatch to is definitely an expansion rather than a sequel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so break down what this is for us and what you mean by that so I mean playing the demo and talking with the with the developers. This was essentially their chance to delve into  To a lot of the Lord that they've already established through the archives for the the current game. So whatever bits and pieces we know they're expanding on that through heroquest sand or the not cross the the hero modes and story mode for for OverWatch to so this is a chance to go more in depth is to actually what happened to I'm assuming the disbanding of  Watch everything that happened in between why the null sector is like kind of crazy scary this time around which is the whole reason why Wednesday and is trying to bring back the OverWatch crew is because things are getting a little bit out out of hand. So this is that chance in a PVE starting to experience. Yeah more of the lore and  And the what's his name of Michael Michael to I'm the he's the lead story writer for OverWatch was just saying like we've been dying to tell this for a very very long time. So the game is still very far off from coming out and just Kaplan said that but I mean if you played the demo and Tyler, I don't know if you got to play the the demo as well to make it darn it. It felt  You you can feel how far off it is in the demo because they only had a 20-minute like story mode basically everything they talked about with hero modes and everything else like that wasn't there. They basically only have like rough ideas of how they want leveling to work for the hero modes if it's going to be, you know, some type of RPG branching skill tree or if it's going to be  More like a progression system, which is what the story mode is, which is similar to Heroes of the Storm, but they did say that they likened or if they yeah, they like in the heroes the hero mode two more like that. I'm World quest for Wow, or if yeah, I forget what other example they gave but it's in it's in my My article, but they're playing around with a lot of  He is at the moment. And you know, I'm I will put money on they're going to have another demo of OverWatch to at BlizzCon next year, but it's going to be very very different. Yeah, they just there wasn't it felt it played very much like left Left 4 Dead 2 in the sense that you know, you are able to pick between four Heroes and the heroes are designated based on which map your  Playing so you don't get to like hero mode. You don't get to run in there and be like I want to play a Widowmaker will know you know, the map that we played on them Rio. We only had Tracer Reinhardt Lucio and may to choose from and if your other teammates got in there and picked one before you, you know, you're basically stuck with you know, okay. Well, yeah, what one right now. Oh, yeah. Yeah fine to design.  Co-op experience that's like in a story mode like with people picking any character would be it feels like would be impossible, right? Yeah. That's it. Yeah, especially for OverWatch. Yeah. Yeah, and that's exactly what they said. They're like, you know for story mode as much as we'd love to give, you know, everybody the option to play whatever we want. Like we can't effectively like tell the best story that we can unless we limit it their characters are flies. He have people. Yeah flying out.  The map Ernie no, not necessarily that but just like if you're trying to put certain specific challenges in the players way, right? Yeah have a player you can just skip that challenge based on their ability. Yeah that makes total sense to so I'm assuming you know that their thought process is exactly the same with that. But yeah, just basically you run through there and you're fighting a bunch of robots and then you get to the end and you fat the Big Bad Robot and then will the robots as an enemy. I don't like robots.  Enemy No, I mean it's the the null sector so it goes along with with the lore, but I asked them like are we going to fight robots the entire time and they're like, well, you know, we can't really say anything but you're you know, you're definitely you know going to come across like some other characters and they were very very vague about it over time. Yeah, you know, they're still figuring stuff out. So but I don't want to fight robots.  It's the entire time either especially when there's like other characters that are like the antithesis for what OverWatch is. I think that would be very exciting to bring those in there and see what they do with it. The what else the new PVP mode the the APUSH map. Yeah interesting concept don't know unless the teams are evenly matched it. It's just going to be like payload.  Has the robot just pushes along hits certain checkpoints along the way and they can get to the end of the map and the team that I play with. We we completely got smashed alike. They they steamrolled us so so so bad, but then, you know, like payload if the you know how the opposing team like if they are the the team that's defending if they stop the payload after a certain point of time. It starts to slowly roll backwards.  I mean, it's push is just like that except when the other team gets control of the robot it goes, you know back towards the other the other endpoint at the same pace and the maps are symmetrical this this time around they're a bit bigger. There's a lot more places to flank and to like kind of hide in a corner the other team the Bastion already knew where all the good spots were. So that was a huge reason why we just got mowed down and it was like why  It seems like they're still needs some lots lots of work a lot of polishing. So yeah, I definitely didn't excite me as much as double Florida. It will save it. Yeah, at least it's something to I don't know OverWatch when I talk to people and Bo last week rest in peace bow, he's not dead just shouldn't joke about a kind of but he's no longer with PC Gamer the traitor  but yeah, like the impression I get is that OverWatch is in need of some kind of restructuring or kick in the pants something to to give it new life, especially in this era of I don't know it came out right before the big battle royale dealio and right before a lot of  Games went free to play or tried different my like monetization models. Like I know Siege went really really cheap and kind of found a big person audience and OverWatch is getting just big and complicated in terms of multiplayer the multiplayer mode. And so I'm just kind of wondering do you feel like you feel like this is this is gonna be enough or or are we just kind of waiting until next year until we see like how the stuff  Sup, and the long term and I think I think waiting. Yeah, there's not a whole lot to go on right now. I think they have good ideas. And there's a lot of potential but it's just waiting to see like how all those ideas actually take shape and how it comes out in the game in terms of the story and the mechanics and yeah not I mean 20 20 minutes Mo like like Diablo. I mean, it's not a whole lot to go on but the thing with Diablo, I mean that's a mouthful.  It so polished. So yeah, like I don't have a sense of how much of this open world and Diablo for they've built it could be that this is their vertical slice this just this one area is what exists in which case they definitely have a long way to go but they really wouldn't give us an indication but it did feel like a completed game. We were playing it didn't feel right. Yeah or Diablo 2 Sheen. Yeah.  One of the cutscenes was a little bit. Yeah, like I don't know. Don't worry. She's like kind of crawling through the tunnel was it wasn't yeah, most slick they have to do a lot of cutscenes in engine now because there's going to be character creation. Yeah. Oh, yeah, so I think most if not, all the cutscenes will be in engine. So that'll be different. I think gotcha like that. But yeah, it felt very close.  Stu  To being sort of the final product, but just a sample of it though. I have no idea how they're gonna build out the rest. Yeah. Well either way I guess will be that one. Jeff Kaplan also said we have no idea when it will be done and it's a long way off overall from the sound of it probably longer than I believed him. Like, I mean, we'll have something again to play with it over what or not OverWatch at BlizzCon next year, but it felt very much like they're still trying out stuff.  And they wanted to have something for everybody to try out just to see like hey, here's what we're thinking of. Let's like unofficially get everybody's feedback. Like that's what it kind of felt like it was it's still very OverWatch e gotcha. So let me cool. Well, I don't want to keep you guys too long. So why don't we just move on to the final topic of the day? Oops? It shows Red Dead Redemption to came out of PC Tuesday.  I've been playing a bunch of it. I've already played through the story on Loop. Hello cat on the PlayStation 4 when it first came out so I kind of know what to expect there. I played a couple hours of it. Anyway. Otherwise, I've been playing the multiplayer mode because I think that's sort of what we'll have the longest tail if the GTA 5, excuse me GTA online is anything to go by a big role playing seen huge player population and I  Read that too could could could tap into that. I mean it's rock star so they'll support it for a long long long time. But yeah kind of summed up my early thoughts on the website after one day and the big takeaway is that I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played or at least like in terms of how it captures America sort of at the Tipping.  And between still being a early early colonization and the following wave of like industrialization and law that kind of wiped out the old west and that's where the story goes. That's what the story is All About. It's about Arthur Morgan and his band of Outlaws is chosen family sort of contending with the these new  Imperial forces and how that changes their relationships with one another and their relationships to strangers and and and nature itself. It's like a really really well done character story and it kind of hard to articulate because it is essentially it's so fucking long something like I played like 50 60 hours.  Is that it's kind of hard to boil down until like good or bad. I think it's good overall, but it's basically like saying every season of you know, if you're going to look at the Game of Thrones TV series or something and say well that was a good show. But even if like half of it was shit, there's a there's some Peaks and valleys in this narrative as well. But overall, I think Arthur Morgan's story is it's rockstars best story yet and  As personal inhumane it's not bogged down by silly satire. That doesn't always work. It's just a yeah nice human human take on the era more Deadwood than any spaghetti western kind of style though. So I like it. I like that. Yeah, you are you caught my attention at like role playing on the multiplayer servers and like because I've always been like I never I'm pretty much like 99  .9% Like game on PC solely just don't like controllers. Um, so, you know watching some gameplay of red dead in the past. I'm like, okay, this looks interesting. You know, it looks like I could get into this but like it's such a huge time sink, but I like the idea of role-playing so, I mean that that that would be a reason why I would pick this up on PC. Did they did they have that when it released  year ago on the I don't think the online mode came and became a became a week later in beta and and it didn't have  you know, I just didn't touch it because the idea of playing I don't like the shooting controls on the console. It's really sluggish and imprecise and you know, like I just didn't bother I know it was just it was pretty thin and Bare Bones compared to what it is now and I will say like on PC and I'll get to the technical stuff in a minute because it's a big question mark But on PC like it put this is the way to play the game. Mouse control amazing you can read  Figure the keyboard controls you can make it like suit your style. There are a ton of toggles for like different kinds of like camera nuances and you know UI all that stuff. It's like fully featured in terms of PC controls and and the first person mode which was awful on Playstation because it was really like and I remember this in GTA5 to I don't know if they ever changed it for PC or what but  they it was basically like controlling a they're kind of like weighty third person character. But in third person this time mouselook is instant. There's no delay. There's some you know, like you're not forced to inhabit the sluggish body of this character you can it kind of it speeds up the default like you're not walking by default your kind of like jogging by default. So it makes it  I feel like more of a first person shooter. You kind of fault over small obstacles automatically. It feels really really good in first person. You can blow out the fov. It's really easy to switch between like first and third if you prefer horseback stuff on in third person and such so like the way to play definitely what a play problem is. It's one hell of a resource hog, like and I'm like not surprised Like the quote I think.  The first day besides the bugs and such people were running it to like I think the the instant response and this is a habit that even I admit to having is like anytime. I got a new PR game. I'm like, all right juice everything to ultra. This is the PC. I'm gonna play it at its at its best as prettiest and if it doesn't work, I kind of get disappointed or sometimes frustrated and especially if you are a little bit, you know forward-looking with those settings.  Yes, almost no one can run it at Ultra at really so and that's yeah, I think some of the backlash around this was like well, this was on a console game on PlayStation 4 like why can't I fucking kill it on all the high settings? It's because they're sort of it's a little bit of both right? It's like it's not I was talking to Jared our Hardware guy and he's doing  big Benchmark on this game right now analysis, and he says a little bit about this a lot of people there A lot of extra settings and gravel of graphical effects. That most cards will not be able to really play with and contend with and just juicing everything to ultra is not is not indicative of like how well it runs necessarily on your PC. It's all you might have to keep it on high or medium thing is the still gonna look amazing and way better than the console version. There are a lot of bells and whistles.  You can disable to get good frame jumps and such like I had but even then like I'm running it 2560 by 1440. I have a GTX 2080 and and I 999 hundred K processor 32 gigabytes of RAM do you for so I've like the ideal up-to-date modern PC barring? Like I don't know if the ti or whatever like I should theoretically be able to like juice this game and get good performance and I can I can  juice it mostly to ultra I disable like MSA a volumetric lighting effects, like kind of push down a bit because that those are big resource Hogs and I can maintain about  Between 60 to 80 frames a second. And if you see like the amount of texture detail and like draw distance and everything going on in this game. It's like that to me. I'm satisfied with that.  You know, I always want to be better. So I think like  The problem is it requires. They're like the presets and all these things and there's so many switches and levers and if you're not you haven't been tinkering with graphic settings for a while. This is going to require that you're going to have to require its get you're going to have to play around to find what what works for you. I guess the other issue is and I've experienced less of this is that some people are and I don't know like the breath of the problems, you know, when a game comes out. It's like hard to quantify like  The people mad on Reddit do they represent? You know the majority of the player base or what like are these problems widespread or are they just like kind of popping up because subreddits are are really good places to amplify outrage for better or worse. So I try not to like look at that stuff is indicative of like the whole a couple days of past though. Sorry Tyler we can save them. No, I mean this does seem to be more widespread as far as yeah. Can't run it.  At all, that's the thing something that's like yeah people trying to write about it for, you know competing websites of our earliest have had problems with it as well. And it does seem to be quite a few people again it mean I don't know how many people bought the game on PC. So if it's like, you know, 50,000 people having trouble out of  You know a million people who bought it that's different. But I kind of doubt it sold that well on PC on them. Yeah and and like as the days of gone on like it's become clear to me because like first day I had no problems. I was like, okay everyone I talk to you internally and like other folks like we're having problems. I was like, okay who you know like so I just like didn't I didn't like by in to buy into I just didn't like want to in my day one Impressions to be like it's bad or it's you know, it's good in that regard because I just didn't know.  Um, but now like last night it crashed three times on me this morning crashed again all during the online mode performance is totally fine. Otherwise, we're still seeing some folks who can't launch it at all either because like an anti-virus program like blocking it. It's the launcher itself is kind of bugging weird and pretty new. Yeah. You're playing it through the rock star lunch, right? Yeah. Yeah.  Also on Epic yeah. Yeah. I think the big test of it almost feel like they're beta testing it on us. That's the big picture the steam launch next month. Yeah, you know, I think that's where a lot of their sales are going to come from right? So definitely team. Yeah. Sorry John I go on I was just going to say think they also released a new patch the other day. I remember Jared saying something about it always makes him nervous when they release  Game update any still in the middle of testing. So I mean it's not unheard of for developers to really Pat to release patches for their games and and then it breaks stuff more than six benchmarking guy. He's like, yeah, I can invalidate half this shit, but it's like  I would not recommend right now. Anyone buy this I would wait I would that's like where I'm at right now, even though it's like it's painful because when the multiplayer works and or when all that stuff works when I'm playing it is it's an astounding like world. It's much slower Pace than ever, you know, your typical GTA.  but it's like a beautifully crafted world so much detail and so much potential especially in the multiplayer for role playing and and getting it to strange Shenanigans Andy Kelly who played a lot of the multiplayer on Console compared it to read online to the early days of Daisy when you just don't know what any interaction with any given person is going to be like, yeah, so I'm just bummed because I want to get in there and I want to  it to see the potential and like play around with what's going on in you know, like I have all these dreams for role-playing and I spent a couple hours as a graveyard keeper just like there are people getting into shootouts in this town and I would just like carry the dead bodies to the church graveyard and some like people would start falling like eventually people started following me and he's like tiny processions and like would they would mourn their fallen?  Read who would also attend their own funerals they would respond but at the end they would say things over the mic and it was just funny, you know, there's a lot of room for playfulness. You can you can kind of get out of it. Whatever.  Everyone's willing to bring to it and that's really exciting to me. It's just it's just it's just I don't think it was a hundred percent ready for prime time. Yeah rock star like I would expect better quality assurance of a big release like this again game development is difficult and sometimes you can't predict these issues. So I don't yeah. Where does The Fault lie, we can't point a finger very easily and we just happened. See ya.  on a month when it's on Steam those of us who are being the guinea pigs of the initial launch will hopefully  hopefully help them by reporting these issues and iron them stuff out. Yeah, so I'll probably play it next month. I'll be good good. No, they break game. Yeah, there's I want to roleplay. Can I can I be an old lady? You gotta make an old lady. Yeah, like the only issue I have with the online mode. Is that like  Clothes are really expensive and locked by level sometimes so I don't know like I'm still figuring out like how it all works kind of like hard to parse just like GTA V. It's just a shit. They throw in try not to worry about it the other day. I went to the H&M and they were like sorry sir. You can't buy this shirt. This is a level 6. It is literally like that like the time let me buy it, but I guess they are markers of  progression like oh, yeah. Why can't there be I mean, I guess I mean, okay, like there's certain like specialized armor. You can get in WoW, which is indicative of like I did this dungeon or whatever, you know, so I guess that but when it's something like  Red Dead Redemption, it seems I mean in terms of Storytelling it seems a I would make a lot more sense to tie it into like you need money to buy this rather than oh, you need to be a level. Well that's thinking money. Yeah and a level which is just frustrates like yeah anyway, but you know, maybe there's I just haven't figured out like the economy of that game and like or no. I just don't want to think about leveling up. I just want to be in that world and you know the same way but GTA online has  Martyrdom sure, someone is already looking at how to create, you know, role-playing servers and things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be unlock all that progression stuff for you, but I really hope so the last time I play GTA online may be the only time like someone was hacking and literally raining down cash on top of me no matter where I went and then spawning tanks behind me. Oh my God, so that's another thing we'll have to yeah Oscar has a  Like like make their games, but also make them worse because because people hack in multiplayer so they walk this line being between trying to lock down the multiplayer as much as possible and knowing that like one of the things that made GTA online such a hit were those role-playing servers. Yeah, so no. Yeah. I look forward to people just reining horses on my head.  Horse rain today. Anyway, you know, I have to just get in there and play bunch more and hopefully some stability patch or something comes out because I just I can't play for more than like 20 minutes without hitting a crash or something snag of some kind at least last night, but will overview as soon as I can see what is there which which depends on a lot right now, but next week is the goal. Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, we'll be talking about this game plenty more in the future. I'm sure or least I hope so hope the PC Community takes it and runs with it. Once it stabilizes. Anyway, that's gonna do it for us today. Thanks for hanging out you to on our first kind of run back on the on Twitch and our new time slot ish. We have you know, maybe we push it to 9:30 or something and so we can all get situated but it looks you figure it out.  We will figure it out. But as always you can catch the show a PC gamer.com tag / podcast for the Spotify feed. The iTunes feed the RSS feed anchor dot. F m-- v wherever like to listen to podcasts you can find these should the VOD the video on demand at youtube.com / PC Gamer after the fact and you can catch us here in the morning ish 9 o'clock ish Pacific time.

They're hybrid Punk 2077 next year next year. Yeah, I guess we'll be getting into some Game of the Year stuff and reflection time and then going to break. But yeah, so that's gonna do for us this week until next week. Don't forget to  Game on so much enthusiasm. I love it.

He reached out expecting to put his arms around his wife instead. He discovered. She was already gone. He found a note from her informing him. She had gone to shore for dinner with her friend fellow actor Christopher Walken Robert was agitated. He thought they had put their  Their issues behind them now. He felt abandoned on the yacht with only Captain Davern for company Robert took a deep breath and composed himself. He would join them for dinner on Shore and everything would be all right, Robert dressed and headed to the restaurant where he found Christopher and Natalie eating and laughing together. He sat with them and the three began drinking together.  they drank heavily and it didn't take long for them to grow Rowdy after a couple of hours Doug bombard the owner of the restaurant and a friend of Natalie and Robert helped us Court them back to the Splendor along with Christopher as they drunkenly stumbled aboard the yacht it was clear emotions were running High between Natalie and her husband for her part Natalie spent most of her time talking to Christopher which  Inflamed Roberts.

He waited for around 15 minutes before going to check on Robert and Natalie.  He found Robert on the deck red-faced and disheveled. Natalie was nowhere to be seen.  Robert told Davern that Natalie had gone missing Dennis couldn't understand how that was possible. It was a large. Yacht but there weren't many places to hide. He asked his boss if they should call the Coast Guard worried Natalie might have fallen overboard everyone knew she couldn't swim. So he was especially worried. Something bad might have happened to her Robert told him to wait and that he expected Natalie back.  At any moment since Robert was Natalie's husband and Dennis's boss the captain trusted him and waited an hour for Natalie to return when she didn't Robert called some friends he knew on Catalina Island and ask them to go searching for Natalie.  Robert and Dennis, sat down and drank some more while they waited to hear word from Roberts friends a full two hours later at 3:30 a.m. On November 29th. The Harbormaster finally convinced Robert to call the Coast Guard, but by then it was too late.  Coming up the police discover. Natalie's body now back to the story.

Natalie had gone missing hours earlier aboard a yacht named the Splendor the captain of the yacht heard her arguing with her husband actor.  Wagner until around midnight according to Witnesses when he was told his wife's body had been found Robert only looked down at the ground hardly reacting at all. But to the public news of Natalie's death was a bombshell the film industry and the nation at large mourned her tragic passing four months afterward. Meanwhile police began an investigation into the circumstances.  circumstances that led to Natalie's death the three men who were aboard the Splendor that night Captain Dennis Davern Robert Wagner and Natalie's friend actor Christopher Walken all maintained that her death was an accident some evidence cast doubt on their claims for one Natalie's body had bruises on her arms and torso in addition to Witnesses on a  Other nearby boat heard a woman crying out for help at some point during the night despite this police found little else which hinted at Foul Play.

Job at the studio where he was filming the TV show Heart to Heart according to Dennis while he was working at the studio. He lived in Roberts house. He described himself as essentially Roberts prisoner.  Dennis said a driver took him directly to and from his job at the studio every day when he closed the door to his room in Roberts house at night a magnetic lock automatically engaged according to Dennis. He couldn't leave his own room after a certain hour at the time. He assumed Robert was very security-conscious and that all the rooms had similar locks looking back. He wondered if Robert was  Being a close eye on him following Natalie's death despite his ever-growing suspicions. Dennis remained silent about Natalie's drowning for decades. Then in 2011. He publicly changed his story. He stated that he lied to the police immediately following Natalie's death. He now claims Robert prevented him from turning on the Searchlight or calling the cops.  Coast Guard after Natalie went missing in 1981. He even went as far as to allege that Robert was directly responsible for Natalie's drowning his statements caused police to reopen the case and amend Natalie's death certificate. They changed the official cause of her death from drowning to drowning and other undetermined factors into  2013 the coroner's office added to Natalie's original autopsy report the addendum stated it was possible. Natalie's bruises had been incurred prior to her death though. There was no way to know for sure. Both Robert Wagner and Christopher Walken have disputed Dennis's claims that Robert had anything to do with Natalie's death walk-in has never been considered a suspect but police  Police named Robert a person of interest in the case in 2018 as of 2019.

Today is Sunday, February 2nd 2020 on this day in 2011. 18 year old Israel Nieves shot and killed 19 year old Jason Rodriguez in what he later claimed was a drug-induced blackout.  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're covering the murder of Valencia College student Jason Rodriguez by his jealous rival 18 year old Israel Nieves. Let's go back to the night of February 2nd 2011 to a quiet neighborhood in Orlando.  Florida  it was 10:15 p.m. Israel Nieves waited on a dark deserted Street. His blurred gaze was fixed on a house nearby. He was drunk and high on wet marijuana laced with PCP through the haze. He managed to stay focused on his plan for the past eight months. Israel had been obsessed with a 20 year old woman to protect her privacy will refer to her.  Is Sarah Israel and Sarah started dating in May of 2010 had fallen for each other quickly and run into conflict just as fast their arguments turned violent once when Sarah said she was going to leave him Israel smashed his fist into a wall another time. He held a knife to her throat and forced her to have sex with him even in the face of this abuse Sarah.  They always let Israel back into her life. But then in November of 2010 something changed Sarah told Israel. Once again that she was done. Once again, he threatened her warning that if she left him he'd hurt her family this time instead of going back to him. Sarah went to the police.  On November 22nd 2010 Sarah filed an injunction against Israel in an Orange County court in a hearing two weeks later. The judge issued a restraining order telling Israel to stay away from Sarah or face possible jail time, but Israel couldn't let Sarah go. He wanted her to be his and his alone Israel decided to do whatever it took to get Sarah back, but right.  After the hearing she began dating 19 year old body builder Jason Rodriguez to Israel. Jason was nothing more than a Playboy if he could convince Sarah that Jason was cheating on her, perhaps he could lure her back to him.  Around the end of December Israel came up with a plan using a burner phone and a fake email address. He created a Facebook profile for a fictional young woman named Ty Ann. He used photos of one of his female friends to make the profile seem authentic in mid January of 2011 Israel. Began messaging Jason pretending to be Ty Ann. He flirted with the bodybuilder and an effort to prove that.  Jason was a cheater Jason immediately took the bait. He responded to Ty Ann's messages and eventually started texting her on the burner number after a week or two. He asked Ty Ann to video chat. This could have blown the entire plan. But Israel handled it like a pro. He contacted the friend whose pictures he had used to create tions profile. He told her he was playing a practical joke on.  On someone and asked her to join in the young woman agreed never realizing what Israel had in mind. She spoke to Jason on a video call pretending to be the flirty Ty Ann a few days later on February 2nd 2011 Israel followed up with an invitation for Jason to come to Ty Ann's House despite the fact that he was still dating Sarah Jason agreed.  It confirmed everything that Israel suspected about Sarah's new boyfriend. He didn't deserve her.  This sent Israel on a Binger after giving Jason and address. He spent several hours drinking and smoking wet then long after dark. He got in his car and drove to the quiet neighborhood near Valencia College by now. His vision was blurred. He could barely see the house across the street yet. When a green Honda Accord pulled up to the curb around 10:15 p.m. He knew exactly  Who was at the wheel Israel tied a black bandana around his face like a mask. He Strode across the street and approached the window of the parked car as Jason looked up from the driver's seat. Israel pulled out a 32 caliber pistol and shot him in the face. Israel's rival slumped over in his seat apparently dead, but Israel didn't have time to savor the moment for the  First time he noticed there was another car up the street with someone in the driver's seat a witness.  Coming up. We'll learn how Israel was caught in his own snare podcast listeners.

Now back to the story on February 2nd, 2011 18 year old Israel Nieves shot his romantic rival Jason Rodriguez in a drug-induced Haze, but a witness saw the attack from a nearby vehicle afraid. They might be able to identify him Israel charged the other car firing wildly the driver pulled away and sped off into the night.  Bye now lights were coming on in houses all along the street even in his altered state Israel knew the cops were on their way. He rushed back to his own vehicle and drove off sirens in the distance moments after he fled First Responders arrived at the scene. They found 19 year old Jason Rodriguez lying in his Honda with gunshot wounds in the face and neck.  He was unconscious and in critical condition, but he was still breathing paramedics rushed him to the hospital family members spent the next several days praying at his bedside despite their fervent efforts. However, Jason tragically passed away a week later.  Luckily detectives were already on the trail of his killer. Thanks to a tip from the witness. They knew the shooter had worn a black. Bandana. They'd also talked to Jason's friends and learned about his online affair with the so-called Ty Ann but they couldn't figure out who Ty Ann was detectives checked out the phone number and email associated with the account and found that both were dead ends thus far.  Israel's efforts to cover his tracks were successful detectives called in the big guns computer forensic Specialists managed to trace the origin of Ty Ann's messages back to Israel cell phone and iPad from there detective secured a search warrant in April of 2011 two months after the shooting investigators entered Israel's family home. They searched his bed.  Bedroom where they found a 32 caliber pistol and a black bandana. They arrested Israel on suspicion of murder at first Israel swore. He knew nothing about the crime but under interrogation. He eventually broke down. He told detectives he drunk and smoked so much that night that he had blacked out. He didn't remember pulling a trigger and he was sure he'd never  Wanted Jason Rodriguez dead. This argument might have been more convincing if it weren't for Israel's History of Violence when Sarah had filed for a restraining order back in November. She'd established legal evidence of his aggressive tendencies. Furthermore Ty Ann's Facebook profile along with the fake email and burner phone suggested that Israel's crime was thoroughly premeditated as a result. He  I failed to convince a jury to blame the killing on the drugs and alcohol on September 13, 2013. Israel was found guilty of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison and is currently housed at Florida's Taylor Correctional Institution.  Thanks for listening to today and True Crime.

We've been a series of called words is a word say we're all right. So this morning we're going to have to listen fast because I felt impressed that you be connected with what we're doing around the nation's this morning. How many think that's good to know what we're doing to know where your sewing is going. So we know where our sewing is going. Yeah, it's blessing people around the world. So I want to go to Psalms 119. We're going to read down through this real quick.  Look, this is our text blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord blessed are those who keep his testimonies who seek him with the with what with the whole heart verse 3 they also do no iniquity. They walk in his ways now watch this when you keep it with your whole heart. There's a breakthrough you don't you don't continue in iniquity verse 4  You have commanded us to keep your precepts diligently.  All that my ways were directed to keep your statutes. We'll talk about this a little bit later, but statutes are written words statutes are the written law verse 6, then I would not be ashamed when I look into all your what Commandments were seven.  I will praise you cos I will praise you so I'll give you a high praises.  That's what we've been doing this morning.  That will praise you with uprightness of what okay, so we are going to pursue him or seek him with our whole heart and I will praise you with uprightness of heart when I learn your righteous what judgments so we're going to take a look at this this morning and kind of break this down over the next few minutes here. We've been talking about the number of different words throughout the David understood the law of God, so they understood law judgment.  Precepts statutes all of these words were very important words to him. We also need to understand that all of these things that David understood were in the old Covenant the how many know we're living in the New Covenant. So he was in the Old Testament, but we're in the New Testament. We learned this last week that the New Testament in the Old Testament is contained the Old Testament in the New Testament is what explained okay, so it is explained in the New Testament in the New Testament.  Meet God gives us a better so we have a better covenant. Thank God. We have a better Covenant. We've got a covenant that is based on Grace. Somebody say it's based on Grace. Yeah. So in the old in the old Covenant man, they they couldn't go into the holy of holies. Only the high priest could go to the holy of holies. There was a type and Shadow where they were they sacrificed bulls and and lambs and they and they would do this once a year, you know at times when they were  Go in the holy of holies and and they would come before the Lord but it was a type and Shadow of what would come because what actually came was the new and better Covenant and that is the Covenant that Jesus brought to us when he went to the cross and then so his blood was better than lambs and and Bulls his his blood was a perfect spotless lamb blood. Okay, and he cleansed us once and for all say once and for all yeah, so we don't have to every year bring a lamb and  and do a sacrifice before the Lord that was a that was a type of what was coming. So we understand that today, but I want you to catch this because let's go back to Psalms 119 one more time. And let's look at verse 3 real quick one more time Psalms 119 verse 3. They also do no iniquity. They walk in his ways back up to verse 2 in verse 2. He says blessed. Are those who keep his what and who seek him with a whole heart now. I want you to catch this because David understood the courtroom.  He understood it. He understood differently than we understand it because he was a king. They were in a kingdom and not just in a democratic situation like we are today they understood he understood that when he spoke as a king his word became law when he spoke his word became laws. So he understood that the law was important. He understood that if they King accidentally said something it became law. Anyway, if he out of anger said  It became law because he spoke it and I can prove it to you back in the medes and Persians back in that day. You know when they found out that Daniel was Bowing in the king realized. Oh my goodness. I made a I made a law I still get I spoke it and I can't counteract it. And so Daniel had to go into the lions den, but he came out how many know that God shut the mouths of the Lions. And so so the king recognized that there was a king that was over every other king.  And so his word was law and so in the Old Testament, he understood this now, that's a picture. So there's this Law And Then There are testimonies testimonies have to do with so if you don't you think about this as we're studying this like a courtroom, so the law is it is the law of God. The testimonies are like the evidence. It's like the facts or the witnesses. So we have all of these things going on then then as we move along we look at some other statutes will see the word statue.  Our statute is a written law. Now in the garden. God said to Adam don't eat of that tree. How many know when God King of Kings when God said Ancient of Days said don't eat of that tree. How many know that became law it was it written anywhere. He just spoke it but a statute a statute is a is what a law has actually been written when it's been written down. So we're going to kind of take this  And kind of look at this this morning because it's important that we understand what happened in the Old Testaments. Go to Jeremiah. Let's go to Jeremiah 31 and verse 33. I believe it is but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of I feel like running right now. You're not getting this yet. But you're going to get it which will say I'm gonna get it say if I get it I'm gonna get it. Yeah, so if you get it you get to have it. So that's how important it is. But this shall be the Covenant that  I will make with the house of Israel after those days. Saith the Lord. I will put my law in their inward parts and I will write it.  We're so we found out we when we seek him with an with our whole heart that his testimonies become powerful in our lives. We're finding out. Well. Keep we'll keep going to after those days. Saith the Lord. I will put their law in my head and their inward parts and I will write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people now. Listen. This isn't a god who's way up there somewhere our brother told us about three billion go.  Odds in India. I mean they went into a by a temple there. We were in India and I remember they rang a bell and they clapped their hands and I said, what are they doing? They said well, they're waking up their God, you know, I'm not making fun of them but I am saying this I thank God that my God never sleeps nor Slumbers. I don't have to wake him up.  In fact, the Bible says in him is neither shadow of turning. It's a direct correlation to the to the Sundial. The only time there's no shadow of turning on the Sundial is when the sun is at Peak Performance understand this just like when LeBron James has a Peak Performance game. He's an always have a Peak Performance gain, but when he does when he scores 50 points in a game, I mean, it's incredible. Well, that's how our God is our God is always at his Peak  Formats, he is always at High Noon. There is no moment where the enemy catches him off guard. Not one time. Did you have a diagnosis from the doctor that he was worried about it? He already sent his son to make a way for you to be healed. Not one time when you got a bill in the mail that you didn't know how to pay was God worried about it thinking where we going to get it the Bible says, he owns all the gold and all the silver belong to him. Not one moment. Did he have a worry because when he  Ekes out of his mouth the whole earth the whole universe goes into action to make it happen. In fact, the Bible said by faith the worlds were framed in other words, the Aeons the times that the land everything began to unfold sequentially when God speaks. In fact, the word framed literally means that it unfolded in time. So when God spoke at the  Beginning he was thinking not only about Adam in the garden, but he was thinking about you in Trinity gospel this morning and and in his heart and in his mind everything you would ever need would begin to come towards you as you begin to receive what he was speaking. So whatever you need to accomplish your assignment. I'm not talking to you you may not need a poor. She may want it but you may not need it. But whatever you need to accomplish your assignment in God starts.  Coming towards you when you decree it. I will put my law in their inward parts and I will write it in their hearts. Why is this important? Because it becomes a statute when it is written you understand on Pentecost up on the mountain when the Flint when God came down and and God and God wrote God wrote in the stone. He was making his word a statute and in the New Testament in the better Covenant, this is  So powerful in the better Covenant in the law of God you and I we have the word of God and it's how we live our life, but we need to understand some let's let's go on to the next passage the next scripture if you would I think it's whatever I gave you if you've got it bring it up. I think it's a room is it ruins to or Hebrews 10 Romans to 14 when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having  I'm not the law are a law unto themselves first 15 which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another woo. Wow. Go back to verse 14. You didn't get it.  When the Gentile say that is US, yeah, which have not the law in other words, you know a good good Hebrew boy would have would have memorized the Torah by the time he got his bar mitzvah. He would have memorized all of the five books of the law basis which not we don't have the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves and go on which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience.  Even an unbeliever. Can you get this picture God is writing in the hearts of even unbelievers Thou shalt not murder. Don't write don't don't cheat. Don't steal. Don't lie. That's why even the smallest child when when they do these things have the shame that comes a sense of guilt because they know it is written in our hearts. Even in the New Covenant. Let's go to let's go to  Is chapter 10?  Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. In other words. Like I said earlier the law required a sacrifice every year.  And he said but but those sacrifices couldn't make us perfect verse 2 for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers want Spurs should have had no more conscience of sin. So how many understand the people who are bringing their sacrifice for actually coming to worship.  First three but in the sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year in the Old Testament.  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Go to verse. I think it's 16. Yeah, this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days. Saith the Lord after what days the days where they did sacrifices every year once a year to try to give you. Imagine only once a year getting to come to the altar.  Only once a year hoping that you made it through the year and that you listen now we come to Jesus. We ask him to forgive us our of our sins. How many know that he's done it now. I'm not saying that you can't go back out and send once you've been saved many people do but the point is his grace is sufficient. Say his grace is sufficient. This is the Covenant. I will make with them after those days. Saith the Lord. I will put my laws in their heart and in their minds I will write them. Wow.  And their sins and iniquities what?  Whew, he says I'm not going to remember many more. The problem with most Believers is a keep coming back to God with old stuff.  And God keeps looking at him like what are you talking about?  We keep the Devil beats up he beats up on you and you think well, you know, this is happening because I made so many mistakes. Let me tell you something Jesus already paid the price at the cross. He paid the price now, let's go back to Psalms 119 and verse two sons a hundred 19 and verse 2. Let's look at this again.  Blessed are those who do what?  And who do what?  Seek him with the whole heart.  Even as Believers, he's calling us to seek him and to seek his word with our whole heart. Unfortunately, what we do is we just read his word enough to get by we just maintain our cars just enough so that we could keep driving them. The tires are out of alignment. Some of us have one tire out of alignment some have to some have three once you get to for you're driving down the road like yes wonder what's wrong with my car.  You bought it brand new?  But now the car is out of alignment many of us are out of alignment.  With the word of God we're Believers were going to heaven but were living like we're not going there. We're going to heaven but we're living like the ride is really rough. And how many know when you come into alignment with his word. You keep his testimonies with your whole heart go to verse 7 go to verse 7, I will praise you with uprightness of heart win.  Wow.  I thought we praise him on Sunday morning when they start the music.  and by the way, if they do a good job, I will enter in  if they really really really sing a song that I like and I'll praise him.  But if it's not my style.  I may just sit through it like this.  Oh my God, I can't even imagine God enjoying that guitar.  Hunter you need to get right thank God. We have Pastor Michael Kelly because he can play the play the keyboard like David so we have that.  So what is this whole concept of I will praise you with an upright heart when I learn your righteous judgments. Go to Psalms $149 $149 verse 1 Psalm 149 verse 1.  Praise ye the Lord sing to the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of st. So we did that this morning. Let's go on.  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King in the funny. He has to say let all these words. Let let the people praise him. Let them be happy in their King let them Rejoice because everything's trying to steal your joy. The news is trying to steal your joy.  The community there's so many things going on. It is all trying to steal your job. But let them be joyful. And this is let them praise His name in the eye. When we first started having danced in church Jesus help us. I came home from or Roberts University a long time ago.  And and one of the ladies from the church they were they were doing dance down in the front and this lady caught me she was in the back and she said she said Dana I want to see you I said, okay, and and so she said she said, you know I used to dance when I was in the world I said, well I never was really in the world in that way. I didn't go out clubbing, but I can tell you this when I got saved and changed everything. I was two years old. I kicked the ball.  The milk bottle but I kicked it but I'm going to tell you right now I said I said, you know when we get saved We Don't Stop Dancing. We just change Partners let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp keep going for the Lord takes pleasure in his people. He will beautify the meek with what verse 5 let the Saints be. Joyful in glory. Let them sing upon their beds. Look look even when you're at home you can rejoice  Joyce even when you don't feel good and you're laying down in your bed, you can praise in my room one time. I was in Mexico. I had Montezuma's Revenge if anybody doesn't know what that is. That's what you can get when you're in Israel to if you drink the water will make you run into places. Jesus walked 149, six, let the high praises somebody say high praises of God do what and a two  Alleged sword in their hand. I want you to catch this but Praises in your mouth and the word in your hand. The word of God is like a sword you have the authority now old testament old testament is flesh and blood New Testament is spiritual principles. Our fight is not against flesh and blood but against principalities Powers rulers of Darkness Wicked spiritual. How do I give a High Praise with my whole heart for the testimonies of God for the judgments of God? How do I do?  Do that. Well High Praise is more than just singing on Sunday. High Praise is an act of sacrifice. One of the highest Praises you can ever give is an act of worship. An act of worship. The highest form of worship is repentance the moment you agree with God and you say what I'm doing is not right. What you're doing is Right Lord that moment we have entered into an act of High Praise the moment that we forgive somebody that doesn't deserve it now watch this.  Is anybody you forgive didn't deserve it.  You didn't deserve it when God forgave you but forgiveness is an act of high worship. It's not just kind of kind of going around through the motions forgiveness as an act of High Praise when you sew and you have the the woman with the Widow the Widow was with how we say Widow the Widow Widow.  The little Widow the widow woman. She had she had two mites always makes me kind of like like Worcester. I feel like I'm not talking playing when I say Worcester, but the Widow Widow she had she had two mites and those two mites were less than two pennies. But Jesus said behold, she has given more than all of Israel when you make a sacrificial gift. It is a high price and I said, it's a High Praise. All right. So let me tell you what a high praises. I just got a couple minutes here. Hi.  phrases of Praise that is released before the answer arrives  See, I've got the word from the Lord. I've got his testimony, but I haven't seen the manifestation of it yet. High Praise is a praise. I release before the answer arrives. So this is now High Praise is a phrase. I release in spite of my circumstances. Yes. So the word of God I give in spite of my circumstances. Somebody's about to give a High Praise in the in the room some  Lisa preys and because you already healed somebody needs to phrasing because your dad's already cancelled somebody need to praise him because your marriage is already being mended by the spirit of God. Somebody needs to praise him because your child is coming home. Your child is coming home. Somebody needs to praise him because your son or your daughter that's out in the military on the other side of the world. Your grandchild is being protected by the power of God. Somebody needs to lift up our High Praise In Spite of your circumstance a High Praise Is appraised  That silence is the enemy.  Dylan he's just talking in your ear. You're not gonna get through this. You're not gonna make it everybody in your family dies by the age of 45 the enemies just talking I praise him. Anyway, I'll lift him up. He's not here. He's a redeemer. He's a restored. He's one who takes me, it's me up to start talking like that. The devil has to shut his mouth you want to who was it that said the other day. Somebody said said to why it's pastor Pastor Michael last Sunday night Houston, Michael.  Kelly he said he said something like this. I may not get it exactly right. He said why is the devil up by your ear when he supposed to be under your feet man? Was that a great word a high praise is a praise. That is a catalyst the changes absolute atmospheric pressure. It changes the atmosphere. You don't like what's happening in your home get in there and start lifting a High Praise You  There's there's there's conflict. Come on just lift up your head the all the old Saints they used to just say the devil is a liar and then begin to say glory to God. I thank you. This house is covered by the blood of Jesus. This house is filled with God. This house is about to shift atmospheres are about to change pieces of after he released a high praise is a praise that requires a sacrifice. If you don't connect the sacrifice with it, it's just lip service.  You mean give an offering in church? No, I mean lay down your life Wow behind praise is a praise that connects people to the heart of God the moment. You start praising like a what will watch this. Watch this watch this watch. This Jesus on the cross said forgive them and Stephen who was being martyred. They were stoning him and he said lay not this sin.  To their charge give me that shit.  Steven Steven is being stoned and while he's being stoned all of the sudden, they're killing him a High Praise Rises up out of his Spirit a stone hits him in the head. He's hemorrhaging and bleeding from his brow. He feels like he's about to die. But in that moment, he starts to act like Jesus. He doesn't say it the same way. Jesus said if Jesus said forgive him  Not what they do, but but but but Stephen says for what's that? What Jesus said what he said what he said lay not this sin to their charge. Jesus was on the throne. The Bible said in a vision sees a stood up. I want you to get this the moment. He started acting like Jesus Jackie just see Jesus. I can't sit for this the boy Daddy see what he just did what he just did.  Whoop. That's a High Praise turning ever say that's a high priests. All right, we got it. We got to stop this.

Welcome to The Guiding principles podcast which focuses on the work of visionary educational leaders in an effort to leave all listeners inspired and imparting upon them fresh new ideas and strategies as they continue to expand their own leadership. Toolbox is my hope that this show allows us to connect and grow our educational leadership Community. Now, let's get to this week's episode.  Hey everybody, this is Rob Reiner. And I am the host of The Guiding principles podcast. And today is very exciting as it is episode number one of the show. So to make today even better. I have a special guest on and his name is mr. Daniel Bauer now for those of you who don't know him. Mr. Daniel Bowers the founder of better leaders better schools a trusted blogging category defining podcast for Ruckus makers in education. He helped School leaders fight isolation and frustration through his leadership Community the  Sir mind in order to gain Clarity and find solutions to their greatest challenges. Daniel is also the author of the better leaders better schools roadmap. Let's get talking to Danny and I am excited to get this show going. So like I said, I am super excited today because this is the very first episode of The Guiding principles podcast. And today we have a phenomenal leader on the show and his name is mr. Daniel Bauer and like I said, he's an incredible leader, but he's also a  a friend and a mentor and thank you Danny for helping me get this podcast going and today. I am looking forward to talking to you about everything that you're doing now for those of you who don't know. Mr. Daniel Bauer. Danny has written a book. He has an incredible website. He does a Blog he does a podcast and he also runs what's called a mastermind now Danny. Do you have any seats available in The Mastermind?  I was going out Monday. We are looking for founding members actually of Kelly's cohorts. So I don't know if we'll get into that at all. But currently no but apply because we're opening new groups very very soon. Yeah, The Mastermind program has been very beneficial to me. And if you want a great opportunity to work with some very talented principals assistant principals and other District level leaders. This is a great opportunity and I highly recommend you take advantage of it. I want to get ready.  Book Danny wrote this amazing book called The Better leaders better schools roadmap, and this book was phenomenal in helping me become a better leader. But what I loved is that you release the audio book on Audible and I remember the day you told us that you were releasing. I went out and downloaded the book and the next morning I get up at 4:30 in the morning and I started the book and I started playing it and I'm listening to it and it was like nine o'clock and I got my kids up and so now my kids are sitting down the kitchen.  Table and we're having breakfast together and listen to the book and my wife comes down and goes. What are you listening to him? Like you did? He's finishing up the story here and my wife's like who is Danny and like but the book is so good. And I love the insight and how you expanded upon the thoughts of you already had in your book and that it even more detail to it. What was your favorite part of the book? And what's it like trying to publish a book? Whoa trying to publish is a range of emotions. That's definitely a roller coaster much like you started.  Cass you know, there's a million reasons why you shouldn't because of the fear and the Imposter syndrome Steven pressfield calls that the resistance and that's real anybody that creates art anybody that's a leader who tries to make change happen. And you enter the arena like brene brown would say you're opening yourself up for criticism and they it's it's scary because it could hurt if you pay attention to it. And so you have to you have to ignore that you got to have a group of confidence and people you  Trust and love who have permission to tell you how to level up but you ignore the rest and it's also incredibly wonderful, right because I'm a I'm a big guy about taking action so I coach leaders on creating Vision, right and in establishing goals and then making those things a reality. There's a Japanese proverb. I love that says Vision Without action is merely a Daydream. I don't want to walk around.  Come on zombie right through every single day. Just spouting off that I could do all this cool stuff and never do it. All right. I'm going to make it happen. And I think that's one of my superpowers and something that people respect and maybe admire about me is I'll make it happen. So I've always wanted to write a book. I think the second one is going to be more in a line creatively with what I want to experiment with and try  why but the first one just wanted to be sort of like a love letter to school leaders and in the to help and it was inspired by one of my mentors Seth Godin, you know, I recently finished alt MBA which was an incredible program, but I've been reading Seth in taking online courses that he's been putting out for a while. He's somebody I find very inspirational and his things all about like shipping it like getting the workout and you can iterate and make it better but  Other thing too, is he wrote a free book an e-book called stop stealing dreams, which is about education and at the end he says listen criticize the work make it better or write your own and when I read his I said one day, I'm going to write my own stop stealing dreams. So basically the better leaders better schools roadmap is stop stealing dreams 2.0. I actually sent Seth and autographed copy and said, thanks. I said, I don't need a forward or you know  No, a blurb or anything like that. I just want to say you inspired it you inspire me. I appreciate you and put it out there and then another thing, you know in terms of favorite part. Just seeing it become a reality but you know just serving School leaders and it's an interesting approach. A lot of people don't realize like they think it's going to be just a roadmap. How do you make your organization great, but the first two-thirds of the book, you know is all about you and you have to go on an internal journey and look inside yourself and become the person you need to become.  To then lead at a high level. So I try to take people through that Journey. The last 1/3 is about some things you could do with the structures school organization. And yeah, that's what the roadmaps all about. And that's what I enjoy about your Mastermind program The Mastermind program. It was great because when I got into that  You know you one of the reasons that you talked about getting into doing The Mastermind was because you're trying to get leaders out of isolation Okay, it was interesting cause I remember it wasn't really the first first time I met with the elbows the second and I remember we were discussing something and it was something Chris Jones said and he was talking about an experience that he had in the struggle that he was said that he was going through and what was really interesting because like hearing Chris talk and he's a high school principal. He's got a big school and here I am an elementary school.  Rinsable with a really small school, but our problems were the same. So it was just so interesting and it was Comas relieving to know that you know here other leaders who are going through the same problems that I'm going through. So Danny, how is it that you make other leaders feel comfortable and a follow-up question. That is what do you see as the biggest problem for leaders today? Well, you mentioned part of it the isolation, you know isolations number one enemy to Excellence and isolation really is  a choice to you know, you don't have to do this alone. We're used to doing it alone. The system is set up for us to do it alone. And that's where our leadership Community comes into play. You don't have to you can join us. There's others just like you right people like us do things like this. We connect we call ourselves Ruckus makers your specific cohort is the guiding principles and I like to believe it. You know it becomes  Like a second family, you know because it's it's there's something special when you connect with others who understand your seat. Chris is in a bigger School in you great and higher high school you're in elementary, but he sits in a similar seat and there's something very very special doing leadership in a community week in week out that consistency that authenticity where you you lead in community together.  So that's that's really the magic, you know in The Mastermind. Yeah, and it's really beneficial. But you know, you just mentioned about Ruckus makers. Can you explain what is a Ruckus maker? Yeah Ruckus maker, you know, I named a name the listeners our tribe at better leaders Ruckus makers and that's inspired by Seth to I mean, he's had a huge impact on me, but it's a leader who sees tradition right and breaks free from status quo because we need innovation.  It's a leader who never ever gives up because leadership is hard and you're going to want to mail it in some days, but you can't write your community deserves you to bring it every single day and then a Ruckus maker makes change happen because they're a leader right? And so that's that's how I Define it and I'd like to believe, you know show people that listen to the show leaders like that. They break free from the status quo. They never ever give up. They make change happen. So Danny, can you  Tell us like what is it that drives you? What is your driving force to make you want to do this? It's easy to keep going because I have the best job in the world. Like, you know, I get to work with leaders like you like Chris and like so many others that they you've enrolled yourself. Nobody twisted your arm, right? We there's people we say no to right so not everybody can get in. It's a  So group, it's an elite group and everybody's there chose to be there and they all want to get better. There's some leaders that think they've got it all figured out, but do they I mean everybody can grow. So absolutely that persons not for our community. There's some that are afraid to admit what they don't know right? They're too scared to do that. They're not for our community. So our community is definitely not for the majority of school leaders.  Before that special leader that special Ruckus maker who wants to grow in a family that wants to be real and in get help and level up in the process, you know, we exist. So to be able to do that because you go to The Guiding principles I get to go to them all and no pockets the Purple Cows the free spirits in the guiding principles. And then when Callie I mentioned her I have a great retired superintendent.  Going to start leading Mastermind cohorts. She's leading side by side with me. She's an open up cohorts and we're going to scale that way and serve more leaders. I mean that's impossible. I didn't realize that yeah in in so it's just it's magic. Like I said, I mean I get to serve people that are hungry that have chosen the be there and we talk about stuff that matters. I mean, it's awesome. I don't know how else to explain it like my work is the best and when I'm not  working with you guys and I have a I have a handful of leaders. I coach one-on-one then it's about creating content that's going to serve people right or or thinking about you had the podcast you have the elite Mastermind, but how do you serve more? How do you impact more with the book and now there's the NGO Community right? And so we'll figure things out and continue to add the ways we create value for school leaders. But yeah, that's what we're doing right now. And I mean, it's amazing.  The biggest challenge is just figuring out how to let people know that we exist. Right? Yeah how there are other Ruckus makers that you can connect with and we'll figure that out. I'm not I'm not worried about that because it's working we've run zero ads I've never run an ad in my life and it's all organic. It's all word of mouth. And and to me that that says something really special about what we do because the right people are being  I'm attracted, you know to what we do. Yeah, and and you got a great program. I'm and Kelly's wonderful. She's been a huge help. And yeah yesterday I had is I had an office hours with Kelly and oh good and it got I got to pick her brain a little bit about podcasting. So that was neat and Kelly's been a huge good addition for the program. I think because she's been a good week to go to so so you're constantly growing now you talk about leveling up. Yeah. What does that mean for for typical leader out there? What does leveling?  I mean like how do you define it and then give me an example of what that looks like? Sure. Well, we talked about moving organizations from here to there right where you're not satisfied with the current reality and you see sort of this Promised Land you want to move toward that well that that can happen for an individual as well. So lovely and up is just becoming who you're supposed to be calm as a human being as a leader. It's about investing in yourself, and I've talked on on better leaders. I've talked on the  Leadership series, you know, I put my money where my mouth is, I budget 10% of my income to just grow myself. So that could be conferences. I mentioned the alt MBA program. I took a program to coach the leaders. I serve at a higher level called exponential coaching. I hired a podcast coach. I am right now currently taking a course called finding  Mastery with dr. Michael Gervais and Coach Pete Carroll, right and it's about developing a personal philosophy. It's about Vision grit all this other kind of stuff but doing the things that Elite performers do and that's what leveling up is all about. Everybody can grow right and if you stop growing whew, I've got some serious questions about you if you call yourself a leader like I'll be doing this and trying to level up and  And reading and going to conferences and taking courses. I would hope with one foot in the grave. You know, I don't want to ever stop. There's always something to learn and as I learn then I can serve others right? So I just I'm not ever satisfied with the status quo. So that's what I mean by Loveland up. I forgot the second part of your question. So that leads me to another question then is do you so it sounds like you're saying  Starts with you and you got to keep growing you constantly. If you're going to be a successful and good leader. That is a working definition that I have leadership. Absolutely. It's all about you in, you know, you know and I retire I wrote this in the book I talk about on the podcast Mastermind, but I had that moment going to the Global Leadership Summit in hearing this quote that everybody wins when a leader gets better and then we took that a better leaders and added everybody wins when you Rob gets better, right?  And that quote rocked me because I thought like well, how am I getting better? Number one and I was like, well, I'm at this conference but outside of that one of my doing and now it's also really important. It's a moral imperative. It's a ripple effect because if everyone wins my community who wins just buy me develop in myself that is something I need to focus on and to change the trajectory that you know my life. I love that. So so Danny we got something special for you today.  And so when you signed up is for you to give me a couple people who could give me some information about your leadership. And so today we got Eileen and Eileen sent me a small recording. So I'm going to play it for you get to listen to it. And then I'm going to ask you kind of just reflect on it and give us some give us some of your feedback of what she has to say. You're ready ready? I don't know what to expect but this is fun surely impossible to talk about Danny's leadership and under a minute. He is an amazing leader and it's been fun to see him grow.  Over the past two years. I really cherish our friendship and his mentorship. I don't know anyone who works the smartest hardest Danny he truly practices what he shares with us. He's incredibly disciplined one of the things that makes Danny stand out to me as a leader is his generous here at he gives so much away, especially to us Mastermind members, like coaching sessions or new programs. He develops and he even true it out to see me when I was visiting London.  Ex relationships of her tea and these are just some of the reasons that make Danny stand out as a leader.  And so I mean hearing that that is you I mean you are all about relationships. In fact, I know the other day you were talking about being in Forsyth County and I was like, oh my gosh days here in North Carolina. Like I was trying to figure out how it's going to get up there to come out and see you. I mean, I got four kids at home and I'm like, okay, it's dropping and then you're like, oh no, I'm done Georgia. Well, that's a little bit difference equation ships a huge priority and what you do? Yeah, if I was near you I would have been at your house and we would have been having dinner, you know without a doubt.  Yeah, I got to visit Eileen. You know, she's a she's a fearless leader in China and they were doing a teacher, you know hiring thing in so she was in London. I'm in Glasgow. So that just hopped on a quick flight because I wanted to hang out with her and we got to have lunch. We walked around Kensington Park and it was it was awesome. Good for you Eileen. If you're listening to hit that constraint, you know to keep it brief. I  Of that, you know in the in what you could deliver such a powerful punch even in just a minute. I'm honored. I'm almost you know, I'm talking now, but I am speechless and I just want to say thank you to Eileen. That was very very kind. And they I mean you are one of the most approachable people like I didn't know you at all just found you started tweeting with you and then next thing, you know, I'm talking to you sending e-mails back and forth about what the Mastermind is and getting into Mastermind.  But like I feel like anytime I have something like I could just call and just say Danny. I'm not sure about this. What do I do? Hmm. And even though your you got a hundred different things going on and I mean you go to bed at 3:30 in the morning and you're just you're always moving and doing and your you make things happen, but you always make us feel like were important if we have a question in The Mastermind or anybody in your group has a question like you're right there with an answer and I like I appreciate your time and effort that you put into what you do and you do makes you  guys are the most important to me. I mean, that's just that's just what it is, you know, obviously my family is number one, but you guys you guys are right there and I love I love folks that listen to the podcast, but honestly, I mean The Mastermind is the number one thing and so I have to make you guys a priority because you are that important to me. So yeah, I'll drop anything for you guys if you need help that's  How we roll and we appreciate you for it. And now we have Kathy Jo standefer and here's what she had to say. Okay, Robert, here it goes.  I was in in this is for Danny.  Why I was an instructional leader that knew there was something out there that would challenge my thought process my dedication to education and my beliefs on what would take what could take place in my school? I wanted to meet other Leaders with the same passion for debating ideas and beliefs Danny provides a venue for all of those things Danny provides a safe place for leaders to challenge their beliefs and reflect on plans for a better tomorrow. He has made my  Leadership journey and enjoyable safe and worth every moment of time spent improving ourselves to be better for Education. How do you do? Yeah, how do you make everybody feel so comfortable? I don't know. I'm just myself right? Like the Eileen was first that was Kathy and I've known I've known both of them for a few years now in Kathy I get to work with one on one as well in addition to the Mastermind.  These have to I mean if you're a leader you're in the business of the people business and you have to care about those you serve and I think I don't know what it is about me. I've heard this said before that I'm authentic. And so if we met at a conference, if we met at a pub here in Glasgow, if we met anywhere, I mean, this is just who I am and I love people so let's talk about my personal philosophy. You know, I've been taking this fine.  Mastery course, I'm in the first draft. So this might change in before I took a stoic challenge that was another way. I leveled up in 2019 and you had identify all the character traits that you want to be and then I reflect on them. There's a reminder every day on my phone to read through this list and I have this list of character traits. Then I bowled it down after reading burn a Brown's dare to lead to 3, which was I want to be independent autonomous.  It's I want to be a servant in serve compassionately and I want to be confident and that's me at my best but that was all in my brain and wasn't in my heart. And so then doing finding Mastery. I came on my personal philosophy and I had this aha, how do I get those ideas and get it in my heart and it's changed. This is what it sounds like now that I want to create like an artist love like a poet smile and breathe and like what is that house that a personal philosophy well,  In terms of creativity as an artist. They're pretty independent. They can any canvas. I mean, it's blank you could take it anywhere you want in that creativity aspect whether it's podcast book coaching in the net Independence piece. That's all there, you know with create like an artist love like a poet. Well, I love poetry. I want to be very romantic and intimate with my wife but working with you and you know this I mean The Mastermind I tell you guys I love you because I do but love is  important to me. I want people to feel seen and heard and I want them to know that that they're cared for and they're important and so that love like a poet. That's what it means to me there. Then smile and breathe is just my reminder to myself to Express gratitude often and to be mindful. So to take breaks in the day to walk maybe the meditate to to literally breathe and unplug and then also to be very present like  There's I'm not doing anything else but this podcast right now, right? Some people they might be on a million different apps and you'd probably be able to tell but what are the reasons people feel comfortable and get into that relation ship pieces because of the love and because of the the presence right? And that's that's me at my best. I screw up I will multitask from time to time and that's when I'm not doing it so well, but yeah, that's the personal philosophy and a little bit of how I think I make people feel comfortable.  I was just being myself and try to exude that compassion and yet and you do it extremely well and every time I meet with you like you're right there, you're always present in the moment and I saw your philosophy come up the other day on Twitter. And so I so yeah put that last night because my freaking tooth is hurting some like I might as well tweet something ha ha ha it was so funny. I was like, all right, there it is. And then when you brought it up, I was like, okay. Yeah, so this is and you know, and you do and you are all about the  And we are very appreciative. So and this is Kelly and we were just talking about kelly green and Kelly had this to say about you. Danny bear is one of the most exceptional leaders I have ever met. He is authentic. He is confident and true to his mission and vision.  Leading other leaders and he is a very caring person. Once you meet Danny you feel like you have known him forever and he truly looks out for your best interest and is passionate about helping you grow and learn as a leader. He is someone you can call a friend in this journey of leadership.  so can we had good things to say and you know what Danny like I agree with her like you have the reason that I think that I'm so comfortable immediately calling you a mentor and a friend is because like you have taken that time and like we've had conversations we've done one on one conversations, but it's always just you make people feel so confident and I'm very appreciative and the purpose behind this show is I want to celebrate great things that leaders are doing and I want you to hear  ear  How others feel about your leadership and I want you to leave here knowing that you're greatly appreciated and that you were doing amazing things for leaders. So this is our opportunity. Thank you because the whole idea behind the podcast is to celebrate Creed great leadership out there.

Today is Thursday, November 28th 2019 on this day in 1720. Anne bonny and Mary Read were convicted of piracy and sentenced to hang only to receive a last-minute reprieve they would both be remembered as two of the most famous pirates in history for both their fearsome violence and the fact  act that they were women.  Welcome to today and True Crime a par cast original today. We're covering two of the most famous female pirates in the Golden Age of piracy and bonny and Mary Read after the capture of their ship the William and Captain Jack Rackham. The crew was put on trial. Let us go back in time to 1720s Jamaica at the court where the two women awaited their fate.  The admiralty court was ready to hand down. Its verdict 10 days earlier Captain Calico Jack Rackham had been sent to hang along with four of his crew. The only Pirates left to sentence were Anne bonny and Mary read the two women who had supposedly dressed as men and participated in Jack's heinous crimes tension hung thick in the human.  Island are the crowd jostle trying to get a good look at the two prisoners the women who had committed vicious acts of piracy alongside male counterparts according to one witness Dorothy spin low, these two women were just as vicious as the men in their party wielding machetes and pistols to Menace their prisoners Dorothy's testimony made it clear that these were  and helpless women forced into becoming concubines to a ruthless pirate. These were ruthless Pirates Anne bonny and Mary read held themselves proudly as they were brought in front of the court this despite the fact that their faces were dirty and their clothes hung ragged about them. They gave no indication that they feared what the court had in store for them. The crowd was silent.  one member of the Court stood and addressed the prisoners you marry read and you and Bonnie Alias Bond are to go from hence to the place from whence you came and from thence to the place of execution where you shall be severally hanged by the neck till you are severally dead and God of his infinite mercy be merciful to both your  Souls Bonnie and read exchanged a glance not moving a muscle then they spoke we plead our bellies the court exploded into commotion on Lookers shouted derisively at the women. It was a lie. They were just buying time the admiralty committee members exchanged a glance. This matter had to be  Deled with extreme delicacy the judge ordered both women back to their cell at once as the court discussed the matter the testimony they'd heard throughout the day LED them to believe that these women would attempt to escape the Noose by any means necessary. The court had to be absolutely certain of the pregnancies.  Tests were ordered and local doctors inspected the women. They returned to the court promptly with their verdict the women were indeed both pregnant. Their executions would have to wait.  Coming up. We'll discuss the careers of Anne bonny and Mary Read as well as their eventual Fates now back to the story.  Anne bonny and Mary Read were tried and found guilty of piracy on November 28 1720 by this time there were already two of the most well-known pirates in history, not only because of their gender but also because of the improbable fact that two women disguised as men had wound up on the same ship much of what we know of their lives before taking to the Sea comes.  Book entitled a general history of the Pirates by Captain Charles Johnson. It was published in 1724 four years after an in Mary's trial for piracy in it Johnson claims and Bonnie was the illegitimate child of a respected attorney in Cork, Ireland. Mary read on the other hand was born in England and joined the Navy at a young age while passing as a man.  Though Johnson's book contains a number of embellishments. The following facts are indisputable by 1720 the two women met aboard the ship of Captain Jack Rackham there the trio committed a number of Acts of piracy alongside rackham's crew of nine men historians are uncertain how open Bonnie and Reid were about their true identities some maintain that it open sea they lived as women.  Only donning male clothes went on a raid others claimed that they masqueraded as men throughout their careers as pirates, but all these accounts definitively agree that Mary and Anne were close friends and the Calico Jack was in on their deception after months of sailing with Calico Jack on board his Sloop William Anne bonny and Mary Read found themselves captured and held as prisoners of the crown.  Down along with the rest of the crew Calico Jack was hanged on November 18th in Port Royal Jamaica and most of his crew followed shortly after before his execution Rackham came to visit an Bonnie in prison during which she supposedly coined one of the most legendary farewells in the Golden Age of piracy. I am sorry to see you here. But if you had fought like a man you need not  Have been hanged like a dog unlike their doomed fellows and in Mary still had some cards to play at the last minute. Both of them claimed to be pregnant a practice known at the time as pleading your belly doctors examined them and determined at least as far as medical knowledge of the time could tell both women were telling the truth. The admiralty court granted them a stay of execution.  until after their children were born  But life in the Caribbean during the 18th century held dangers of its own even when not facing the Noose the average life expectancy in this period of History was around 35 to 40 and though Mary Reed was no average woman. She would not defy these odds sometime in the spring of 1721. Mary Reed fell ill and died. She was buried on  28th 1721 by st. Catherine's Church in Jamaica her story lives on in the myths surrounding the Golden Age of piracy.  Anne Bonny on the other hand vanished from history after the trial the closest we get to a hint of her fate comes from the last page of her chapter in Johnson's book. What is become of her since we cannot tell only this we know that she was not executed.  Thanks for listening to today and True Crime. I'm Vanessa Richardson.

Welcome to the Hornet podcast with coaches a Carol. Today's episode is brought to you by Athens screen printing as in screen printing offers t-shirts banners embroidery and trophy Services. No orders are too small or too big. They have a quick turnaround time and our community and locally oriented call them at 9:03 two nine two one seven zero eight.  Now here's coach Harrell.  All right friends. How you doing today? This is Michael. We are in the office of a new head football coach Zack Harrell and the Athens Hornets. How you doing today? Coach, I'm doing awesome. There's nowhere. I'd rather be than sitting right here in Athens, Texas. All right, so we're going to get to the really important things but we got to get this stuff done look but when I was a reporter, they told me to get the most important things first and it's Za see there's no cat. That's right. No kay got that folks know K. So when you start  Wheaton and posting about the coach Za C. That's right. So coach you haven't been here long. Have you been able to like get acclimated to the building find the bathrooms all that good stuff. Oh, yeah, we have and you know fortunately an art situation. I've been on this job since January 22nd, you know, so a lot of times new head coaches get hired and May or June, but me and most of our staff almost all of our staffs been here throughout the  Summer and so we fit really feel like we're kind of ahead of the curve for a new staff. And so we you know, you talked about the building. You can't beat the facility that we have to come to work every day and that we have to serve our kids, you know every day I walk in this place of my man. This is awesome place to work and our kids have every opportunity they can every day to get better. And so we're really blessed in that regard. So it's a beautiful facility and like you said you were here early. So you've actually had a chance to have a  Offseason with the with the team right? Yes, sir. And so what was the summer like in the put in a new program into place has to be a really complicated process right? Even from just how you lift. Yes, sir. And that that was the first thing, you know, like I said, I got here January 22nd. So the first thing we did was, you know, try to change how we work and because we're We Believe  that everything we do we talked about doing things urgently and doing things with great Tempo and that that not only exactly knows and how we practice but that's also in the offseason. So the first thing we did we got here was just teaching these kids of how we go to work every day and how at we approach everything we do we do as fast as we can but we do things right and so the first probably month month  A half we were here. All we did is just try to teach them, you know basic all the way the simple from how we take roll every day to how we approach how we hustle how we run everything we do is fast. We're a quoits fast. We get here fast. We've run out of our cars fast. Everything is fast and Urgent and so we've just really spent a lot of time on that, you know, and again, I kind of alluded to it earlier. I was I was fortunate to be able to bring in three guys with me in the spring.  When we got here, and so that that was huge to kind of get guys here with me that knew how we were going to do things. And so we really felt like it was a great offseason and you know, the other thing we had to do in the offseason was and that we were able to do because we're here so early to start teaching, you know football after we kind of started working because our football philosophy is a lot different than what they've done in the past. And so we really had to start from the basics.  Are and we spent a lot of time in the spring doing that really after spring break on we got the footballs out and started teach it, you know, the mechanics throwing and catching and lining up and all those things just because it's different than what these kids have been exposed to right on time. So they've been a run oriented. All right hands for years and years and years and you obviously are a spread for the ball around kind of philosophy. And so it's totally  Different even as far as lining up how what kind of splits you need where the wide receiver is going to go a lot of motion. I'm sure in your offense. Yes. And so that has to be a really big part of the first year, right and that's not something that's going to end right now. I know I can see that that happens throughout the year, right? And you know, let like you alluded to our philosophy is we want to spread the field and we want to we want to make the fences covers.  Alonzo Lon and so we had to teach our receivers how you know, where do I know based on the play and understanding understanding space and understanding our terminology and then, you know are also people kind of have a think a misconception of what the spread is, you know people saying well just because you spread that means that means you're going to throw it every down and you're going to be Mike Leach and not have many run plays but  but our version of the spread is we're going to spread the field and likes that made the defense cover and then we're going to attack you where you're not defendant and if you're weak in the Box between tackle to tackle, then we're going to run the football and I've been and we're also going to play to our kids strings because I've been places. I've been offensive coordinator for nine years at three different schools and every year our offense looked a little bit different on.  We hung our hat on based on our kids. The beauty of the offense is once you get everybody spread out that you can use your strength against their weakness. You're looking for the matchup. Yes between your offense your defense to try to exploit it and that could look different this year than it does next year in the year after but you're still running the same office. Yeah, you're exactly right and you know a lot of us also based on who you have playing quarterback, you know at van. I was a fan for two years we had kid named.  Garrett mostly played quarterback who was unbelievable High School football player and hey, I think he rushed for almost 4,000 yards and two years. And so we want to run the football when we add in and we could throw we could always throw it enough and that's the other great thing about it is your kids your kids get excited because you involve so many kids and so many different kids are touching the ball at different times and you never know who's going to touch it. And so that's that our kids are really excited and our kids have really taken to it and really you know it  I had a couple people come watch practice last two days. Like how Coaster Day to you know, you're throwing catcher really well, but you know what they don't see and they don't know is like we it's really about moth month five, you know, because we've been we knew that that was a thing that we really had to do in a hurry is because when we got here the first day I kind of joked with people, you know, we threw the balls out and I told our offensive coordinator is also my brother. I told him I said man.  Just based on today. We may have to go back to the wing T because it looked like our kids never caught a ball. But just because you know that they hadn't been exposed to a lot. That's not what they hungry. That's not what they did right now with the practice was and I was lucky enough and thank you for allowing me to come out and check out Monday's practice and I think you threw the ball around the first hour of Monday's practice more than I've seen the ball get thrown in drier season, and that's not  It's just a Different Cloth velocity. You know, I've seen that other offense. I saw last year's offense score like 60 points. Yeah, so right but it's just a different philosophy. The other thing that really struck me about Monday's practice was the level of enthusiasm and it was really a very high-energy practice. Right? And that's what you know, we really preach that and we want our kids to know.  Know that hey we're going to work extremely hard and we're going to coach our but we're out here to have fun. And if you're not out here having fun, then you're going about this the wrong way and we really try to you know, start that off with our coaches and I tell our coaches every day and we we are very blessed here at Athens. You're not going to find a better coaching staff from top to bottom that we have here and these guys, you know, every single one of our culture our high-energy guys and  Our kids are going to see that from us first because we believe if we don't we don't set the tempo then our kids aren't going to follow and enthusiasm is contagious. We say that all the time and so we want to attack practice every day with that mindset of bringing a lot of energy having fun being loud going fast. And that's just that's just how we how we approach it everyday. So we've got some time we're going to try and do this podcast every week. So we got some time to get into some of the  X and what's going on and all because you don't have it you don't even have a scrimmage for another couple of weeks right next Friday next Friday night this Friday next Friday, but one thing we hear all the time about your spread offense and everything else. I don't know anything about your defense what I under the defense. Are you going to have what? Yeah, it's a great question. That's you know, you hit our men ago, you know last year they score a lot of points and that we got a lot of talented guys back on offense. And so we really think that  Office can be really good again, but you know, you go back and watch last year where they struggles on defense silent ball and that's what really one of the first things when I got here. One of the first things I did was I tried to find the best defensive coordinator and the state of Texas that I could find and I had that first week that I was on the job. I interviewed. I had a lot of people calling because a lot of people are excited by Athens football and I interviewed Five Guys that first week and I really think we found one of the best guys that that's out there.  Are we hired a guy named Kane and kitchens are defensive coordinator. He came from beloved Cooper to five a school in Lubbock and they've been you know, a lot of people out here probably don't know about him. But you follow High School football. They've been one of the best 5A schools and state of Texas the last since he's been there and it's because they play great defense and so he we believe in a weak base out of a four to five defense kind of TCU look and but we're going to be very  on defense will go keep offenses guessing, you know, because from I've I'm an offensive guy and so from offensive perspective when you know, what causes us to most difficulty is when people when we don't know what they're going to do and so we're going to be multiple but at the same time we believe that our kids need to be very confident of what they're doing on defense because great defense to us and to me is playing with a like we've already  talked about is playing with a ton of energy and running through the football and swarming the football and having 11 hats playing really hard. And so that that's how we expect our defense to play and that's how coach catches those defensive guys. We're going to have our guys play in and you know, we we've made some Personnel moves and we made sure that we made make sure the defense the priority here and some kids in the past. They might have had priority offensive.  Those are going to have bigger roles on defense because we got to play great defense if we want to if we want to be great. So you use the word multiple a couple of times in let's explain for those who may not understand you're talking about your fronts. Yeah, so that you may come out and a four-man front. Sometimes may come out in the three-man front so that the other team doesn't know where the pressure has come about front. I'm talking about secondary. So I'm talking about you know, like you said we're going to base the first thing we do.  Teach the four-man front board going to teach our kids how to move and have now dropped one of those guys off as an outside linebacker and have a three-man front that way offense is don't know okay here they're going to sit in the four-man front so we know exactly what we need to run. So keep them guessing up front. Yeah. So the day the days of were a 4:3 and that's what you're going to see right every play. Those are pretty much gone. They're different. Yeah now again, we're going to but we're going to base we're going to be in a format front more than anything but  We're going to keep up its gas and and I also think supporting on the back end the secondary we're going to be indifferent cover. We're not going to sit out there and and two safeties ever down and play cover forever down. We're gonna we're gonna roll we're going to spin we're going to move kids around and keep it offenses guessing one of the one of the nice things about philosophy like that is you give your athletes more of a chance to get involved because you've got more guys  I hate that term right because he's okay. You're a football player, but you even see it when you're looking at the draft or people to sign in with colleges at all. They call him an athlete instead of saying what position they all right? Yes, and it seems to me watch it on Monday. You have a lot of those kind of kids out. Yeah. I'm sure right. Yeah, we do. We think that again that we got a we know it's going to take time to build a program where we want it but make no mistake about it. We think we got the pieces, right?  This year the big to be a great football team and that's our goal. We're not we're not here to say I am three years. We're going to do this. We're talking to these guys right now. We expect to be great and because we got a lot of talented kids and we were really excited about about this team. So we're works out. All right guys, so we're going to let Coach go because he's got a lot of things going on. We will be back next week, but listen in between  I mean make sure you follow on Twitter coach's guide a great Twitter account for the football team. It's at Hornets Athens.

And I'm like, oh, I know her brother actually like she sent you like during the summer because you know, this happened in May. Yeah. Yeah and then use it for that our house almost like every other night during Ramadan. Yeah, and I was like, oh her brother was just like here last night. But yeah now we get to beat the whole fam we met your grandma too. Oh my God, I wish you the best.  The sweetest lady and she does like she did is like, I'm our neural. What did she do? She puts her what's her her career? I was she did geology. Yeah geology. I'm pretty sure my geology. Yeah. She was like a professor and I'm pretty sure it's geology geology. I was geology and I think you talked about her aunt laughter - All right, I like about my aunt. Yeah, because that your aunt. Well, yeah because that day for she's OB. Yeah. She's obviously Jordan because we went we went to your house.  It's like this was a year ago know, is that what you probably my my grandma for sure o sweetest lady. She's so cute. I love her. I don't know how y'all do it. Everyone's super successful and on their shit and making it till you make it man. I'm telling you. Oh, yeah for sure honestly. No, I mean because I saw when I saw you guys are like asking for people to come on. I thought it'd be a really great opportunity to kind of talk about activism just because it's not something that I get something that we're all super aware.  Especially within the ottoman Muslim communities and with everything going on right now, but it's not something that people tend to talk about for some reason you're right unlike which is perfect for us. Exactly. And so I was like, you know what like I don't mind biting the bullet and just shooting my shots and if you guys wanted me to come on and just talk about this because you know, you guys are Palestinians and activism is a really big things. Oh, yeah and swish now you're here. You should know shot work at did honestly  Honestly first time I shot shot my shot and it worked so well, I don't know one was thinking those we're accepting everyone but you said something on in your one of your post screaming Instagram, right? Yeah, and it was exactly paralleled why we started this podcast and I'm wondering because you said what was the quote? Could you read the quote on the notes?  Yeah, you said growing up as a no-talking Muslim, you know white Community. I had to work harder to be taken just as seriously as everyone else from a young age. I mask my insecurities and lack of confidence by overachieving. First of all, I love how open you are about that. Thank you. Is that something we strive to do is to be open and honest because that's really hard to admit and we for me personally we started this podcast because we didn't have a platform to relate to as kids. I grew up in an all-white High School.  I know a lot of yeah, so I had I didn't have a platform. There was no like sort of role model in the media to look up to and every yeah that influence you heavily as to be active and to do a speech like that. Oh hundred percent like I mean the same thing girl, I went to I went to park way but like Parkway was like for the most part they're like what five six Muslim kids like, I think I was the only are talking for a really long time and I didn't have  I had people who like kind of got me but like not really and so for me I kind of realized that I have this personality. I'm not afraid to speak out. I'm not afraid to like just speak publicly and like to share my opinions and thoughts and I know that like a younger version of myself could have really used someone like me, right which is exactly why I like as I've grown up and I've become more confident with myself and you know that fake self.  Dance turned into real self confidence. I thought this would be perfect for somebody who is younger like my cousins who are 13 and 14. Like I know they could probably use someone like myself or like you guys are a podcast like this. And so that's kind of what was the initial I think drive to just do what it is that I'm doing because I get people sending me messages commenting on like my Facebook or Instagram. So whatever especially after like the speech and everything saying like you've inspired me to do XY and Z and  That's an amazing feeling but it's also really validating for like what it is that I'm doing and what like what Jackass kind of stands for I could prove that I could imagine because that blew up. Yeah, that was crazy. By the way. Are you sick about talking about it or can we totally bug you? I don't you can totally like, I mean, I don't mind talking about you can bug Beach just for me was so surreal because that was the last thing that I was expecting to happen. Like I literally just wrote this speech one night when I had really bad jet lag when I was visiting family in Kuwait and it just came from the heart.  And I actually had no idea that it was going to get picked to be the undergraduates speech because I didn't think it was good enough. Yeah, and it did and then I just that's crazy. Yeah, like I had no idea that it was going to go you shot to shot. Yeah. I did you're shooting threes all this is crazy. That's crazy. So I forgot I wasn't asked.  Ask if she's getting sick of oh, but you but you're not sick of it, but I wanted to say so you went into it not even thinking that this was going to be the outcome. Oh, just no not at all like the I just wrote the speech because I had a story and I wanted to share that story and I was really motivated to be the undergraduate speaker because I actually found out like both my brother and I are graduation ceremonies where we would get our diplomas were the exact same date and time and so I was trying to figure out  Way, we're like my parents could attend both my graduation and my brother's graduation and I was like, okay, I'm going to submit this speech see if it happens and if it works out, you know, I'll get to give the speech and my parents can go to use of graduation first and then come to Boston to see me give the speech would be more important than it actually worked out and then kind of blew up from there, which is crazy. Yeah, because we I mean when we started this park as we got we got 270 followers, it's small at the same time the amount of  good reactions that we got. Yeah, it's crazy. We were so surprised and then looking at how big the video and the speech was that you did. I couldn't even imagine the amount of support and the amount of comments. Yeah. Not a message is you're probably getting could you talk about that? Yeah. So for like a good three weeks, I woke up every single morning to like 30 40 messages in my inbox people finding my email like finding me on Facebook commenting on like the very  very public posts that I have on Facebook and like just saying things like yes mean, you know, you are amazing or like one of the my favorite comments that I've ever received with somebody saying like used to mean you've distilled water like the water of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and like saying, I'm the 21st century queen of Babylon, I've made yeah like they like Iraqis were saying like we you've made us so proud and you know, thank you for  For making us proud of who we are and for being exactly what the world needs to see and just all of these like I was so humbled because I had no idea that my words had that kind of an impact. Yeah, and I didn't think that they would and the craziest thing was the fact that so many people related to it which was because I just didn't I you know was just my story. I didn't think that my like my store would be as relatable as it was and just to see that it influenced so many people and  Such a positive way and like validated whatever experiences that they were dealing with them struggling with and gave them Hope was on real and like I'm so thankful for it for all of the messages and everything. I receive from every person it almost seems like our people are starving for that kind of perspective so much that whenever they actually finally see it. Yeah. It's like the the the support is like almost overwhelming. It's yeah, it's kind that goes hand in.  In hand with Arab activism because I'm sure like because it's like you don't see like a lot of atoms out there. I mean a lot of us are doing really great things. But I feel like nobody focuses on that because it's not attractive or it's not it's not what like the Western media wants to show about atoms and Muslims. Yeah. And so when we were able to break those barriers and somehow go viral or for something to like go big it's the best thing ever.  For our communities because finally there's somebody out there doing something and showing the world like what Adams and Muslims and all like what we're really like rather than what certain groups are certain types of people are the media kind of wanted to pick this as yeah. I think that's an important point to that. There are there is the are people doing amazing things. Yes, you don't we're not told about it exact not in the spotlight. Exactly. And yeah, you do have to break out in like a weird viral way to you even to be able to notice the  So what inspired you to to end with free Palestine and black lives matter? So basically like around the time it was I think the great return March that was like when those Friday protests were kind of starting because of the what was going on and it has the and so I knew that the crowd was going to be supposedly about 27,000 people and I kind of thought you know with what's going on and  Have this platform. I've got to say something and I was contemplating for weeks. I was like talking to sex out of my close friends. Like guys you think I should do this. Like you think I'll get in trouble. Like do you think like trolls are going to come out after me and try to like ruin my job prospects. So like whatever is going to happen and I was like, they told me to think about it. Maybe you should do it. You know, you're probably you're going to have your diplomas like why not and I thought to myself. Let's see how I feel when I'm on stage and  And as I was giving the speech I was feeling myself and the fact that our commencement speaker was John Lewis. I was like, all right, this is perfect. And I just decided to say it like know my family had no idea that I was going to say it. Nobody really had other than a couple of close friends. Yeah. I kept really tight because I knew if my parents found out they then they kissed me. They're like, no don't don't you dare but I was like, you know what screw it like, I've got my diploma the university can't do anything to me at this point, and it's  Like this is the only opportunity that I'll be able to have to speak to so many people and it's kind of like my duty as an activist, you know, when you're given a platform that big you've got to go all out. And so that's what I decided to do and I just bit the bullet and did it. Yeah any backlash from the University or oh, yeah for sure. I got a lot of people like saying some really nasty things to me was that like actual faculty or was that just like random people often random people were saying like found like just as positive things were sent to me a lot of  of things when my way as well one of my best friends. She worked at the dean of students office and she was telling me that literally for the last like the couple days are weeks after it happened the university received so much hate like donors called to like yell at the University a lot of people withdrew funding. Yeah, so people were not happy but like the the fact the universe you can really do anything.  To me because I'd already gotten my diploma. Like I they had no idea that it was going to be said so they couldn't necessarily punish me but I think the university received some backlash and I'm pretty sure come next year. They're going to be very careful as to who says what like the whole wedding process sort of thing. That's crazy. Yeah. Well, it was crazy about money. Yeah. I know, you know Money Talks that I bet there is but the but you didn't receive any sort of nausea Mentor any no I didn't receive any punished because how  Like they couldn't do any first. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, I don't know how it works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right though. You got your diploma. You're out of there exactly where they going to like if I had a summer course if I had to stay at for another semester, I probably wouldn't gotten a lot of trouble but nope and at the same time the you didn't receive hate or anything from The Faculty or know, I like some some of the professor's were actually like really impressed with it remember watching the video because they looked like happy about it. I see I saw some of the people lined up behind you. Yeah. Yeah, there was one.  Is tonight in particular I think was really happy because I was checking on Twitter after it happened and they tweeted something being like like a student said like the commencement speaker said black lives matter like rock concert some sort of thing. So I think they're pretty happy about it surprisingly. Yeah, it was cool. You're not gonna talk about how you're politically active and optimizations. And yeah, where's all that passion coming from and being like I know for our herbs like, you know being an eye doctor an engineer is like the way to go because that's how  Parents view success, but with you you're taking this route. That's just like, you know, your parents are not like happy about but like, you know, they're just kind of letting us do what you do. So what what are you involved in? What are you what's inspiring you to all these kind of things. So I think the like I was raised just like if anything if I ever saw anything bad to speak out and so just that kind of has always stuck with me. And so what I do to say politically active like in call, I mean I'm a  I'm less politically active now that I'm out of college, but I was involved in a lot of like leftist groups. I guess they're like a lot of my friends were really politically active and so we weren't necessarily part of like specific organizations, but we were the kind of people that knew what was going on in our communities and would have these kinds of discussions and like show up to different protest or different events or things like that. So I  like I was a part of students for justice in Palestine when I was an undergrad and yeah, I guess like there are particular groups. I guess that I would say I'm a part of but it's just so consistently surrounding myself by attending events keeping with like staying kind of up to date with what's going on, you know using social media to kind of be able to learn and read like read more and also just genuinely just personal education just like reading I guess so, yeah, I don't know.  Answers that foot so why do you think activism is important? I mean because it's just it's going back to them what I was taught as just if you ever see anything wrong, you know, you got to speak out and as an auto as a Muslim like I want to be treated equally and I know with people within my community want to be treated equally as as well and if we don't stand up and speak out, you know for other groups and also for our own groups, how do we expect any change to kind of  Button, and so like well, so I'm rambling a bit not like there's no true. But like it's just  Anytime like you want change to happen, you know, it's not just going to happen. Like you've got to work towards it. And so it's so important that we have people with like within our own groups, you know, speak out like myself or you know people from other marginalized groups just speaking out to kind of give like agency to the cause or to kind of give a voice to it and what kind of wood in terms of activism like  What does it mean to you? What does it mean to be active or be participating in activism or to be promoting change? Like what does that look like? What does it mean to you? I think it takes a lot of different forms, you know, like there are people who are down to be in the front lines like at the protest, you know who aren't afraid to get arrested like that's definitely activism. But I also think it could be somebody who you know may not feel who someone who may not feel comfortable, you know being in the front line.  As they may be afraid, you know to get arrested or for example, their parents may not let them go out. Like if they want to go to a protest, you know taking it to social media to share what they think is right or to educate other people. It could just be attending events and just kind of keeping yourself up to date. So, you know, like you're aware of what's right and what's wrong so you can speak out whether that means amongst your friends like for example, if your I don't know just hanging out with  People and some people say some kind of problematic thing and you know, what's kind of wrong you tell them. Hey, like that's not cool like that. I think is a mine like a very minor form of activism, but I think it's just it can be anything from being on the picket lines getting arrested to just you know, educating those around you that you may feel comfortable with just because people have different Comfort levels people like exactly so there's different levels. Yeah. There's a lot of  Levels to it. I don't think there is because I don't think there's one way to kind of subscribe to activism until like what it is. Right and it's kind of interesting because I mean the whole like political shift that happened in the Middle East. Yeah and like in 2011 with entire Square we're was started by college students, you know, we're in like him left. He is kind of groups and it grow to be like this massive thing. So what why do you think that why do you think it's just it always starts with the youth or college students, you know, nothing like colors are like the ones  And using these kind of think about it. They're like a catalyst right there. Yeah used for like and specifically I can follow us tonight. I mean, I know it happens in Egypt with the Brotherhood so like a 1928 or something and it was like some college student. I just wanted, you know, something different other than fighting colonizers and stuff. He wanted like more of like a conservative group and that's why he funded the Brotherhood but that's besides the point. And for the scene in bed. Is that aren't if you've had a busy. Yeah, so they use their kind of SGA.  as like a political kind of like  Yeah, this is like like how are the political spectrum is in Palestine their kind of student government body kind of replicates that so whenever there's like, you know advocates for like I mean, there's a lot of I guess favor for the chemist and then you see like the student body like, you know replicate that light can be like more conservative and stuff. So why do you think there's a lot of with that's where it starts why is college campuses the youth is where allowed this activism kind of begins? I think it's because when you're  you know, you've got all this energy and like you're figuring yourself out and you're kind of exposed and you're given a lot of Independence in a way that you're not usually, you know, used to receiving like when you're younger, for example for me like my activism really did start in college and I can say it was because I was exposed to new environment and there is all I was getting exposed to all these new ideas and I finally had this Freedom so I think it's because of the fact that you have freedom you have the freedom  Um to experiment to experiment with thought to be able to kind of go about and do kind of whatever you want to do without restraints of like parents or like what people might say is like socially acceptable or not and also and it's just like youthful energy I think is one of the biggest things as well. That's Rising. Yeah, it's almost like we're not beaten by beating down by life yet. Yeah, so we're almost like we're always like optimistically  We have the optimistic energy. Like we can make a change and everything because I wanted to say because you're you may important point on your speech. You said it had you told your parents. They would have been like no do not do that. Yep, because fear and risk and they don't know the outcome. Thanks. Why do you why do you think I guess not. Why do you think but like that's a that's a real thing. What do your parents think of it after the fact my parents are very proud of it. Like my mom actually, it's really cute. Like she'll check to see how many views it has. She's like. Oh my God, he's Mia.  Like did you see that has this many views now because she's super proud of it. And my dad also is like super proud of it and super impressed and just amazed to see that. You know, I was able to kind of share my story but do it in a way that kind of changed the game or change the world in a sense and so obviously in hindsight there like they're super happy that I said what I said, but obviously like they wouldn't have wanted it to happen and it  You see how it works. Yeah, that's exactly you see how it works. I don't really know why that's the case but like that is because it's so bring the focus back to us items here in the u.s. Yeah, what role should autumns play in promoting our culture and our faith using activism. I think, you know items need to be more present and more active because I have this I feel like the community there are people who are  politically active and there are people who are involved but like that's like 5 or 10% and I feel like it's like Adams and a lot of Americans are very subscribe to like certain issues. Like obviously follow stain as a huge one. We're like everyone shows up everyone cares about it, but then comes like black lives matter, you know, people don't people then start to kind of back away from it and they're not interested or they're like, I like I don't it doesn't really affect me. So like why should I  Up. Why should I care? And I think like with that for example, I mean like a third of American Muslims are are black and so it does affect you in a certain sense if you're out of because you probably have Muslim friends if you're not a Muslim and like you've got like, you know, black people, you know, you're kind of surrounded by it like it because it indirectly affects you should still care about it. And I think like autumns need to not have Americans need to kind of realize that if  an issue doesn't directly affect them. They should still care about it because like atoms we have our own issues, you know, we get discriminated against especially like post 9/11 posting Iraq War era, like people don't really like us and if we want to be treated the same way as everybody else and given the same respect, you know, we have to show up for other for other groups because I'm a firm believer and I think like a lot of people may agree should agree with her. I think a lot of  I agree with this that if one group isn't free or isn't given the same respect, you know, all marginalized groups aren't free like nobody's free. So, when do you know when to be an ally or went to like, you know, just pass the mic to someone whose voices are marginalized run heard like how do you know when to do when an especially for us autumns right? I think we do have somewhat more of a privilege than black people for sure. Yeah. So that's a really good question and I think  Like specific, I guess to Black lives matter. Like if you're not black, you know, you got to take the back seat like you can show up and you can support and you can say hey I am here for you. Whatever you need. I can provide that that's how I would say to be an ally and if somebody was to come up to you or like a media person, you know knew that you were an activist or like for example for media person came up to me knew that I was an activist and wasn't  Off of black lives matter and wanted to get my opinions on it. You know, I would kind of deflect and be like, hey first I think you should talk to like X y&z person who's black because their opinion actually matters more on this issue than I do. So kind of acknowledging Your Privilege as an auto been as somebody who's not black and you know taking a step back from that and just like s providing support whenever they need it, but making sure that you're not taking over the spotlight.  Makes yeah, I don't expect to find people with more perspective than yourself an expertise. Yeah, exactly experience. And I think you made an important point in your previous statement where you said, we don't show up to I got up specifically we don't show up to other people's issues are protester. I don't get it. I'm not really sure either way. It's very interesting. Actually. We're back about up but up. This wreck is our friend and kind of had like something similar to this in the past like what cast? Yeah.  And this is politically walk. She knows. Yeah, she knows what's going on. So there was like a Syrian Port as that was happening here in Saint Louis. Yeah and thing like a couple months before there's another Palestinian protest and in the policy and put us like most of the Palestinians even the community came out and it was like a huge crowd. But when a Syrian ports as happens, no pal scenes where they're very small crowd and like no representation from like the Autumn Community here in st. Louis to support the Syrian cause yeah, so why do you think that is why I mean this is probably a pal.  Singing issue, but like an upscale. Do you eat do you think Palestine is victimized themselves more than they need to be too kind of like, you know get more support for whether that's a hard question because I don't know how to answer that because I don't want to like cuz I'm not Palestinian so I can write say like do Palestinians victimized themselves. I think like I think it goes back to because the issue doesn't directly affect them. Mmm. They're like, oh what's the point of a showing up like this?  Like I'm not as driven to come out and I think that's where the problem lies. Yeah, it's it just goes back to the whole if it doesn't directly affect you like you're just not going to come you're not going to show up because what's the point right? Did you think that's like a the leaders in the communities kind of fault? Yeah where they're not like kind of like walking off to you know, hold people accountable and to like have representations from like other communities. I guess. They're honestly, I think it deals with  it could be like this. I want to say not racism because I don't know if atoms can be racist towards like other items in this Prejudice. Yeah, that is a better word where it's like we like it typically is, you know, I'd always think that they're better than all other Arabs and like like every other and like I think that's probably what it is where it's like, oh, I really only care about  Palestinians because I'm Palestinian and like sure see what's going on in Syria is rough. But like, you know, we got it all so bad in Palestine. So like we should care about that because actually, I mean one of the pieces like one of the Backlot backlash that I got for my speech actually from a lot of iraqi's was the fact that I said nothing about you rock when I was like, oh I said like free Palestine and black lives matter. They like what about Iraq? Like, you know, we've got like shit going on too. Why don't you say anything about that and I was like,  Like my response to them like my love my parents and I were discussing back because my dad brought that up to he's like you should have said that I was like, you know sure what's going on there is bad, but I think this issue takes more precedent because of its timely it's more its it needs like a spotlight. And so I think that atoms tend to lack that perspective of you know, recognizing when one issue I think is more important than the other if that makes sense.  Seems like we all have it honestly underbellies. It's like we all have it so bad that it's like we're in scarcity and we have to like focus on our own things but realize if we like if we actually did focus on each other. Yeah, it would compound and everyone would have a voice exactly like I think people tent like it's just it's like, oh, woe is me. I have it worse than you like everyone's trying to prove how they have it worse than each other rather than kind of realizing like, oh, we all have a bad like why don't you night and like  recognize that like, oh if you like it'd be so much more powerful if like all the Palestinians in St.Louis came out and supported Syria support. Syria has been like the cereal I call if all the syrians came out, you know to support that like that sort of thing. What is what is the state of Arab activism in the US and I because in my in my view is like, I don't know if has there ever been a time in the Middle East specifically where we've been more divided as out up. I would almost think like no this is have been like the worst.  First division between other items in history with everything that's going on. I'm I could be wrong. That's just a thought but where do you think Arab activism is now and especially the st. Louis area because I've been I've been sort of politically  Apathetic my whole life and getting into this I'm starting to like yeah, this is nice actually feels good like this. Am I I do I can't make a difference like I do have a voice in like it actually feels good just to do it. Yeah, whether or not I'm making huge changes or not. I don't even care. I just feel good about doing exactly so where do you think we are now, I think in terms of Arab activism like for Arab Americans and the state's I think it's getting better. And I think it's because conversations are happening.  Meaning and people are starting to realize like, you know, we need to unite like we actually are getting targeted more especially with like the current Administration and all this stuff going on like Arabs are starting to realize we got to do something because it's getting to a point where like if you don't do anything, it's just gonna get worse and I think and I think in st. Louis, I also think it's getting better. Like I'm not saying it's amazing because it's definitely not but I think  People are getting more and more aware and more woke because we kind of have to be because the pressures building exactly and it's kind of a shame that it's taking like this pressure to kind of make it happen when it should inherently just be there because like, I mean as Muslims like it's in our religion to kind of be activists Olmos and for sure and like culturally are we have this mentality of like, you know, we got to be good people we have to stand.  Through what's right and so and I think it's a Louis it is it's getting better as well. I think they're people are starting to organize more. I think that with like this podcast, I think with the fact that their universities here, like going back to the original like an earlier point that you made my day about the fact that like a lot of activism kind of stems from universities like the fact that there are universities here and there a lot of young people like people are starting to get more and more.  Of but I think there's still a lot more room for growth. Oh, absolutely. What were do we compare on the map to like a Chicago to like a New York? Tyler? Very small. So yeah. Yeah, you can't I feel like it's like comparing like apples to oranges sort of thing. That's like like I think obviously like Chicago New York Boston because I can speak for Boston like it's super super politically active. Is it really? Yeah, so I have no idea. Yeah. What's it like so Boston?  I want to say it's largely in part of the fact that like there's so many universities in Boston. So there's so many young people that there's always stuff going on like any time anything is ever like happened. There's always been a protest whether it's like five people showing up and like are they and carrying signs to like thousands of people showing up and I think the same can be said in New York and Chicago la like all the big cities. Yeah youth is our huge thing for like  for activism. Yeah, it's all these things like all these initiatives and all these like, you know protest on these things are, you know start with the youth and it's especially like an audit world because it's like that's almost an intellectuals and people who are like care about these kind of issues. That's where they go on discussing them talk. You know, that's that's their space. Yeah, and I mean, I don't know like st. Louis here. It's like that big really have an SJP here, but I do have to say though like looking because a couple years ago when black lives when the block  Matter protester a big thing. I remember coming out when the hot like the highway shut down. Yeah, and like that was I mean that was a very beautiful like moment in terms of st. Louis activism and I specifically remember seeing a lot of Palestinian people actually showing up. I was yeah like there were there were tons of Palestinians out there protesting like I saw so many kaffirs and I was like this is and I think because for me like that was a really big  Big part of kind of what kick-started my activism was black lives matter. And so I think maybe for like the state of Arab Americans and Arabs in St.Louis specifically like I think like that's all you're good good. Okay, cool. Like I think the same can be said for those as well because like that there were a lot of Palestinians and I think other Arabs who showed up for that too. Why do you think we were late so much that a black lives matter movement. Oh, I wrote a paper on this. Yes. Tell me.  I think is the the the struggles are very similar. It's a fight for Liberation. It's a fight for you know, just the will like the freedom to live to be accepted, you know, a lot of police brutalities of big thing like with black folk in America. They've struggled with a lot of police brutality and I think the same can be said instead of police. It's the military the IDF and I think there's like  it's and it's almost that it's the state going and fighting against the people and I think that's kind of what Bridges the two together. And so I think I think that's like the major similarity between the two. Yeah. It's interesting because I grew up in the blood and like in the wake of the second intifada is when we came here. Yeah and going to the Ferguson protests and all these things were happening. It's it was like a parallel reality.  be between being there and witnessing like the police force coming in with like their gear and like throwing smoke grenades and spot bombs or whatever and going to use for our thoughts compound and I'm on Law and you know seeing literally we had these guys from factor that would come to our school with masks and until I was like you need to go to his compound to like, you know defend his like place and you know throw rocks at the IDF and stuff and you know, seeing how the IDF we Act  when we got there and then seeing how Ferguson Police reacted when the protesters were were all there it was like so surreal and I felt like I was back in Ramallah like a quick second because I remember when I was in a situation where it was paralleled but like it felt what I saw in the news and like what I saw people like people posting and Palestine it just it felt like that I was there to like  Was you know five feet away from me. I saw people just peacefully sitting down and like just being civilly disobedient I guess is the right way to say it and getting beaten by batons because they wouldn't move but they couldn't move because they were maced in the face so they couldn't even see and it was just crazy to see I was crazy to see that and and as you said like that's that was the reality back in full of seen as well. So if you want to know something crazy  a ironic so whenever them  The Kali case happened here. This was like last year like the year before stock only one. Who's that God? I can't remember the his name Mike. Oh the one who was the he was on wasn't like death row are some yeah, something like that. Anyway, there was all these protests Happening Here in Saint Louis. And there was one in in such a West End where they marched to Linda Carlson's the mayor to her house because like, you know, she was not really doing anything.  NG and there was like a role of police officers like blocking the road from like people. Yeah, the one right here and everything and oh my God, I wish that if and if I can like wish for one thing it would be like to take the video that we recorded. So I took my phone and I put it like next to the curb and like a little like no one was like daring like to come close to those guys in the right gear and why phone down and recorded a video of me walking up and sitting right in front of those police officers this riot gear.  And like I'm just looking at them and I'm like I'm having flashbacks of like, you know me meeting like the hood for the first time and now like I just walked back and I took my phone my phone turned off and then the video was like never like saved. But anyway, no, I know it was like I wish that would've been sick video. But anyway, so like, you know, they wait until I call the protesters got there and then they you know, sort of like throwing smoke grenades and stuff and like everyone like we're running for their lives and it's like there was a synagogue at the  the street and they told everyone to go into the synagogue. So like, you know, they want to arrest anyone. It's like I'm sitting in front of the in the synagogue and it's just a bunch of like, you know white people black people and they're all like being house and they're giving us free food free like drinks and stuff and we were little then till like 3:00 in the morning because like anyone that would walk out of think I would have been arrested so I can synonyms. Like wow like this is exactly happening fellas don't have like these Jews are like saving me  From like, you know, especially being arrested and stuff and like in the blood it just I don't know it was like this weird ironic thing that I was just like yeah, you're just like what do I do believe in? Yeah what is going on? But it was it was insane. Yeah, that's but okay. So like just to go back switch gears here. We always like this is always thrown I was like attacking for the right like, you know going to protest and going to all these things. It's like, you know, I was because I was recording all the videos on live and stuff and I was like, what are you doing go home like, you know some of our other  Sounds like this is nonsense, whatever it's always exist attack you fall you like, you know, who cares about these things, you know, it's not affecting us look so why do why do I bother so what's the most effective way for us to partake in activism? What's something that should like? Okay, we should just you know do it this way. We should protest we should you know, focus on policy. We should, you know, become politicians or I think what it comes down to is educating yourself. I think that's the very first step and the most  current is just being aware of the issues understanding what's going on understanding why it's wrong and educating Yourself by talking to different members of marginalized groups and knowing the history. I think of activism is super important like reading, you know, anything like Malcolm X and Angela Davis like any like any of these like huge figures, you know, reading what they have to say like for me that was really big because it made me realize the importance of like  Intersectionality and the importance of like voicing my thoughts and my opinions and I think just not being afraid to have uncomfortable conversations with like your friends and you know not being afraid to get serious with your friends because I feel like out of see, you know, like we don't we don't like to have these serious uncomfortable conversations when it's pertaining to issues that we might not really understand or like that. We might not  relate to I think knowing what's going on in the community. Like if there's a protest going on, you know, if you are able to go show up like get friends like make a kind of a social thing. I think that's like maybe making activism fun in a way enjoyable. Yeah, like enjoy like as in like getting just get some friends to go like and to have fun because I think like are not have fun. But like because I think once enjoyed  Process enjoy the process because like you were saying like just having these conversations. I like having this conversation has is making you feel good. Thanks. And I think riding on that high is super super important and I think it makes it enjoyable in a sense and kind of is what would keep people going. It builds momentum exactly even just sitting out here. Yeah, I'm feeling it. So why do you think the community is like super critical of people who are like engaging in these things are hard.  like active part of me is because it's like it's like people think it's a of like for example, I mean like I'm  Honestly, like for a girl to go like I remember when the when the Ferguson protests were going I oh, yeah, I begged my parents to let me go. I was like Mama Baba, please. Let me go to Ferguson. Like I know it's scary. But like it's so important that we show up and my parents were like absolutely not like there's no way that you're gonna go like a girl like you going out in the streets like this. Like I think it's because yeah, it's just it's I have like they're like someone else can do it like you don't need to do it and I think that's the  mentality that a lot of Arabs have is  We know someone's going to show up. So that's so there's no need for you to so like I think trying to combat that and go over it. Yeah, that mentality. Like here's what everyone like even like with voting right? Like, oh my vote is not going to count. You know, someone else will vote. It's like, I mean, that's how a lot of us. I'm being honest with you like literally my entire life. I have been politically apathetic up until like I got the college just like and that can change like it can change at any point like it's never too late and I think  I think it's like if you can accept the fact that it may not change the world like maybe kind of have like a smaller goal or like think, you know if I can influence one person. Yeah, that's all you need to do. Yeah, you're right coming from my own perspective. Like I'm like if I can't change everything that I'm not going to do nothing like I don't like I like but how lower my expectations exactly because this is this is some you build into and you growing  And I I don't know why I thought like that. Like I had to do massive amounts of work and changed or else it's not worth it when it's really that's not the case at all. That's a terrible way to think about it. Yeah, it's definitely a really like it's a really unproductive way to think. Yeah, I think then you have so much fear and anxiety about doing it because then you have to do so much and yeah. Yeah, I think that's a really important point. Is that you start small. Yeah, you gotta start small and if you can get one person to get excited the back to visit and like to go out and join you in a pro.  I was like, that's something that's no like that's no joke. Like that's an amazing accomplishment. Actually. I'm getting a couple of people excited about it and you know getting something like five people more politically involved. You know, that that's the start of a movement. Yeah, I think if you can have that perspective a lot of things can change and I think that our community is severely lacking that and I think if we can just shift the way that we think in that way like a lot can happen in a lot can change. Yeah.  Yeah, it's just that's very true. There was an incident here a few months ago. Some guys some articles that were working at gas stations. There's respect to this Black customers. I walked in and eventually like the whole Community kind of like the black community will like upward against them and stuff and be their lack of like sincerity training and lack of Education being educated on this kind of topics. So education is a huge key when it comes to these kind of things right, but I also think that  if like because of like how I guess wait, why don't one of my trying to say is  How these things like these topics affect you yeah kind of goes back to like how active you can be about something like for example, like, you know, I have friends who are like DACA recipients, right? Yeah, you know because of that like all you know, anything else like that doesn't pertain to to the DACA issue like they don't care about me because like, you know, Doc is like a huge thing now, it's like oh also in like they're politically active. I think that's a huge part like for that of community because a lot of these things like don't kind of face them. They're just like here like whatever.  We can't do a lot of change to this country. You know, we're here as immigrants and let's just let you know live by the I think the other thing too is like as a child of immigrants and I think for other immigrants are like our parents when like my parents and they immigrated like all they wanted was to just kind of assimilate to American life, right? And so for them, it was never a thing about, you know sticking out and  Causing like an uproar being like out there. They just wanted to kind of fit in right and so they have this idea of like, you know, there's no need for us to kind of like speak out to make noise and to to make trouble and so I think when they raised us like yes, they tell us, you know stand up for what's right, but, you know, don't cause too much trouble but I think that's now is like we  This privilege, you know being Americans and being young we can make that trouble and so what we kind of just have to be able to combat that sort of old mentality that our parents may have and that and like to be able to kind of make change I guess right? Yeah. Yeah, so going back to education which is really important. How did you start because I see you have the you have the fire you got the emotion like you're doing things and you're doing compared to most  people like myself that that don't how did you start and then what would you advice to someone that wants to put their foot in and get their toes wet? You know, um, I kind of went like I started one. Like I saw I think it was for me was around the time of black lives matter and so a friend of mine actually she texted me and she was like, hey, it's me. Do you want to come out with me and this other friend of ours to go protest and I was like,  like of course, I'd love to because I've been wanting to but I didn't know who else to go with and so my friend and I we she made us signs and three of us carpool together and we went out and protested and it was that high that I got and that like I felt so good because I felt like I made a huge difference even though like, I'm just one person like I felt like I did something right like I actually used my voice and  From there. Like I was like, I can't stop like it was it was it kind of it was just I felt so mm. So it doesn't it just took you to a higher step. Yeah, it literally took my fit like it took my friend texting me and be like, hey, do you want to get a group of us to go? And so just taking that first step I think is the hardest part but once you do it and you feel like you've made a difference or you've used your Vite your voice for good like it's you're never going to stop like you.  Never going to want to stop. Hmm. So I think the biggest piece of advice I would give to anyone is if there's this little piece inside of you that wants, you know to go to a protest or to become politically active like to an extent just take that risk and go for it because you never know what's going to happen afterwards. You never know how you're going to change or how you're going to grow like what impact you're going to make so much you feel and how it's going to make you feel exactly.  So it's all about just taking that risk and going for it. I love the point you made where you said, you know in the probably in the grand scheme of humanity that one protest. Yeah, probably is this is a drop in the ocean. But the same time it made you feel like you were changing everything exactly and that's so important like it's crazy how the smallest thing can change your whole thing. Exactly. Actually. I just want to ask one question you are we she came with us to the Harvard Auto weekend. Yeah. Yeah.  And I don't know if I don't know which electricity that you came with us to but there was a question that someone else asks us like on our last like two episodes ago. The question was do you think it's damn ISM inhibits democracy?  Oh, yeah. Well that question was asked. Were you at that one? I don't know if you are the one.  Because you came on Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was there I was there it was going to be between this guy that was upsetting to a nurse and another got over sending Egypt. Yeah, and that was like the debate around to do you remember what we said? I don't I don't remember it was said by remember being there. Yeah, but you think the islamism inhibits democracy?  Honestly, no, I don't I don't know or like the tough questions. That's a really that's a really tough question. We did not put that one in. Yeah, so curveball like like are you saying it's like kind of extremism is it like about just just like Islam in general modernist know that? No, I don't think it inhibits democracy I think because the  If you were to look up, I feel like on the internet just Islam and you know democracy or a snowman activism or whatever like a bunch of results are going to come up words people being like are different heads or sayings in the put and just saying stand up for what's right like stand up like fight for what's right try to make Society better for all so I guess with that. I don't think it inhibits it but I could be completely wrong. I'm no expert.  We talked about that. Yeah, but a little bit on the pocket I did agree to because I think Islam has like it does entail a political structure. Yeah, and it's one that were people get to elect the people that are making decisions. So I think in that sense, I also am not an expert at all. Why would I would agree as a biased? Yeah. What do you think? What do you think? Oh, man. I I think it does I think to a certain limit  We go. Yeah, it does inhibit. It doesn't have it. Yeah, because  I mean we told Ike you know, there's freedom of religion freedom of expression all these things but I don't think to an extent where includes a lot of reasons other religions and other minorities and stuff and then, you know, especially like during that age I guess who like when a lot of items like partaking like sleeve trees and stuff like that. It was permissible and everything and it was like, you know set like guidance to like, you know slavery is bad. It's horrible. It was like it wasn't like favored but it also  Wasn't like didn't speak is sending to speak out against it. Yeah, so I think that's like a very problematic like especially like in this day of age. Oh, yeah, for sure. So, so can I change my answer and say that I do think you know me to hold on where we are on time. We're at about an hour. Okay will probably ask a couple more questions. Well where we are in the know.  Notes because I'm recording because we like to like sort of round it off with maybe action people can take and steps and we were talking about things people are doing good things. Yeah, and there are organizations and there's resources. You just don't hear about them. Yeah. Do you have no like of anything that we could join or any good resources that you found anything? You can find that the audience could find beneficial. Yeah. Um,  So well because like when I took a look at the nose, I tried to do my own research of stuff that's going on in st. Louis and I looked up just like ways to get involved. Like I literally Googled I think st. Louis activists events or activism and there was this website that came up and I forgot the name of it, unfortunately, but I'm I'm sure I can like find and send it to you guys and it has like a list of things going on like in  Free so it's like they update it frequently to kind of show different events, whether it's just like I don't know like a book club or people I do have a friend from high school who he always like I think it's like the acronym is weak. And I think it's like West County. I forgot the name, but it's like every Saturday they have like a black lives matter vigil and a different spot in West County and I think  and st. Louis, especially, you know having to major universities, there's always stuff going on like you never like don't be afraid if you're not a wash you student or a slew student like don't be afraid to show up to their events or to join their organizations because I can say at bu we like our SJP used to have like people who are 50 or 60 years old shaped or meetings or people from different universities with always come like  I would go to I would go to events at Harvard or MIT and at all the other universities and other University students would show up to ours and it wasn't just a solidarity thing. It was just because they Keno this University had this event. It sounded interesting. I want to go to it. So even if you might not be directly associated with the community, you can always attend and there's no age limit with that. I would say if you've got like high schoolers who listen to the podcast like they should totally show up if they want to learn or if you've got, you know people who are young professionals who graduated?  Be afraid to go back to University like these are hotbeds for activism. So the research you were talking about lists. Yeah things in St. Louis area that are happening. Yeah. Yeah and sure send that. Yeah, I'll definitely send that to you guys. It can be hard to find to find it really can't unfortunately but like I think because silence is a big city. It's got their stuff always happening and it's got a diverse community. So there's just a simple Google search and you can find a lot of  of things going on on Facebook. Yeah. You're so lucky. You got this Google. Yeah. I got you. I'm so lazy. You have any questions Maddie? No, I think that sums it up. Yeah. Well inch'allah in the future moving forward like we can be that platform where if someone's doing something amazing that they can come on heki valdi and we can like blow them up and then they have like millions of viewers and things change and we have this  Let work in this system in this platform in place where we can promote people that are doing these things and yeah can share stories like that like yours I can Inspire somebody and you know, that's the goal moving forward. Honestly, you're definitely going there. I think you're already doing that honestly like this life out of found out about like the podcast. I thought it was so cool because I had never heard of like a podcast like this before honestly, and I think it's  It's it's really exciting. And so yeah, it was surprising for us to we were Googling like okay, we had what's our competition here. Like we're searching was you can't find anything. There isn't good for you, which is good for moving living Market. Yeah, where the market leaders or the where the apple of Autobot cast right now and Maddie Steve Jobs. Literally he wears black turtlenecks all the time. But thank you for coming on. This is good. Thank you so much for having me.  You got a good energy. Now if I feel like I need to go protest right now. I'm starting March and this cold 32 Degree rain right now. But yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for sharing your story and all the amazing things you're doing. I know we didn't like highlight the stuff that you did was graduation much. Although she won in a war like the scholarship or something and for like this make a company. Oh, I don't know. Okay. So, how did beauty is?  Like a really big makeup brand she predict what's on is this iraki? American woman who founded her own Beauty brand which is like super super popular in the Middle East but also like all over the world and she had like a competition for the launch of her new concealer called the overachiever concealer and was just asking about you know people to share why they're an overachiever and I was like, you know what YOLO  I'll keep my shot another shot. I swear I swear usually most but really angry and I just shared my story and she loved it and asked me to join like be a part of the campaign and had me come out to Dubai which is super dope and just be a part of it and to share my story and everything. So yeah, this really dope is really cool. So what are you doing now in UK, so I'm getting my  ders and law at so as University in London, which is a really cool University. And you know, I'm hoping to just utilize my law degree to just change the world one step at a time. So you're not going to law school you getting your message along. Yeah, the difference is I can't practice yet. But I wanted to do this as an opportunity to kind of like live abroad to experience a whole new could like country.  I've never done something like that before and also I was a little like not iffy about studying law, but I wasn't sure if it would be the right fit for me and this opportunity came and solidified my love of the law and like the fact that I want to be a lawyer an attorney. So yeah in sha Allah guys, I hope so if there's one lesson we all learned you keep shoot your shot. I'll keep shooting me Shine That's  Should I swear I keep missing? All right. God bless. Thank you for joining us for episode 7 Arab activism.

So tell me what we gonna make that match tell me what we're trying to take that cab what we're trying to calculate that average and if it aint to innovate - skrappe intrinsically detail embedded in these things land of milk. Hi, everyone. I'm Melissa Dewey and welcome to poets return this week for our very first episode. We're featuring a local Los Angeles poet who discusses the ins and outs of self publishing your work and sharing it on social media which are two huge things a lot of local artists and writers everywhere are looking into doing more of Kate Strauss writes about a multitude of topics ranging from social anxiety and addiction to body image and learning to love our own voice. Her book of poetry is titled - why?  And I was fortunate enough to hear Kate share some of her words in person. All right, we have the lovely Kate Strauss on poets return. He'll okay. Hello. And if that belief, excuse me, oh both are fine. But we always people are was like, what is that? I'm like, yeah. That's my last name. It's weird. So Kate is an amazing poet. She publishes her work on Instagram. She's self-published and she's here today to actually show we're going to share some of her work talk about her process.  And just kind of dive into attacking poetry on not only social media, but just getting out there and sharing your words as yeah, Gary, even if it's one person can be it can be it can be exactly so if you also just for everyone to know I like to get this out of the way, so, it's Kate Strauss poetry. Okay atest are a u.s. Spoe t Ry exactly. Yes. And now how do you say is it - its - why - why? Yes, so every chapter in my  my book is like Hardy like heart - why cheeky like cheek - why shitty shit - why so I didn't actually come up with that my friend came up with it. She was like every one of your chakras is like - why you should just call it - why and nobody gets it people call it like - it's fine. It doesn't bother me at all. It doesn't make any sense. But like hey, you know, it's like when people say Bowie is bougie and like weird that G come from but that's bro. I love that idea. So tell me about how was your friend you said came up with that idea.  Yeah, I love that. Yeah, one other people can kind of almost see objectively things in your work that you would never know. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was a really cool experience for her to come up with that. And now I think for my next book it's going to be like way more straightforward. It's just going to be sobering thoughts but good title good thing. Yeah. Yeah, whenever I publish that which I would like to not self-publish, but you know, it takes a little more effort. I know that's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about because self-publishing is  Thing I've considered and I'm like I said, I'm kind of a chicken about sharing my stuff and how did that whole process like how did you get educated on how to even do that and Hunter have go so I actually finished my poetry book while I was in Italy very romantic and by myself and I was just like hold up in my apartment. I like didn't see as much of Italy as I probably should have and finish my book and then I hired this guy from freelancer.com and yeah freelancer.com  And who is amazing? I was suggesting to anyone. He really liked put together my whole book for me and used illustrator and I got some people to Amos to illustrate things and then would send them over to him and he really put it all together for a really really small amount of money. And then my mom's friend kind is a self-publisher on Amazon. So she just sat me down and she just took me through like step-by-step. This is what you do this how you use create space, which is Amazon platform. This is how you  Have to format specifically for Amazon. And yeah, we just like, you know a lot of Googling, you know, figuring out like how to get an ISBN and you know how to get your barcode and all that good stuff. You know, there is a lot of technical things that go into it and I think that intimidates me to not only the sharing of vulnerability but then it's like the red tape you have to go through it's like yeah, why couldn't I be in the humming my days where I could just wander around I'm drinking then like my heart when it's some publishing has like it's brilliant, right? Exactly and I even went through the thing of like on Amazon.  Amazon wouldn't show my poetry book for a while because it was adult content is it has brass on the cover and it's like considered erotic poetry which is ridiculous because there's not one thing about sex in my book which just proves the sexualization of a woman's body at any. Yeah, you're talking about anything because I talk about breast and we talk about bodies and stomachs and butts and like I do talk about rape, but you know like not in a sexual like why not?  And like yeah, exactly, right. So it was just really interesting like going through that red tape and figuring out how to change how I described my book and you know, when people saw from it So eventually eventually like if you search - why Kate Strauss you can find it on Amazon, but hmm see but that's just that which probably is part of one of the reasons why you don't want to go through self-publishing again, because I'm sure you want to be able to yeah, it's the same reason why when you have a great artistic idea and you want to write a grant it's great and  But then if you get the grant they might make you change everything that you and Sheree wanted the Graham sure. So I'm glad that you were able to maintain obviously most of the Integrity of what you wanted. But having to change even the description can feel intrusive when you're yeah, it was really interesting. It was it was a little it was a little odd. I was really frustrated by Amazon because I have friends who've given this to their this book to their 13-year old daughter's, you know, and like I think it's an important book for 13 year old girls to read lately, you know, I think talking about our bodies and talking about sex in  vaginas and penises and whatever. I think it's really important and I think children should be exposed in a not a sexualized manner but like should be able to understand. I also think like giving them books of this nature like lets them feel like they can ask questions absolutely gives them a safe space that means children are having these thoughts these questions these concern raised experiences sadly at very young ages some. Yeah, and the reason people go through so much trauma without Ever Getting to deal with it is because a lot of the time they don't have a safe exactly.  Gusset so yeah, I think it's awesome. Yeah, I think it's awesome. It's cool. I really love also sharing my poetry in Instagram because people then feel really comfortable to share their poetry with me and I love that. I absolutely love when people share their poetry with me and they feel comfortable saying like, oh I've struggled with this eating disorder stuff or I, you know, just like opens up a line of communication. That's really really special and important to me. It's wanted such a it's a dialogue that so many people are thirsting and hungering for to be able to know that  Nobody else feels this way. Definitely. They're not alone, you know. Yeah, so so well on that note, I'm going to have Kate share. I'm gonna have her share a piece that she wants to first and if you don't mind reader view, yeah sure. I love this poem and I don't care if anyone doesn't like it. I'll be your mistress. I'll be your secret. I'll be the last drop of honey in your class that you lap up quickly with your finger to taste its sweetness while no one is looking because you told them you don't eat sugar anymore.  Damn it Kate. That was that's on your Instagram. That was one of the ones I was gonna write because I love that poem. Yeah, I love it. Come to yeah the description and like you no matter who you are in the well, this is very sweet. Like everyone feel something when they hear those for yes because it's because for me it reminds me of a probable experience just as I'm sure yeah. Hmm. So do you want to talk a little bit about what inspired you to write this sure. I mean, I've been dealing with men since I was young  We you know straight man has I am well, I'm not straight but I date men and I felt for a long time, especially when I came out to LA that and we just talked about this before we started, you know, like people are fickle here. I just I this book a lot - why is a lot about like me not recognizing my worth and I was such a victim for such a long time and I was like, well, you don't recognize my worth. So it's your fault. It's on you. It's like well, I wasn't  Using my words. So like how is somebody else supposed to so this poem is kind of about like it's specifically about like a man using me but I don't even want to say using me because I don't want to put the onus on them like it's that's my choice if I get myself one of those situations, but it's about a man being in my life and not yeah not respecting or like giving me the worth that I deserve but appreciating and appreciating me. Yeah and like taking what they want and then  Starting rest right? But again, I feel I'm not in that victim place that I was when I wrote that poem. I mean, this is really interesting going back and reading the poems from - why because I'm very very different which is a it's a crazy. It's not crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. Yes. Yes Kate and I were just talking about this also before we started that I we both have had relationships and that we've gotten out of and whatnot. But I wrote a book of poetry just all about my last relationship because I was like, I need to just put it somewhere. Yeah and put it all into.  Thing and even now when I go back and read it, I'm like, oh I'm not it's nice to know. I'm not there anymore. It's a great way to journal. I think it is. It's a beautiful way to like see your experience and kind of track how you were feeling. And yeah, I've written it's interesting I especially because I share on Instagram like I really try hard to be respectful of people and to not like my most recent relationship. I don't think I would post any of the Poetry from that quite yet because I just don't think it's very kind well and it's like you don't want to fight you don't wanna get like Taylor Swift  Swift syndrome where you just you know, calling out of your last bruises and bumps. Yeah, exactly. But I think and that's very I think that's a very mature thing as a writer too. And that's something to know that you're not being the victim. It's real like this is about expressing this feeling expressing this experience and hoping that somebody else can read it that might still be there. Yeah. I know. Okay. Maybe I need to assess her anyway father and even know my worse or yeah, but that's a very hard thing to do people. I mean it's loving yourself is not easy.  Mmm, it's not it's not it's not easy, but it's definitely something you have. I'll speak for myself have to work. It's not it doesn't come naturally to me. I mean, my natural state is like Kate you are bad same you are AB your bad girl and not like a cool bad girl, right like like just bad just yeah, so I work really hard on accepting myself and loving myself and and I do that through poetry to you know, like write poems. I'll write love letters to myself and just like that, right?  Things about myself and yeah, it's changed a lot since this I wrote I published two years ago, which is crazy to me. I know years because I feel like even I was talking to Heather about this and I can't believe it's been two years. Yeah telling me. Yeah and self-publishing. Yeah, but that's okay. Yeah. Yeah, really crazy. I need to take that advice about The Love Letters to yourself because that's that sounds like actually really great idea. Okay, there was another there's a one there's one of these that I really yes. Okay. So this poem of Kate's I really like because  several reasons one of which I'm that weird pirate where I love when anyone uses like nautical terminology or like anything but I also love it because as we were speaking about women with their bodies, like respecting our bodies knowing how to treat our bodies how other people treat our bodies like it's a very difficult relationship and it's a tumultuous relationship and like you said, you have to work at it. You have to work at loving your all of ourselves. And so I'm just going to read this starts with the question, which I also love we're meant to  Cherish our bodies I struggle with that the phrase Your Vessel confuses me my vessel.  The one that can't choose which foods it's allergic to the one that breaks out in acne. That's red and swollen that carries more weight than it ought to that swells that stings that knives and glitches.  Sometimes it's a body that lets the Mind hurt it.  Let's people ravaged it destroy it.  My vessel feels like more of a burden and something that carries me.  You know because I feel like that's so that's something that not mean men deal with this to everyone deals in this. It's just carrying the weight of the physical the mental the emotional the past the present the future. It's just like sometimes I always say this to people I go sometimes I feel like I'm just like this big walking dumpster hmm, you know, you're supposed to receive the vessel and I love that term because it's but it's like sometimes I just feel like I've just this accumulation of  garbage at times like realizing know our experiences are what they are and right we're not perfect and rmp actions can be daunting. But yeah, I just I love the questioning to yeah, I feel like that's that conversation that we have with ourselves. Right? It's interesting that you said that I was just I was thinking when he said the nautical thing I could make probably like a collection of poems of nautical stuff because I have an x marks the spot home. I have a like a coral reef part of a poem and I  Starfish poem and I have you never want you out of elements a descriptor. Yeah, how about you use the elements? Very strongly? Yeah are descriptive - because same I'm I got it's to a point now where in Birdbrain I'm like, maybe I need to split these up because like happens poems are like all about the ocean, but I think I don't know about you but there's something for me at least that when I can't describe an emotion like it feels like it's grander than I am. There's something freeing about like going to definitely  Yeah, definitely. I agree too big. Yeah, it's I like I like writing about bodies and my experience with bodies and and you do it very strong. I mean even in your description on Instagram Kate's description writer. I can't stop writing about bodies and mushy stuff, which I absolutely love because I think that that's also a very astute description of I feel like so often we your self-deprecating to like a description of the poet's Journey trying to not take ourselves too seriously, right? Because at that point you're like,  People to be like I'm poet. Let me tell you about the darkness. That is one of the things like I don't like about poetry. Is that or poet or people's perception of poetry is that like you have to be like a drunk who hates themselves and hates the world and it's so not true. You know, I don't drink and I mean I was drinking when I wrote this book, but I don't drink anymore and I haven't for two years and like I might I was so scared when I stopped drinking. I was like, I'm not gonna be able to write I'm not going to be able to  like have things flow like what am I going to do? I wrote so many poems about getting sober and I wrote so much about like all the emotions that came up actually because I stopped drinking as opposed to you're finally feeling right all my life feeling it. Yeah, so there was so there's so much in there and I can like process and like actually, you know, I don't write the same poem seven times over in different ways because that's yeah. So yeah, it's pretty poignant. Yeah, because I'm not  I can like processing's and actually deal with Shedden like, you know finish a story and the right keep starting the same story exactly. We'll take the cows. But you know, this is like Charles Bukowski that's like an issue. I kind of I struggle with him. I love him - I really like him. I struggled with was like a love-hate because I think he liked reminds me of like the bad side of me like the part of me that at the demon that I want to feed, you know, it's like be careful that quote like the careful when casting out your demons you cast out the best thing that's in you which I get but it's also like you don't need to feed this.  Monster, I agree inspired. I agree and that's which is why I also really admire you for getting sober which is amazing to You're Sober that's freaking huge specially in Los Angeles for a treat to talk to some people but ask me that often. They're like, how do you talk to people like well, but it's not and I'm sure it's not that it's gotten easier. But do you feel like you've gotten to a place where just because you're more comfortable with your own? Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't it doesn't bother me at all to just it's really freeing to do a lot of  The things that I thought I couldn't do sober it's freeing to like dance sober. It's freeing to like have deep, you know conversations sober and you remember them and it's really freeing to like do all this stuff like stand up in front of crowds and do stupid things and like think that you could never do those because you had to have a drink and you to do them and you know, you don't have to you don't have to it's really freeing. Yeah. That's powerful. That's very powerful. Well, and I think that that's another thing I've noticed in your poetry is that talking about  Addiction, you know talking about eating disorders addiction the trauma of sexual assault. All of these things are things that so many people deal with and are afraid to put out there. Yeah, because you know, it's the internet you never know. Someone's going to troll you or be just you know, and it's like silly to fear that but it's like that eight-year-old and all of us that's like is someone going to like think I'm stupid or like be sure to me and show I'd it's hard it's hard. So that's one of those things that I think social media can be helpful though because it's a platform to where you're like, I'm just going to get out there. Yeah.  Do you have an another poem that you'd like to sure have her share a couple more poems? I'm slowly learning how to voice my needs are them out but I don't think my needs are a blowing sheet in the breeze hung up after washing. I think my needs are thick old Persian Dusty rugs that need to be hit against a metal fence again, and again, and again until the ground around is Dusty and the rug is worn but clean.  threads bear dust cleared needs met  Yeah, I love that one too. Will you read before you get to the will you actually just read it one more time? Yeah, thank you. I'm slowly learning how to voice my needs are them out but I don't think my needs are blowing sheet in the breeze hung up after washing. I think my needs are thick old Persian Dusty rugs that need to be hit against a metal fence again and again and again until the ground around.  Just Dusty and the rug is worn but clean threads bear dust cleared needs met. I love that too that I think would be a really great poem to visualize. Yeah, it would be cut wood that would be could literally just be someone hanging out and then and I love the idea of the rugs and it's the metal fence to yes crucial. Yeah, because it's like that. It's not a clean sound either. It's messy and it's dusty but  But I love the like threads bear needs met. Hmm. It's interesting because like a lot of times and I talked about this also a lot and a lot of my poems is like that idea of femininity and grease and Womanhood and you know, I am not I would not consider myself. I have a lot of masculine energy and I don't mean like I'm very male. Like I just have a lot of masculine energy is the misconception that people write don't understand. No yin-yang dark white, whatever dark light whatever like  There's in my opinion like too overbearing forces good evil. Whatever it is, like just masculine-feminine. We happen to also sometimes attach those to our sex which I don't think are is correct, but I have a lot of masculine energy. And so sometimes I felt for a long time not very feminine. And and in that I felt that my needs weren't very feminine because I needed more and I wanted more and I it was not a blowing sheet. Like it wasn't like a pretty little like I just  you like a hug and like some love and my girl, you know, I was like no, I need some deep intense emotional intimacy and  I need to be seen and I need to be heard and I'm not always gonna be clean and right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well that's like we associate all these terms with like men like grit and like even stuff like strength and bravery those words even now bring up do no pictures of patriot and yeah, crap like that and yeah, we're getting to a point where it's not so much but I do think especially in the western world. There's this idea where being a woman with a strong masculine energy is seen  As an aggressive or a negative more like you're too much or you're a witch in the professional world. You're a bitch right? And it's really just knowing what you want and being able to ask for it. Hmm. Yeah, I think it's also a great thing in your poetry that I think would be awesome for visualization as I feel like the images are so specific and clear that like the association between a sheep blowing in the wind as opposed to an old dirty Persian.  Drug against a metal fun. Yeah, that's like that's clear. That's just so clear to me. And I think that's one of the things I love about poetry is sometimes it takes so little words. You can say like three things. Yeah. It's like I know exactly what that is. Yeah exactly what that is.  So it's funny because and I don't actually own this book, but I don't know. Do you do you own Milk and Honey by? Yeah. Yeah, so and I love her writing. I think it's and I think that's one of those things where  A couple of years ago I stumbled or whenever she got published shoes. I think published in 2016. Yeah, and I think it was two or three years ago that I stumbled upon her book and Barnes and Noble and was not in a good place and opened it and was reading, you know in her poems. Are there also I think very much about the body and we hands bottom and she talks about these different because milk and honey. If I remember there's chapters that are based on like different struggles kind of like it goes through and at that time I was really working on pick your poison.  It was one of my books and it was going through different chapters of struggles. But her writing had like this lightness in this hope in it. Hmm Beauty. Mmm, it does and instead of at that time I wasn't able to enjoy it. I was like, well, this is good. He's more Darkness like this doesn't know. Yeah, and I rejected it because I was I'm sure jealous and just wasn't prepared to accept. Hope I think also in writing and so I Revisited her work like probably six  weeks ago and I was like, oh this is delightful. This is really touching and love me something and there's so much of a journey that happens in such a short amount of time in those homes, you know, and for me, I was like it made me hopeful because it also kind of like you were just talking about you don't need to be hitting yourself overhead over the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels written like Rick breathing fire to be a puppet. And so it's more and especially like female poets. I feel like the more female poets.  I read I'm like there is this such a bravery in such a perseverance in the female spirit that you get it's almost impossible not to have that hope because it's like at the end of the day you carry on, you know what I mean? Carry on and why not like love yourself and see the beauty of the carrying on instead of just the strongly agree. Yeah. So yeah, and I think reading your poetry too because I feel like even though you have such raw vulnerability there is a hope there is that beauty and there is that light at the end of the tunnel, right? So yeah, the the moral of story is kids you don't  you have to be depressed right? If you don't you really don't you can be happy. It's funny. My dad. My dad also writes poetry and I love his poetry. It's really it's always very sweet. And he once said to me that my poetry was like too angry. Mmm. I like why can't it be happier and I wanted to just like slap him across the face and I did write a poem about that like how my poetry like is an anchor for some people to be able to express their  And feel their feelings, but I did take it a little bit to heart, you know, yeah because his thing was like you're an example for young women or whatever. It was. I think that's what he said and I wanted to be like, but I want to be an example that like you can be vulnerable and in perfect and you know, right about your emotions and have feelings and you're not you're not being overly sensitive or you're not being to like stop acting like such a girl like stop crying like a girl dramatic something so dramatic. I mean, I've been told my whole  Whole life that I'm overdramatic. Yeah, I mean my mom used to call me like melodramatic Kate like that was her name for me. And so like I just my whole life was told like don't be so sensitive. Don't be so sensitive stop crying. And so the Poetry is a great way for me to be able to like work through that stuff and still feel it and show people that like, it's okay, right? It's okay to feel and cry and get angry and you know, as long as like, you know fee I like to say that feelings aren't facts. I don't like that. Yeah.  As long as like you can still take action that that isn't based off of your feelings, you know, you can still take different actions based off your feelings. That's so true. When I think that that's when you you can like we were talking about earlier when you can use it as a journaling tool to kind of be able to look back and go all have so mad. I'm so spiteful I was so jealous or whatever it might be. But again, it's we judge ourselves for these quote-unquote negative emotions, but they're there we all have moments where were jealous. We all need this for work. I'm afraid and being able to express  is that and then go back and not judge ourselves, but just be like, yeah, that's where I was I was legit, but it's it doesn't Define how I proceeded at my life and like obviously you aren't in that place anymore because everything passes and the good and the bad completely. So it's interesting to go back and be like, you know, at least for me when I'm in anger or hurt or fear. My immediate thought is like I'm gonna be in this place forever. Yeah, I'm gonna be here forever. I'm never going to feel this is my life. This is yeah. This is who I am now. I am now an angry person who just like wants to rage on  B and it always passes yeah. Yeah. Well before we jump into another poem yes, when so at what point. How old are you if you remember if it's a specific time or it's just always been something that I know you talked about you your been a writer for a long time. Yeah, but when did you winded poetry kind of did you ever have a moment where you were like this I could actually do this. Like I could actually really express myself in this medium. So I really only actually so I've always wanted  To be a writer but I had a really shitty experience in high school with a teacher and he really broke me and I actually was writing. I'm writing a book like a memoir type book a collection of funny essays called the girl who didn't know anything and in one of the chapters eyes is called the girl who didn't know how to write and I like revisit this can tell the story really quickly. I don't wanna take up too much time. Oh my God, so in high school I had this teacher  Whatever didn't care that I'm saying is name because he was horrible and he was extremely misogynistic and he I would get ill going to his class my friends and I would get physically ill and and what grade were you in high school? I was in 11th grade 10th and 11th, and he told me I wasn't smart enough to take the AP exams. And then I took them the next year and got fives on both. But like that's not the point. The point is that I wrote this really long research paper about depression and you know misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis.  As which I don't actually agree with that anymore, but at that time I thought that was the case then I wrote this whole research paper and he like took me aside after class and was like Kate. This is really good. And I was like, oh I was very surprised at you saying that he was like, I don't believe you wrote. It's too good. It's too good for you to have written and it really broke me and he was like, I'm just gonna give you a see because I can't I can't say you wrote this and yeah, so I went back when I was writing that that chapter in that book in the book that I'm writing. I was like, let me see if I could  Find this essay and I found it. I found the research paper and I started reading it and I just started to bawl because it is the exact same voice that I have today. It is written in the exact same voice. Like I could have written that reason favorite yesterday. It sounds exactly like me and it's totally me so that actually like opened me up and I was like, oh I can be a writer and mr. Crowe eat crow. Yeah, pretty much God. He was a scary man. And and I just want to bring that up because  Cuz I know so many people have like blocks people who are blocks creative locks in their life. And like what I have learned, especially from the artists way. I don't know if you've done it but it's a wonderful book by Julia Cameron. I suggest every single writer does it an artist but she talks about how a lot of people who are like that in our lives. A lot of teachers especially happened to be blocked Traders themselves and they take out their frustration and anger and it's like the Drama teacher that is means to is our like a bleed because she didn't get to be yeah.  Growing up. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, which is a huge but you know, it's a huge problem because that's that can stop someone in their tracks. Yeah, if you hadn't overcome that. Yeah, I hadn't kept going. Who knows if you would he ever and it did stop me for a while. I mean when I was in college, I like would have loved to go to college for something writing-related and I didn't I went for acting and you know, every time I wrote an essay I would second guess myself and I wouldn't think it was good. But anyway, once I read that chapter in that book, I was like, oh my God, and I just started opening up and writing all the time. And so then I started really writing poetry and  I'd always liked dabbled and songwriting and I have like all those like funny songs you wrote in your 14 which are so wonderful and Rich and beautiful and I love them. I love fourteen-year-old. Kate's mind and feel so bad for her so much compassion so much compassion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so I just started writing again and that was like four years ago. Wow. Yeah was like opening three years ago. Yeah was just yeah, I just like non-stop. It's also I  With my boyfriend at that time who had like moved out to Los Angeles with and was like, I'm gonna marry this man and then like, you know didn't obviously right plans true. Yeah things changed and I wrote a lot about that and  that that poetry helped me so much that that break up. I mean so much I still to this day write poems about him because it just yeah, there are those are people that imprint on you. So just they'll always have a spot and I think that's one of the things that always inspires us. It's like a never-ending Fountain of feeling, you know, even if you're moved on from that point in your life, you can remember the potent. Just how potent that feeling was. It's like you can draw from that for ya.  Forever. Yeah, like a well. It's like a wow exactly.  Talking to Kate about this made me think of something.  One of my favorite things about talking to writers is learning what they're writing ultimately does for them as people, of course. It's a way to sort of Monitor self-growth. And in that way a lot of writers will tell me that ultimately writing is extremely therapeutic for them, which it always makes me wonder what do people that aren't writers do for therapy. Of course, there's exercise prayer meditation yoga. Sometimes it's taking care of your pet or having a close friend you go to for counsel.

It's really helpful having someone else to talk to you deserve to be happy and better help.com is the world's largest counseling service and it's a hundred percent online now back to the good stuff. Well, I'm talking about you getting you know changing having the fear of getting sober and being afraid you were going to going to be able to write. Yeah when you did start writing about getting sober. I mean, I'm sure there were so many emotions of in terms of like  Purging just all the stuff that you had dealt with but had like you were saying you dealt with it in little increments, but weren't under presenting with it hundred percent. That's when I really started writing about my breakup and I was like, oh my God, I still miss him. Like I still I still have feelings for him. Like I still love him and you know, I have a poem about how like if you want to always be loved just be one of my ex-boyfriends even for a day, you know, and like I just want to hear that one, you know, that's who I am and like I will always love all of my ex-boyfriends, you know, even if I broke up with  Them just because no I love them. Hey, and that's something my thoughts get all societal here. But the whole society about what I'm just going to ghost this person. I'm yeah, they're dead to me and like to be honest. I'm almost jealous of people that can do that. Yeah, because I'm like, you know, I agree that will never be me. I will always be open to saying yeah, I still have love for that. Yes, and they hurt me. They wronged me they ran me over with the truck. But like yeah, yeah this poem at this this book has a lot about that ex-boyfriend has a lot about this guy.  I was seeing who had cancer like three times and then ghosted me and we'd like been dating for like a year is crazy. So I thought he died. I thought he died. I have a lot of poems about him. And how did you find out that he hadn't died. Can I ask um, I was like just searching obituaries all the time and like wondering if his was going to come up and then months and months later. He appeared at the Grove. I saw him as a hero run into yeah.  He would act like everything is fine. And I was like, oh jeez. Wow. Yeah, not great. Pretty. Hey, it's all good. Material. I'm going to say there's some their shit that I'm like I couldn't make this up if I tried exactly it could not have falsified this information if I want him, there's great. There's great material there and also like pain is the Touchstone of recovery, you know, I think that I think that the only time I really learned and really grown is through painful events. Absolutely and I think people are so afraid to  You were so afraid to feel pain and it it sucks and suffering sucks and struggle socks, but I also think it really does teach you how to be able to join more and more present love yourself because you're like that I could make it. I made it through that bring it on. You can't have Love Without Fear. I mean, this is just going to get super spiritual but there's this great book called conversations with God and by Neil I was going to say diamond, but that's definitely not his name and Neale Donald walsch. I can't remember something like that.  That anyway it's a great great book and he talks about how like you can't have Love Without Fear because if you didn't if you only had love you'd would have nothing to reflect it with you would just be love. It would just be all it would just be everything right. So the utopian model right the never right? We're right exactly. Yeah, I think it is Neale Donald walsch. Yes, you don't kneel down but it's a great book. It's a great book for anyone and I think for writers to because it is him just right.  And even if you don't believe in a higher power swear, you're not spiritual at all. It's just interesting because he just like was homeless and started writing like letters to God and I just say God because it's an easier word than like the universe shorter, right and he started writing letters to God and then like God quote unquote. Sorry writing back. So honestly, it's just him free writing asking questions and just free writing back from God. It's really good. That sounds powerful. Yeah. I got a couple books. I need to get that and that's why I didn't tell you.  You need to do the artists way. I feel like I've heard somebody else told me that I need to I need to do that. So 12-week program thing that just like unlocks you and many many ways. I'm always in need of being unlocked I now so am I so am I close up so quick it's hard not to and speaking of closing up. So when did you decide to go on social media and really it was it right when you self-published or was there a transition? I think I was  Doing it a little bit before I self-published. So my face my Instagram used to be just me. I used to work for lingerie company and I used to just be used to just be me and bras. That was my Instagram for a really long time. So I transition. Yeah, it is so like deleted all of that and I'm just totally restarted and got good feedback and it actually was a little inspiring to be able to self publish after like getting good feedback from social media. So I was like, oh  You know, like people actually like don't think it's shit. So it was encouraging and like I haven't had it bad. Well haven't had like someone not liking my poetry as a bad experience. I have had like weird experiences people like being three men's. Yeah, I was gonna say I bet you that. Yeah, I recently had an old boss be like read my book and he was like any man who reads this will want to sleep with you and be with you and I was like what not the feedback I want to do. Not not the litter.  Boundary. Yeah, but I mean that's the thing is it's like the other side of the point. Sometimes it's almost that you fear success. Yeah sure you're writing to because it's like then it's out there. It's exposed people can ask you anything people can say it means this people can think it's about them. We just seem like yeah also at a place where yeah, not that you don't care but that you're at peace kind of with Rick putting it out there. Yeah, but I do think that that's probably for me as someone who's not there yet. That's a fear for me is that I'm like someone's gonna  Whatever. I'm trying to think about what how I got there how I got because I really don't give a crap anymore about what I post. Like I just I think it will touch one person maybe and then I'm like, okay, that's enough. That's right. Well, that's the thing is that you went on your page, which I also love is that it's poetry and then it's also you doing things like living your life playing music being with family and friends doing pursuing your passion and okay, there was one on here.  This is something that really inspired me. When I and we were talking about this again about saying that these things are okay to do when you're sober and you realize you can do these things without a drink but I love this because I feel like on social media. There's something so liberating when you see someone be a little bit of a kid, you know and be silly or be vulnerable. Even if it's if it's crying or laughing or being like somehow back to that rudimentary phase in life where you're playing. Hmm, and so this  Is a poem on Kate's poetry page that like it cheered me up one day because I was like, oh man, I need to talk to my inner my inner child is alive right now.  Katie wants to dance she wants to eat peas and pasta. She wants to have a tantrum for hours. It's not fair and then cry yourself to a luxurious post drama Napoli to be woken up by a hug of someone carrying her to somewhere comfort.  Where she's wrapped up in swaddling and ready to wake up for the next day full of headstands and cartwheels.  I was like hmm. But I love that because  you're all the objectifying and whatever that happens in social media and guys being creepers and of putting yourself out there and having to deal with there's something so refreshing about taste like stripping it all away and just being like, you know, what makes you happy what makes you want to express and sometimes it just is that inner child that wants to player wants to scream or wants to cry or wants to run ask eat peas and pasta and yeah, that's one of the other things I love about poetry is that it's so simple, it's like such a simple expression of vulnerability and love and  Joy because it's like it's almost like the words that were all thinking like the things that we're all feel like everyone's thinking that about themselves to some degree in some way specifically for them. Right and you know for me that's my grandma's white macaroni that nobody else makes everything that's white macaroni my grandma so but yeah, I just I love that because I think it balances us out to we get thrown so much shit gets thrown at us. It's negative and you process it and you try to keep going  and you persevered to keep going on and that inner child I think is sometimes what's peddling us about a hundred things affect paddling. Like I feel like I owe my eight-year-old self. Sometimes as Dragon my yeah my butt down the road. Yeah. Come on over that. Yeah. I think I mean one of my favorite writing exercises. I've talked a lot about like writing that I do but other than poetry but my favorite writing exercises is I write with my dominant hand. Like I call my younger self Katie weighty.  That's what my cousin's call me. And so it just like brings you back to Childhood. So I like say hi Katie. Ladylike. What do you need today? And I wrote with my non-dominant hand like what I need as a kid. And so I'll be like a hugger. I want to dance or I want ice cream you get this from running order. Yeah, they told me it was just once. Yeah, it's one of my favorite exercises. I bet you've gotten kind of pretty good at writing with your mother. No, I'm still really shit. I can't write with my left hand. Yes.  Left-handed. I feel like I'm especially bad because I have nerve damage in my right hand. So like I'm gonna have to start trying that not actually might be a good exercise for my physical therapy two birds one stone. Yeah, exactly. Love it. Well, I'm going to have you share if you want to I would love to have you share one more poem If you ask one that it can be from your Instagram, it can be from anything find the ones I'm femininity which I am so bad at saying that word but you heard what it's like and see an enemy. Yeah and then in a minute  But I don't know if I can find it. If I can't find it. I'll say something else. Oh, here's the here. Here's more nautical. Yes.  When we meet will you wait to grab my flesh explore Uncharted Territory? You have the map you've had it for a while now have you poured over that map with your compass and red pen to Mark the exes you'll dig up delicately, of course, like, you know that the treasure you're uncovering cannot be recovered and what you take cannot be replaced.  Treasure cannot be recovered. Mmm. I love that. Yeah. Yeah, you should like I could totally see you doing like an element. Yeah elements like because I love I mean I'm totally biased towards the ocean but I also think that the ocean just I love the relationship between the ocean and the Earth like I feel like it's like unrequited love which is something that I've always wanted to like delve into. Yeah, we should just keep trying to come back but at the same time the ocean is like the most destructive element towards  Earth, right anyway, so basically all of my relationships, I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Yeah, I love to read about the ocean to and I trying to find where I have one here. It is really quick. Well, it's kind of about the ocean but yes, here we go the Earth cries in waves and crashes as she remembers what we've done to her. She drowns her sorrows in us. So it's a quick little one about the ocean but I used  To talk to the ocean as a kid too because I had didn't have many friends and I would go into the ocean and I would talk to those. She was my first experience with like higher power or whatever. It was. Like my thing that I would talk to. It's such I mean  I mean I'll get this is a whole different subject but I get real crazy about the ocean because like I believe the ocean is you I am not nerd like if you look at my YouTube my whole search system history, like my guilty pleasures is all about like lost ships. The Devil's Sea like the Bermuda Triangle like and not in a way that's like spookie ookie, but like I'm fascinated because the ocean like has a relationship with certain people just like when I saw no Lana I cried through the whole movie because I was like, I want to be my wanna like  I've ever wanted to have the ocean have like a special relationship. Yeah, but you hear stories about you know ships will get commandeered Peter get overturned in like there was this one girl her family got their chip got capsize or something. She floated through the ocean for like four days before they found her wound. She was like ten but any time in her whole experience is just fascinating. She talks about how like sharks it was weird because the ocean animals would like it was weird. She's like, I don't know if I was hallucinating but like whales would come around and I protect me and like there.  Was never a moment where I ever felt like I was going to sink like the ocean just felt like it had her and there's something about the elements which I love which again bring you back to child's like the childlike trust in the world that I love but I don't know. I think the ocean is very special. So I encourage you to write a whole instead of poems about yeah. I love the ocean to yeah. Well Kate, this has been amazing. Yeah you so much for coming on. Well, I'm sure we'll have you on again and I don't know what number it was in - why but I really want to think of a  for that because that is  Palpable just hearing it.

You're listening to another episode of BJJ psychologist. And I'm your host. Dr. Yasu Pujols. I'm a clinical psychologist and Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. And today is Wednesday, September 17th, 2019. And guess what? I'm talking about running again. Yes, it has been so long since I was a long or I guess middle too long distance runner back in 2019 like back in 2009 to Thousand thirteen I was running like a mad woman did a marathon and a half marathon and just was really training. I wouldn't really training for anything. I was just going on these long runs usually 18 miles 20 miles on the weekend Saturday morning, and then, you know, six to twelve miles throughout the week several of those and  And was I just I just enjoyed running and I wanted to know how how far I could run. I didn't really sign up for anything until I decided like okay, I need to do something. I need to show off my work. So I did the marathon and half marathon both of them with my sister and she whooped my but she just is better Runner than I but I will I will run the whole thing. I'll tell you that so that was really fun.  I think the reason why I stopped running and I picked up Jiu-Jitsu is because I moved away from Austin, Texas. Austin is a beautiful to run around in the valley is hot muggy and there's not very many places to run and it's usually Street and you're trying to avoid getting run over because people aren't used to Runners. So I didn't really have that much of a motivation to continue running. And anyways, I got  Really into Jiu-Jitsu which became my cardio, right? Well now moving to Houston. My sister has a running group funny. She used to run back in the day with me and now she's had this running group since 2016 and I'm super proud of her. So here I am signing up for running again hating it. I absolutely like dreaded the first time and I was complaining the whole time. I also got lost again so I seem to get lost  Every time except this lot these last two times went well. So there's there's I think think like two camps in Jiu-Jitsu is like the first Camp is like if you want to get better Jiu-Jitsu and have more cardio just do more Jiu-Jitsu. Okay, and then the other side of that is you have to cross train and do these other things to improve your Jiu-Jitsu so I've kind of like  Old between the two, you know doing other things supplement Jiu-Jitsu and then just doing Jiu-Jitsu and I feel for me. I think it's personal preference for ass off and I think for me I need the variety in there the kind of external challenges of doing something different every once in a while. We're actually now regularly every week. So running versus just doing Jiu-Jitsu day in day out I think either will  Get you to your end goal, but for me, there's something about running that makes training low pressure. It also forces that part of my brain that says it wants to quit running because it's so monotonous and boring that it's like a meditation so my brain has to settle down and get into the running and usually takes a few minutes to get to that point. But once I reach  No, the runners state of mind I can go forever and it becomes very relaxing and very fun just to kind of like zone out and do the same movement the same jogging movement. So that is something that I had forgotten about and I also run without headphones because I think first of all headphones are really distracting and if someone's coming at me with a bicycle or or whatnot, I can't hear it if I have headphones on so I've been just trying to take in the entire.  Environment as I run along this the Buffalo Bayou park, I think that's where we're at. Just kind of taking in the sights and the sounds and the people running around with me and the dogs dogs are super cute out there. So just to kind of immerse myself in the running environment. I like that. I really like that because I listen to alot of music headphones a lot and this is a time to disconnect except for GPS because sometimes I get lost  So that's kind of the the mindset aspect of running what has running has done for me. So on to physical the physical benefits of running so because running can elevate your heart rate if you push the speed and if you especially if you do intervals, like go faster than slow down the faster and slow down your heart rate adjusts accordingly that aspect of running I  Ink just makes an incredible impact for me and I know for others on the mat. So when you feel tired and you're like expending a lot of cardiovascular energy, man, if you're running you could just blast through that wall like the wall in when you're rolling and you've given it so much and you need to push forward until the round ends or or the Bell.  Things I think running helps you work through that because you have the mindset of pushing through the the suckiness of it. But then the cardiovascular endurance kicks in for me, especially this past Master worlds, like I was hustling at the end like a spending high intensity intervals of guard passing out Soriano pass and like working with people's legs. They're on their back. It's so easy. They're just kids.  Stick up their legs and I'm out here trying to like pass this Gauntlet of legs flying at me and that required so much cardio. I usually don't lie down on the mat after the rounds over but I had gone so hard and because of that hit training hit workouts and the running I just felt like I could go and keep going until the bell rang and and it was after which I lied.  Laid lie down. I put my body in a resting position on the mat. I laid laid down. I laid down I feels right to catch my breath and allow my buddy body to recover because in those moments man, I gave it everything and because my cardio was good enough. I didn't slow down like I kept fighting like a mad dog until the end on both occasions.  And on the the one yes, I won that match and the second one. I got really close just needed a bit different passing strategy, which I have corrected. Thank you very much. But I really attribute the the running and the hit workouts the hit cardio workouts that I've been doing the last several months and that's proof is in the pudding like when you test yourself you could see  Oh what exercises what strategies you know how your training camp has played into your performance? And for me? I'm keeping running on the agenda and I'm keeping cardio interval training on the agenda. I may merge the two for time, you know to kind of be more efficient with my scheduling, but they are Keepers and I definitely recommend getting into a hit workout hit cardio workout if you can especially with a heart  Rate monitor and elevate your heart rate if it's medically safe, right? I'm not I'm not a medical doctor. So but if you can get your heart rate to the same rate or Peak as a when you're rolling like for me that's 180 and the most intense. So if you can kind of replicate what you're doing on the mat through an intense alive spine roll and you can replicate that on a cardio Machine by you know, really how  Sling during those High intervals high heart rate intervals that right. There is a golden nugget. Just going to pass it along. So give it a shot and hit me up. If you have any questions about a hit cardio workouts. I can kind of guide you as best as I can and give you some information on which heart rate monitor I use which I really love Apple watches garmin's they're not precise enough, but this one device that like a chest strap that I use  Mater to moderately affordable and I'll put that below and the show notes so you can have that to reference. All right, as always thank you so much for listening and I'm over on Instagram every day. Watch my life my Jujitsu life. All right, and many many thanks to all of you who listen and until next time.

You're listening to the Overeaters Anonymous mid Peninsula podcast.  Overeaters Anonymous is a fellowship of individuals who through shared experience strength and hope are recovering from compulsive overeating. Our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors and to carry the message of recovery through the 12 steps of OA to those who still suffer.  For more information, please. Visit OA mid peninsula dot-org  Hi everybody. My name is Ashley. I'm a compulsive overeater. I'm so excited to speak today and I hope I bring something new because I know a lot of you have heard me speak many times before but I have to say I'm so excited that I have a 14-year chip. I got it last week's meeting and I've been in program 15 years, but it took me a good year this year and a half to get abstinent. So I always want to  Just start with that hope to bring a message of strength and hope through my experience and life is changed dramatically. I'm so glad we have a newcomer here. Welcome Kim and I'd like to highlight briefly what it was like I'm trying to think of my most extreme food behaviors before coming into this room. So I remember being in my  kind of the highlight of my pain around. This disease of compulsive eating is in my 20s. I know it was Progressive because I didn't eat like normal normal kids in my family. I'm I'm one of Four Sisters for girls and everybody else was a normal weight and could kind of eat their portion and leave the rest. I was always thinking about the next bite and going  Back to whatever it was. It was being served for more. I knew from an early age that there was something different in the way. I approached not just food but many things, you know, how could I how could I fill myself up make me feel better with whatever it may be food. Probably is my number one. So I remember that just attempt the battle around the weight starting really in college and  and and then it was trying to compulsively exercise or Diet to get the weight off and that became kind of my existence where it was all about the counting the calories and calories in and calories burned and it became really an obsession and I remember feeling so out of control with it, you know binge eating after I'd said for sure I wasn't going to eat X today.  You know binging on that particular food and feeling like what is this? This is so much bigger than me. I remember I always had a relationship with my higher power God. I would say I'm a spiritual and religious person. My concept of God Has Changed dramatically as a result of this program where you know higher power and God to me is so personal somebody some some  You know, I could talk to all throughout the day very different in terms of compassion and love than the god of my understanding growing up. But I also remember being out of control with my eating. I remember saying I'm going to stick to this many calories a day and the Crux of it was living back at home with my parents after college where I would eat things that you wouldn't think about eating you.  No muffins. I remember a whole bag of muffins in a Ziploc out of the freezer, you know eating those on the floor like it midnight, you know, just one after the other and they were frozen. I didn't even make, you know, warm them up. I remember studying for nursing prerequisites when I decided to go into that field, and it was the same same time. Probably 21  22 years of age right before I found a way and I struggle with depression and anxiety. I usually run either a little bit depressed or a little anxious sometimes more than others. The seasonal the season has a big effect on that too. So I'm happy to see the sun today.  but I also remember studying for an exam and eating sunflower kernels or sunflower seeds in the shell right out of the huge bag while I was studying and I remember just eating so many that my lips got kind of pickled, you know, just from the sheer salt and and I remember that compulsion was to kind of settle my inside just that feeling of  You know the anything to kind of calm down my nerves my my relationships and my family was kind of chaotic tumultuous. It had it relates to kind of inability or no modelling. So to speak to feel your feelings to speak your truth and to you know, share share your opinions if I shared  Struggle it was immediately stopped with a I want to fix it, you know or like make it go away kind of and I used to be more Blame Fool about that. But now I realize that was just my parents inability to sit with that pain of what their child was going through which I can relate to now, you know, I have such more of a loving and compassionate perspective.  So what I didn't have was an answer to the food problem and I didn't realize it was so much bigger than the food. So I got into OE I went to my first meeting. I saw I heard other people sharing really ridiculous things that they did with food that I did, you know, eating food out of the trash after you, you know, had thrown it away on purpose and buried it. And and I remember this this levity  Lightness about people talking about it and there was laughter and joy and love and acceptance and I had spent my whole life trying to not show people who I was and to hold it all in that that was such a breath of fresh air. I didn't totally understand how the program worked but I saw that it was a different way of living and I wanted that so  the answer to this program is it's really an all of it. It's in the Traditions its in working the steps. It's working with the sponsor. It's being of service and working with others as a sponsor. If you're ready to take this step. It is life-changing where I couldn't think of life outside of this compulsion to to not eat and restrict calories to going totally overboard.  It my life has become so much bigger than that. So.  It's been 14 years and I've gone kind of fast fast forward to the present. I like to share a lot about what my program looks like today what my life looks like today as a result of working the steps and being of service and you know, really learning a different way to live so  So I think I used to come from a place of feeling like I wasn't enough. There was this whole idea of not having enough not being enough not feeling worthy enough for belonging for love acceptance of myself. And today. I really really like myself. I'm I'm proud of my accomplishments and and I work it's not something that has just come.  It's come through a ton of hard work what that looks like today is say something at work goes awry a difficult difficult matter where maybe maybe the third needs to be some repair or I handled myself in a way that I wasn't super proud of, you know working with the sponsor and kind of getting a script for how to handle that where before program it would have been a way.  To kind of hide and not address. The real issue program is taught me the skills to face things head-on where I own my part I can prepare and say hey I'm so sorry about the delivery of that message. I really meant to say x and and I'm sorry the way that I handled myself and those are the tough things that really lead to our growth.  I've got a team today that I supervised with my co supervisor nurse supervisor of 12 nurses super strong personalities, and I'm proud to say that we have a really really cohesive strong team.  Where we share openly what's going on. I think that we've created that that that safety and the relational piece that we can share even when things you know, the team's not happy about something I can hear it. They're not happy with me about something. I did in leadership. I can sit with it and move through it and find out my part and in a way that it doesn't have a lot of self judgement and  And shame. So this is something I can only do through higher, you know through my connection with a higher power. I can have a completely different day. Just if I forget to do my five minutes of prayer and meditation in the morning where I literally every day have to turn my will and my life over to a god of my understanding. So this program works for non-spiritual personal people also,  so, you know in program you can kind of create your own conception of God, whatever that means to you. It's open to all religions and sects and that sort of thing. So anyways, my day looks a lot different if I go off and my own self will trying to run things which really looks like me trying to control people places situations so that I can feel okay. Okay it may  Look, like I'm trying to help you with your struggle, but it's really more about me and me feeling okay and being comfortable. So that one was kind of hard to detect versus a connection with a higher power where I'm going through the day feeling like okay. Okay God, how can I be used today for the gifts that I that I have been given and to kind of just be in that flow of life and  expressing love and early sponsor said people are either looking to receive love or looking to give and that's really where people fall. It's um, I tend to be more comfortable on the giving end then the receiving end which is something I learned about myself and I think that has more to do with with vulnerability and and fear to really be exposed.  So I'm constantly growing in this program. My last year has been a pushing of myself to be more vulnerable and I have to tell you guys that that has yielded so much connection and relationships and how that looks and work is I'll kind of go about my day if somebody asks how I'm doing I show them the real me now. I'm not I'm not exposing over exposing of my  self, you know boundary list, but  you know, I opened myself up for connection and it's been incredible when I come to the when I show up without feeling like I have to have all everything together and you know be the perfect picture of you know nurse supervisor or Mom or or wife and just be real there's so much connection that's available. So I feel more like my relationships are better than ever.  And I didn't have a model for good for good healthy relationships when I was dating my husband now, I remember that. I'm so thankful. I had years of program under my belt because I remember saying I need to find somebody who can own his part and I can own my part and we can work it out together. You know, we're in my family. We didn't know how to forgive. We didn't know how to resolve so  It's been a part of my marriage today is you know, step 10 you look at your part promptly you asked for a men's and you try to do try to do something different take a different action. So program is spilled into my personal life and relationships in such an amazing way that my husband the other day said he  when something when there's a conflict between us he is so motivated to find, you know to find the repair or to look within himself about what part he has because he knows that that's what I'm doing. And I thought wow what a different way to live like that feedback was so powerful to me. It's something that I've cultivated with the help of God and with you all and the support that I've received in here.  Parenting. Oh man, I it what a what a challenge. I've got a six-year-old boy and trying to think about applying program to my parenting parenting is one of like the highest anxiety level things that I have going on in my life right now and I think that comes from not wanting to see somebody struggle, you know not wanting to see somebody have the ups and downs, you know, really wanting  Protect and and care for but then I think then the other side of me says my struggles, you know, is there really what made me who I am, you know along with program. So to try to deprive somebody of that is really not doing them justice. So you guys I still struggle with that knowing you know, is this fear or anxiety or like a mom protection thing, you know?  Oh God, where where is your will versus my will it's all still kind of confusing but I know it gets clearer if I have if I ask God for guidance and Direction it becomes clearer, you know, is this fear or is this a real intuitive thought? Oh, that's such a big big question mark so the other day I had to bring something to my son's teacher about he's  Really rambunctious Keys doesn't he doesn't like rules. He gets it from me. He's super strong willed which I am too and he's bright as could be he doesn't want to sit in the classroom. He's you know fidgety and he's so creative that I'm thinking just the standard school. It's just not seeming like a great fit for him. So I had to put my you know,  My big adult shoes on and talk to the teacher without shame or blame and say hey, this is what I'm expecting. You know what he's experiencing. He wrote a little book that said Gavin's terrible day if you got kicked out of school and and and I thought this is really impacting him. He's so creative and he wrote about it. I was glad that he could express himself, but it's like we're two step where to let my higher power work.  In program, it's a bit of action and surrender if that makes sense. It's it's you preparing practicing for that baseball, you know hit and God kind of pitching the ball It's a combination of the two of those. So the way I came to her was in total vulnerability. I said I tend to run really  Anxious is this as bad as it seems and I found some connection with her. She goes I tend to be really anxious to and I didn't know it was impacting him like this and how can we be more positive reinforcement versus getting in trouble and only through this program only through, you know, having these hard conversations over the last 14 years with the guidance of my sponsor. And can I can I walk through life?  Life like this. I don't want to come from a place of scarcity. I want to come from a wholehearted place. That's something I've learned to I want to live my life wholeheartedly. I don't want to miss any opportunity. I don't want to be so numbed out because of the food or you know shopping or what the next addiction maybe that I don't experience life.  You know, I want to have the full spectrum of emotions.  So I think that's about all I have to share. I don't have any particular topic. Just whatever is kind of on your heart to share and I want to oh one last thing relationships relationships with sponsor sponsees have been the highlight of this program. If you don't have a sponsor or sponsees, you only have to be one step ahead of the sponsee okay to sponsor.  I'm plugging sponsorship because it takes you out of your own stuff of your own anxious spinning mind to how can I be of service in love? And that's just been such a rewarding such a rewarding relationship piece.  And thank you for just all your smiling faces and head bobbing around the room. I just feel so connected in a part of a part of you all and I like to bring that to every aspect of my life where I can be real and not present a false self because my tolerance for anything less has gotten smaller. I was in a Bible study small group and I thought why are we shooting each other?  Other you know, like let's let's just be real and authentic and not pretend like we've got it all together because nobody does we're all working through something. I don't have all the answers. I still have some things that I struggle with, but I have a lot of joy and connection and  That's all I want to share. It's great.

Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13 today. We're covering the execution of Catherine Howard Queen of England. Let's go back to London on the morning of February 13th 1542 the day before Valentine's Day.  Catherine Howard's Alabaster skin was even paler than usual as she was led from inside. The Tower of London to Tower green a small secluded patch of grass used for the execution of nobles away from the prying eyes of commoners and Spectators. She was terrified and week it took two guards to lead her up a small scaffold onto the  I'm where the Executioner awaited as the charges against her were read aloud the guards held Catherine up by her elbows, but then Katherine collected herself instead of pleading or crying. She stated that she desired all Christian people to take regard unto her worthy and just punishment she stepped away from the guards supporting hands then.  She knelt calmly almost elegantly and placed her neck on The Chopping Block. She was poised and dignified. In fact, she'd practiced for this moment the night before while locked in the Tower of London. She had requested a model of the chopping block that would be used. She wanted to learn how best to place herself upon it but no amount of poise could stop the inevitable.  With one Fell Swoop the Executioner brought down his axe Catherine Howard the former Queen of England and wife of Henry the 8th was dead.  It was an untimely passing Catherine's exact age has never been confirmed. But by most accounts she was still a teenager in 1542 Charming beautiful and full of life. Unfortunately, when it came to matters of infidelity, no amount of charm or beauty could save a woman from the capricious vengeful Wrath of Henry the eighth. In fact one of Henry's previous.  It was the infamous and Belen had been beheaded after facing similar accusations King Henry the 8th was not one to take sexual dalliances lightly. In other people. Anyway, even dalliances that took place before he was in the picture Henry the 8th was an insecure egomaniac almost 30 years older than Kathryn and despite his numerous wives Mistresses and  and extramarital Affairs the fact that his new wife had engaged in relationships with other men before her marriage to Henry triggered the Kings deadly vindictive temper. He banished Katherine to a monastery and immediately set about convincing Parliament to retroactively pass a law convicting her of adultery and treason as soon as the legislation was passed. He rounded up the men.  Redhead allegedly slept with and forced them to admit their deeds next he had one of the men decapitated the other wasn't so lucky.  Before a jeering crowd. He was hanged castrated disemboweled beheaded and quartered. Then the heads of both Catherine's former lovers were placed on spikes and displayed prominently on London Bridge on February 10th, 1542 officials arrived at the monastery where Katherine was cloistered. They collected the young Queen placed her.  On a barge and sail down the Thames toward the Tower of London as they floated past London Bridge Catherine looked up to see the rotting heads of her former lovers three days later. Katherine was dead.  Coming up The Misfortune and jealousy that led to the death of a queen now back to the story.  On February 13th, 1542 Catherine Howard the Queen of England and wife of King Henry. The eighth was executed for adultery Catherine was Henry the eighth's fifth wife at the time. They married she may have been as young as 16 and was most certainly a lively pretty well liked courtier. He was in his 50s obese sickly and covered in pus-filled boils.  Balls plus he'd had two of his previous wives killed. It wasn't an ideal match, but who after all could refuse the king. He wanted Catherine at least until he found out about the freedom of her early years.  Though Catherine was of noble birth. She was brought up in rather peculiar circumstances. She lived away from her mother and father at chess worth house a large estate that functioned more like a boarding house for Noble children a place for their parents to send them until they became adults or got married in a sense. It was a lot like summer camp there was little to no discipline and the boys and girls were known to spend time in each other.  Quarters doing what teenagers do Catherine received little in the way of education at Chaz worth but her beauty energy and spirit made people take notice, especially men. Unfortunately Catherine's first sexual experience was not consensual around age 12 or 13. She was molested by her music teacher two years later. She allegedly began a consensual sex.  Dual relationship with Francis dereham a young man who also lived at chess worth house their relationship continued until Catherine's former music teacher sent the teenagers caretaker an anonymous letter informing her of the affair. Katherine's Behavior wasn't particularly scandalous or uncommon especially among Nobles. It's almost certain that her former teacher was simply jealous Petty and vindictive.  But there were consequences a short time later Catherine moved to a different house where the story goes. She began a sexual relationship with Thomas Culpepper though. It was brief. They proclaimed their love for one another and parted on good terms when Catherine was called to court Anne of Cleves the fourth wife of King Henry the eighth wanted the pretty girl to join her retinue but quickly  Lee King Henry the 8th also took notice of Catherine Howard.  He began showering her with extravagant clothes and jewelry and despite his rapidly deteriorating health and their significant age Gap. He began to court her though. He was still married to Anne of Cleves Henry the 8th wasn't one to let a marriage stand in his way. He had his current Union annulled gave an a big estate and a respectable allowance and then took  As his new wife still despite an inauspicious beginning for a short time. Their marriage was a happy one Catherine proved a capable popular Queen and her Youth and vigor boosted the Kings spirits and health, but then her luck ran out after learning of her previous relationships King Henry forced Parliament to pass a law stating that  And unchaste woman marrying the king should be guilty of high treason. The proposed law also stated that any woman who presumed to marry the king without admitting. She had been unchaste would be put to death. The Act was passed on January 16th. 1542 Catherine Howard was convicted retroactively when offered the chance she didn't even bother to defend.  Self before Parliament she knew she'd never convince the King's Men to turn against their Master. She did however make one effort to save herself when Catherine was arrested at Hampton Court Palace before she was exiled to the monastery. She broke free of the Kings guards and ran down the hall toward the doors of the chapel where she believed Henry was praying there. She screamed in vain at the  the top of her lungs until she was seized Once More by the guards today Legend has it that her ghost can still be seen running and screaming down that very same hallway.

I would like to introduce Ginger and you are our guest speaker for today. You will share your experience strength and hope with 15 minutes. Would you like a five-minute warning at too much? I would like five five and five okay to do that. Okay, I'll stop all yours. Hey everybody. My name is ginger. I'm a compulsive eater. I'm really happy to be here. Hi Ginger. So let's see what it was like so  My story it always amazes me when we get together because our stories are so similar. You almost feel like you know me you got me but yet there's always these little nuances that make us unique and it's one of the things I love about the program is the feeling that no matter who walks through that door. It doesn't matter male female age.  Race, whatever I get you and you get me and there's a great camaraderie in that great feeling in that. But anyway, my story is I grew up in the South. I was born and raised deep as bad as far deep as you can go in the South without going to Mexico. I grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, and I was adopted into a family at Birth so  I didn't know my birth family that I knew I had this adopted family and they raised me as their own they told me always that I was adopted. So I always knew that.  And we were you know, pretty stereotypical Southern family in that there was a lot of food everything revolved around food.  It's amazing. When you go down there, it's all about food and it's almost like you you know, how well you can actually cook is is sort of a class all of its own I mean  It's just very strange place. But and we fry the heck out of everything like you hear those. You know, those stories is for Real y'all it's not made-up. We fry the heck out of everything. So yeah, that's the that's the family I grew up in. I mean we literally were that family sitting out on the back porch playing guitars and singing songs that were like, what the heck does that even mean?  I could go off on that but I won't but yeah, that was our world. That was the world I grew up in and because I was adopted the it turns out it's a long story, but I don't want to take up that much time. But my adoption was it would be consistent open adoption today. And so my my adopted mother lived in fear that one day my birth mother was going to pull up in front of the  House and take me and off. We were achieved never see me again. So I grew up in this fear. That was really supportive kind of suffocating and wouldn't you know it I'm wired to have sort of an adventurous spirit. I kind of like to explore and wander off and and it's all very it was all very Innocent, but I have crazy horrendous stories about  my mother and how she panicked and and I was wasn't allowed to do a lot of things that would be considered common like go to camp or stay overnight places or  you know be a part of a club or something like that. So I was pretty smothered as a kid. And then the other thing that is unique about my childhood is that I actually was in a very abusive home and it's very it's to me it's so confusing and that  when I talk about my parents, they are these wonderful people that you would like, but at the same time there was this incredible abuse happening with my adopted father and then there was this passive thing that was happening with my adopted mother were she just  didn't really do anything to stop it or to take take any steps towards asking questions or anything like that. It was just the way it was and those are things that of course I've had to deal with as a compulsive eater as as and as I become an adult  So I think that kind of thank you. Okay, perfect that takes care of like kind of where it gives you an idea some kind of point of reference of where I kind of got started with food.  And then to kind of fast forward as to what it looked like like, how did I get into this program? Let's go there. I heard about Overeaters Anonymous as an adult and my first response was probably like a lot of people's response and that I was like no way on Earth. Is that ever going to be something I ever join? I thought it sounded very extreme. Very controlling.  I to give up, you know certain foods like never ever have them again. I was like no way I'm never doing that. And so I was on this journey to find just the right program. I just was like if I just keep at it at some point I'm going to land on program and it's going to work for me and one of the things that I important thing that I left out about my childhood is that my mother was extremely obese like  Like, you know like TV show obese like over 500 pounds most of my life. And so I always thought I'm never I'm never giving up. I'm just going to keep at it. You know, she kind of gave up. I'm just going to keep at it and eventually I'm going to land on something but as you all know, I tried a bazillion things. I've got all kinds of crazy stories as as many of you here probably do as well.  This was the last house on the Block for me. I wandered into an OA meeting. I did I actually am doing the hell program. I didn't know there was a difference. I didn't know there was multiple OA programs. I was very ignorant. I didn't really even know what a 12-step program really was and I wandered into an OA meeting and I was lost man. I was discouraged depressed. I felt hopeless  and I kept going to different meetings. I went to about four meetings before I found a sponsor that meeting happened to be a how meeting so I got a how sponsor and I ended up getting my abstinence which of course I hated vegetables. I didn't get you know over 300 pounds with by eating vegetables. So I told my sponsor well, I don't like vegetables and if you know anything about how program  You eat a lot of vegetables, right? And so so I only liked one vegetable. It was green beans. I that the whole week nothing but green beans the entire week and it's like I did it but I didn't think I could make it. I really didn't think I'd make it a day and I made it a week and that was like are you kidding me? I made a week and so my sponsor said, you know, that's wonderful. You know, she was very proud of me and I'm very  Supportive and she said how about we try another vegetable it so I was like well, okay, you know, I'm getting kind of tired of this one vegetable. Maybe we could try another vegetable so that and then I ended up making it a month you guys on never binging eating my weighed and measured meals three meals a day. No one between snacks just doing that and I could not believe it after a month that I was actually.  Abstinent for one month it was the first time I think of my entire life I've ever done any kind of a program and actually was true to it.  And I thought if I can do this a month, I think I could probably do this for a long time. I didn't want to say the rest of my life because that just seemed way too big but I went on a quest and started discovering new vegetables and I started I didn't even know what some of them look like. I found them on the internet. I'm like, okay, I need an image of that and I had I got to know the guy the produce section at the store. Like hey, I'm going to try this vegetable. Can you show me where?  Is I didn't know if it was a route. I didn't know if it was spring winter. I didn't know so it was all very exciting. I lost a bunch of weight a bunch of weight. I wasn't at my goal weight, but I lost a ton of weight like 75 pounds. I was looking really good feeling really good and I lost my abstinence with through some really difficult things in my life and during the stress of all that I turned to food.  So I kind of fired my sponsor quit going to meetings and I was out of program for over a year.  And guess what happened? I gained all the weight back plus up and was pretty miserable pretty miserable it one of the hardest things I ever did was pick up the phone and called my sponsors. I want to come back and right on the heels of that would be walking back into the rooms after everybody had seen me several size smaller to come back in and go. Yeah, this is this would be me.  Sitting here in my Plum self that was pretty tough to do. But guess what? I found everybody was completely willing to wrap their arms around me pull me and close it feel so genuine. So so good and so free to be able to come back in the rooms and have that experience and it was something that I determined then that I was going to give  Back as I move through the program abstinence was difficult. I really had I really struggled the second time around to find my absence again the first time around it felt like it just was so exciting and it came so easily but the second time around was like trying to walk through life with concrete around your ankles. It just was hard and I finally started getting  Some relief, I think when I stopped looking at what I was giving up because I began to realize man. I'm really grieving what I'm not going to have anymore and when I turned finally turned my gaze from kind of like looking backwards to looking for words like this is what I'm going to get. I'm going to get peace of mind. I'm going to get my confidence back going to have that feeling of freedom. And for those who have three more minutes okay for  Those who have continued abstinence. There's nothing better than laying down at night and saying to myself and I rocked it today. There was some difficult things that happen today, but but it really happened. I did it and I feel so good about that.  So what it looks like today is I 3 waited measure meals a day. I talked to my sponsor every day Monday through Friday. We do questions. We've gone through a lot of all the 12 Steps together. Now, I moved onto daily readers and I do that now, I've been through the steps twice now. I have three sponsees that I sponsor and for me, that's a huge part of my  Program my sponsor, you know, one of the things I love about this program is that it's not there's no hierarchy in this program. It's a very linear program. So we're all at the same level. It doesn't matter how much abstinence you have or how many years in the program. It's just very linear. And so it's a beautiful thing when you have sponsees and I just do it kind of a pitch for that because I'm learning from them.  And they're learning from me. Of course. That's the whole point of it. But there's lots of things that I learn about program from them and I let them know that hey that was really helped me. I appreciate you sharing that with me and it could be a recipe or it could be just some kind of aha moment that they had in program, but it really benefits my program quite a bit and I appreciate them dearly I right Monday through Friday.  I do a tenth step every day. So at the end of the day for me what that looks like is I write out all the positives and all the negatives that happened during the day.  And then if there's anything on that negative column that bubbles up to the surface where it's like, oh that really bugged me today. Then I just answer three three simple little questions. What was it? It's not. It's not a book. It's like two or three sentences. What was it? How did it affect me? And what can I do about it? And the what can I do about it portion of this? So  Monumental for me because as you already know, I lived my childhood as a victim now to be an adult. I've realized by going through the fourth step that I still look at myself as a victim and I don't have to be a victim anymore. I'm actually an adult I get to make choices. I'm not a victim of my circumstances. I could change my circumstances, but I don't naturally gravitate to those thoughts. So as  The question what can I do about it enables me to put sort of like the action plan in place where I can go. Okay. What am I going to do about this? Do I need to talk to somebody do I need to change my circumstance? Do I need to  whatever whatever that is, and I see that I need to wrap this up. So that's that's something that really helps me and I just want to say I'm so grateful to be here. I really appreciate the opportunity to give service and if there's any money that I can talk to you afterwards, I'd love to do that. So, thank you guys.
Today is Friday, September 6th, 2019 on this day in 2006. 51 year-old. Susan kuhnhausen was forced to do the unthinkable. She killed a man in self-defense. However, it wasn't a would-be thief or potential rapist that she killed instead. It was a hit man sent by her.  own husband  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original every day. We tell a timely story from True Crime history then analyze the historical impact of that day's events. I'm Vanessa Richardson today. I'm diving into the harrowing story of Susan kuhnhausen. Now known as Susan Walters when her divorce grew acrimonious her medical training saved her life in the least.  Acted way due to the graphic nature of today's crimes listener discretion is advised. We advise Extreme Caution for children under 13. Let's go back to the night of September 6th 2006 as Susan was about to leave work in Portland, Oregon.  It had been a long and arduous Wednesday at the Providence Portland Medical Center though for Susan kuhnhausen a nurse of 30 years every day in the hospital emergency room was long and arduous work wasn't the only stressful part of her life. Susan had recently kicked out her husband Michael and told him that she intended to file for divorce. She decided to go to the salon after work for a little pick-me-up new.  Look new Susan New Life. Once she finished with her hair stylist Susan finally made her way home. It was a little after 6:30 p.m. When she pulled into the driveway and made her way to the door of her house. Susan was exhausted and ready to fall onto the couch and watch a little television before going to bed. Tomorrow was going to be another long shift time to shut the brain off.  But when she entered the house Susan immediately felt something was amiss it quickly dawned on her. It was too dark. She recalled leaving the curtains open before she left for work. Why were they closed now? Perhaps Michael her soon-to-be ex-husband stop by and close them Susan Shrugged it off, but no sooner had she come to this conclusion when something suddenly caught the corner of  Her eye she turned and screamed out of the darkness came an imposing figure. He was a strange man close to six feet tall with a long beard and long unkempt hair. She instantly registered that he was wearing yellow dishwashing gloves and carrying a red and black hammer. This wasn't a robbery she knew right away that this man was here for one thing, too.  To kill her within seconds of spotting her assassin Susan felt a sharp hard pain explode across her left temple as the hammer made contact, then she felt it again. And again Terror ran through her as the hammer continued to fall, but she didn't want to die. Not now not today. This was not the end of her story.  Mustering all the strength. She had left in her Susan managed to overpower the long-haired assassin and rustled the hammer out of his hand. She slammed the cloth side of the hammer into his head sending him to the ground. Then she pounced on top of him and continued to whack him three four more times who sent you here. She screamed who sent you here.  Blood splattered across the floor and wall who sent you here miraculously the Assassin managed to knock the hammer out of Susan's hand when she lost her only weapon Susan instinctively wrapped her hands around the Assassins throat as a nurse in Portland. She was educated in self-defense a precaution when dealing with drug addicts or those suffering from mental illness. She never thought  You would have to put these skills into action. She was trained to save lives not take them, but she also wasn't going to let this man take hers. Susan didn't loosen her grip. She knew that if she did if she gave this man an ounce of the chance that he would take advantage and kill her instead. She tightened her hold watched as his face turned blue.  You're strong. He said as the life escaped him spittle flung from her mouth. Her knuckles were bright red tears had formed in her eyes. It was almost over she thought just a little bit more the Assassins body went limp and his breathing stopped Susan's own breathing slow down as the adrenaline coursing through her veins subside.  She wiped the spit from her mouth and winced in pain from a cut on her lip with her heartbeat back to normal and her hands no longer shaking. She finally looked down at the man below her. It was then that the horrifying realization had struck. She had just killed another human being.  Up next we'll explore exactly how Susan found herself fighting for her life now back to the story.  On September 6th 2006 Portland nurse Susan kuhnhausen was put into a horrifying life-or-death situation and survived after strangling her would-be assassin Susan ran to her neighbor's house and had the neighbor called 9-1-1 when the police arrived. She was taken to the hospital to have her injuries examined and her Cuts cleaned while Susan was being tended to by some of  Same doctors. She called co-workers the police began their investigation the man who attacked and attempted to kill Susan was a drug addict named Edward haffey at the start of their investigation the police believed that he was attempting to rob her. However, according to Susan the day after her attack. She and her friend returned to her home to collect some items to take with her as she went into protective custody.  When her friend was down in the basement, she discovered a strange looking backpack that didn't belong to either Susan or Michael inside the backpack. They found a pay stub belonging to Edward haffey and a calendar with Michael's cell phone number and a note that said call Mike it became obvious that there was some sort of link between Susan's assassin and her husband the police finally acknowledged.  Incident might not have been a botched robbery but a coordinated hit.  Now they just had to figure out why Susan's former husband would try to have her killed Susan and Michael had married in December of 1988 17 years before the attack. Michael was a Vietnam war vet who worked at an adult video store in the 80s Susan fell head over heels for the soft-spoken man believing that she got a good deal on a used car. However record  Show that he was a switchboard operator there and Susan increasingly had doubts that he saw any action whatever the actual causes from. Michael's mental illness Susan did her best to help him as he struggled but after 17 years of trying to help the man she loved and Michael's constant refusal to seek help Susan had enough. She kicked Michael out of their house and told him that she was going to  file for divorce in the days and months that followed Michael started stealing money from Susan who had been the primary provider in the marriage. Michael had recently lost his job at the adult video store, but had kept in touch with a former coworker Edward haffey now unemployed as well half he was desperate to make a quick Buck. He wasn't a stranger to committing crimes either police records showed that he had a rap sheet date.  Back to the mid 80s including arranging the murder of an ex-girlfriend in 1991 and he was a crack addict to Michael half. He seemed like the perfect person to commit the murder have they agreed to do it for $50,000 though. Michael wasn't named the beneficiary of Susan's life-insurance policy. He was still listed on there already paid off $300,000.  House if Susan were to die he would inherit it when Michael heard about the botched hit he left a suicide note and fled after a week on the Run. He was arrested at Kaiser Sunnyside Medical Center in Clackamas, Oregon. He ultimately pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit aggravated murder while in court Michael apologized to Susan. He said I've  Heard a lot of people over the last year and I'm sorry. That's all I can say. I'm sorry in response Susan burst into laughter followed by Tears. Michael was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2008. Susan sued Michael for 1 million dollars and one she wanted to make sure that if Michael got out of prison, he would not have enough money to hire another hit man.  To Susan's relief Michael never got the chance in June of 2014 Michael died of prostate cancer at the Snake River Correctional Institution in Ontario, Oregon just a few months before his scheduled September release when she heard that her ex-husband had died Susan felt no sadness over the death itself instead. She felt sadness over the potential that she and Michael could have had.  Together had he been able to work on his demons.  In the years since that fatal day in September 2006 Susan kuhnhausen now Susan Walters has dedicated her life to raising awareness for Crime Victims. She states that during the trial she felt well supported by police and the Department of Justice. However, once Michael was convicted that support seemed to disappear and she didn't want that sense of Abandonment to fall onto others.  Susan believes that the worst part about the entire ordeal wasn't that her husband hired someone to murder her but that she was forced to kill as she said herself. I didn't choose my attackers death. I choose my life.  Thanks for listening to today in True Crime. I'm Vanessa Richardson today and True Crime is a par Castor original.

I hope you all had a fantastic weekend full of fun and Christmas festivities and that you still have the Warm Glow of it all tucked away somewhere in your heart as for me. I was happy to finish out the last weekend of shows for Christmas Wonderland 2019. Although it's always a little Bittersweet when something that you've worked on for so long comes to a close. You have to say goodbye to familiar face.  At least till after the holidays.  With so much still to do before my family comes spilling through the front door to celebrate Jesus birthday together for just a few days staying busy will be on my agenda for the next week.  But even as I talk about being busy, I'm reminded of a quote by Poet Mary Oliver who says the most regretful people on Earth are those who felt the call to creative work who felt their own creative power restive and Uprising and gave to it. Neither power nor time.  Even in the midst of the busiest season of the year for my family. I don't want to ignore the call to be creative to create something beautiful and meaningful for not only my own satisfaction and joy, but for that of my family and my friends  busyness really is the enemy of creativity for the creative soul to flourish and produce the completed work time must be plucked out of the river of busyness that Russia's all of us along and Carries away all of our inspiration and ideas distraction, especially of the news of the day variety is always going to be there.  But to really seek out inspiration for creativity. We need to discipline ourselves to resist the urge to pick up the phone open the laptop or click that remote. This is the hardest discipline of all to the Restless soul of a creative who feels the pulling of the Eternal.  Being creative in this season may sound impossible when we're busy Crossing items off of lists and spending more time in shops and grocery stores than in our own homes, but being creative doesn't have to look like making something it can be through writing a note or a car to someone who isn't expecting to hear from you.  It can be through paying for the coffee orders of the car behind you in the Drive-Thru.  It can be through taking a tin of freshly baked cookies to that elderly or housebound neighbor creativity of the heart is the kind that I'm referring to here. And as Mary said in her quote the most regretful people are those who felt the call to create and gave it neither power nor time.  I'm encouraging myself and also you to give power to that creative call even amongst the busyness of the Season. Let's not end this year or start the next with any regrets from missed opportunities to bless and encourage someone through any creative means  I hope you enjoy the rest of your Monday and that you give into that tug at your heart to be creative tonight in whatever form that may take.  That's all for me for now. I'll catch you tomorrow. Hey friends Rhonda here again. Just wanted to get you excited about what's ahead for Christmas week? Here's a teaser. I will be reading excerpts from some favorite and familiar Christmas books to get you and me in that holiday spirit and ready for a week of festivities. Stay tuned starting.  December 23rd and going through Friday December 27th and see if you hear one of your favorite Christmas stories read right here on row motivation. I'm pretty excited. See you then.
Welcome to the Chinese.  Hi, welcome back to the Chinese medicine podcast. It's my pleasure today to interview Glenn Bowman. We've got some really great stuff to talk about when we talk about life purpose finding your purpose and particularly the character length. I'm very Hopkinson and welcome to the Chinese medicine podcast today. I'm interviewing Glenn Bowman and he's got special interest in linguistics and understanding Chinese medicine and actually Glenn is a student and that's how I got to know.  And I've heard him talk about this topic before it was so intriguing to be and I think when you've got time, you've got to come and talk about this on the podcast because there's lots of people listening that I'm sure you're going to get something out of this and I really want to hear it a second time around and I'm we want to talk talk in more detail the first time around only heard it maybe 10 minutes. We had a minute time frame to do a talk and then we've got a lot more time now to get into the topic and we're going to talk about Ling which is purpose. Am I not pretty enough? Yeah. It's a  First of all, it's a character from an ancient Chinese character. That means essentially spiritual or a spiritual Essence but also one's own sort of spiritual Essence and then that in a sense can be tied into one's purpose. Awesome. Awesome. Well before we get into that, so I'm super excited about about the topic. I'm going to ask you a little bit about how you got into Chinese medicine how because you're studying Chinese medicine now, right? Yes, how many years into what are you so I'm in third year now.  Well, congratulations invited. Yeah, honestly, yeah. Okay. And so what made you want to study Chinese medicine? Well, it was a very long and winding path that actually led me to Chinese medicine after finishing High School. I sort of had a rejection of all forms of formal study. So I sort of I believe that I would never go to a university or anything like that just because of my own  yes experiences with high school and things like that. So I didn't really want anything to do with it. And when I was 17 a left traveling and I basically traveled and lived around the world in different places for the next nine years or so at some point along the way.  well, actually it can be said that as I was traveling and sort of to begin with it was to experience a world and sort of external experiences and events and traveling in strange places, but then it progressively became more and more an internal Journey for me and I became very interested in the I guess you could say spiritual or mystical or even magical side of life and existence and I was like  Fortunately enough to certain experiences along the way which really opened my mind to these types of things. And then as that progressed when I was living in South America, I had an interest in the Indigenous Medical Systems of South America and a very influential person in my life who works in that field recommend that I actually studied Chinese medicine.  And at the beginning of I couldn't really understand why I didn't know anything about Chinese medicine had never experienced anything to Chinese medicine, but then I intuitively decided to come home and study it and it was when I came home and I was in that first sort of foundations of Chinese medicine class that my jaw dropped and I realize this is almost like a customized career path for me. So I was very fortunate. So you've never had acupuncture before you started it nothing and  Is particularly Chinese hurts or nothing and do nothing about it because that's how I did it as well. Oh my God, I didn't know I didn't have an 11 year Journey Lego discover. I just went straight from high school to that's what but I also had that aha moment in that first lecture going. This is exactly what I want is exactly what I want to do. Exactly. Yeah, so that's great. And so yeah, the the universe or whatever has led you yeah. Yeah.  Yes, I would I feel so and maybe that's what we're going to talk about today. How did you get how do you how do you get to that? Well, like you said that's what we're gonna yeah, I think because I think it actually ties in perfectly with what we I guess going to talk about and as I see it this character Ling and what I was presenting in that speech in a class and this is also why I have such particular interest because I've been through my own sort of  Confusion as to my who I am what my purpose is in life. What is if any might my life purpose and I think also just sorta interested it but it's something that our culture in a western sets like the English language doesn't Encompass these understanding life like I'm getting excited about we talk about today, but it doesn't Encompass that understanding of where as you can when you unpack the Chinese language you can see that  It's embedded into the language to discover something like that. Right? Absolutely. Let's get into it. Okay, so so where do we begin? So talk about the character? First of all, yeah. Let's say that so well, this is my quite I apologize to all the great look he's look at various Chinese. It's it's like a font like times Roman for so this is Lee. And so basically Chinese works as  Like a language of copies of of compounding Yankee different table is today different symbols. And so at the top here we have you which is means rain and in the middle we have coal which means a mouth or an opening and then at the bottom we have wool which signifies dancing shamans and specifically female shamans. So if we this is the character for Ling and this means little inj we'll put that at the bottom. That's it.  You can understand. This is a very ancient character and it's in there's a great dictionary of classical Chinese dictionary medieval Chinese by Paul Kroll and he defines this word as numinous sacred spiritual power or efficacy life principle vital principle embodied realization of the numinous ones in a spirit. So essentially you could consider it as signifying inherent.  Jake intrinsic to life the inner mysterious and ultimately ineffable nature of all things spiritual nourishment and sustenance provided by heaven. And actually this might be a good opportunity to explain why it's a bit we can think of this as a symbol. So here we have rain and it's raining down into these open-mouthed and we have the Shaman's at the bottom. So what this essentially and I'm no sinologist but a symbol is a symbol so  So in one way, we can just extract the meaning for our own so and so what I get out of this is that you have these female shamans who female also signifies receptivity so and they're dancing. So it's a creative act which is this born from the shaman and the shamans role throughout history has been to provide these sort of creative acts whether it be through dancing or singing or music in these things and yet it's with a sense of  Tivity and producing this creative act which is causing the rain to fall into these open mouths. And so that what the through this creativity they're bringing sustenance from heaven heaven. I've spoken to some people about heaven this concept of Heaven in terms of Chinese medicine and things like that and in a western culture, especially in the English language, we sometimes think of Heaven as in the biblical sense.  But in this sense Heaven were referring to the Heavens to the sky it could also be and so then in Chinese you have TN and TN, they're both men sky and I and heaven and this is actually the same in other languages. So you have in Spanish you have Seattle Seattle means both sky and Heaven at the same time and this is in many different languages but in English with it anyway, so you're getting the sustenance of heaven. So this moisture of Heaven is falling down. I'm in response to this creative.  And it's so I guess feeding or nourishing these open mouths that needed it. Doesn't that make sense? Yes. It's almost like this code participatory relationship that the shaman or that a person can have with heaven in order to bring a greater good in that sense. Yeah. Everyone's benefiting from that rain, right? Yes the shamans.  And so I just have an interesting quote here from Lonnie Jarrett who's an very inspiring practitioner in the United States and in his book nourishing Destiny. He says an important part of the healing process often involves returning to our sense of potency empowered by the Ling Spirit. It is essential to help patients experience themselves once again as effective forces in the world and individual with a  Art whose Ling spirit is unbalanced. Maybe unsynchronized in all Realms of lie.  So yeah, so when I was essentially saying in that speech was that this patient was depressed and more than it just being sort of a stagnation of energy or anything like that. I sensed. It was almost like this lack of his own sense of you know, creativity and potency and purpose and just for the viewers that don't know what he's talking about. He gathered talk at College where that's how we come across this topic.  Where you were making this about an actual patient like how you would apply this to a patient? Right? That's right. Yeah, because people don't know what you mean by that stage. It's like work there. Unfortunately. Yeah, so you were applying this house how this applies to a patient. And yeah, so this is really great and in theory like it's it makes total sense. But what about like in an actual person like and it dated dated a person that's struggling like they've clicked on this video or listening to this podcast because I like yeah, I thought so  My purpose and how does this apply to them? Like what's this mean they need to dance around in the rain like a dog. Well in a sense. Yeah, actually it's interesting because when I originally presented this and the fact that I'm the it was about a patient who was experiencing some sort of depression, I guess and what I felt from it, was that rather than it just being merely  Say stagnation of Qi or anything like that was actually a fundamental this connection with the magic of life. And this is very common. I think in modern society especially here in the west because we tend to live we get we can get trapped in a very sort of mundane existence of living a day-to-day working life. And so then that sort of sense of magic that is inherent within life itself gets sort of blocked from  View and this person had seen to have been disconnected from the like Ronnie Garrett says they're real potency and then they're real efficacy in the world. So they didn't really believe in themselves. But also they'd sort of lost that sense of purpose and Magic now interestingly when we joke about becoming a dancing Charmin, but interestingly even this person went dancing then they would feel much better. And so it was this actually dancing in this creative act which awoke  this sense of  I guess joy and positivity and purpose in life. And then it was that act of going back to the sort of mundane existence in the frustrations of working and I'd get lost in that and then that would and so they would look for that Weekly dance session. Yeah to actually connect with those. I guess you could say heavenly energies. So it's actually quite fitting for that character. So yeah, because I think one I mean, I think that's  It's not a surprise to anyone watching this I would I would say but it's so common now in our society that we work for money rather than working for because we want to do that thing. I mean, maybe we started out I see what's of patients like this that started out in a job that I loved because they wanted to do it and I went to that career because I wanted to do it and so there was a purpose and there was a desire for it, but then somewhere along the way it just became this mundane boring thing that they don't have lost connection with it. They don't want to do it anymore, but they can't get out of it because they don't want to lose their house or bit.  The car they need to provide for their kids and their family and it's a trap because then they're like working or spending the majority of the time, you know, half the time sleeping half the time working in this thing. They hate and I knew Living For What like a few hours a week or the weekend to enjoy and what do they do? And they and yeah, it's like then the treatments that they do sort of don't cut it they might have helped a little bit. So they do acupuncture. They do herbs even Western medicine in my like antidepressants or medications.  If people start taking and not saying don't take those medications, but they can help to a certain point. But then what where's that? What's that? What about that little Gap and maybe this is connecting going to connect with people about that little Gap that you know is missing that you could try everything physically till the cows come home. But if you don't fix that issue, if you don't connect with your purpose then it's maybe what is it all for? Hmm? Exactly and it's I'm fascinated by the  The sudden the cosmology of the world view that we live in as a western society that Ike as he said to begin with that. We don't even have this idea embedded in our language has a Chinese dude. And so this is very interesting because in terms of medicine when you go to a GP mostly people would think it would be absurd to say that for that GP to say. Well actually your medicine would be to connect with the magic of life because that's what's missing.  Life and so if I be struck off the rectal exam someone might report them for saying something like that it which is absurd as you said on one hand. Yes, I can see how that that's absurd in the medical field. But on the other hand after listening to that even a little bit of it is it seems like well isn't absurd that you don't mention that hmm exactly and it's and it actually can be explained by how we view the world as Western culture, and I'm very interested in these types of things.  things and I've learned a bit on a course from Rickett honest who's a philosopher psychologist from the United States and he talks about shifting World Views and this is very influential to my thinking and also it ties in with Ling because previously in a more an older time periods human beings were I guess embedded in the  Verse in a way in which they could nature was perceived to be in sold. And so that it wasn't just human beings that had a creative intelligence. But rather the entire all of Nature and all the universe had this sort of inner potency and this creative intelligence. I guess you could say and it was around the time of the so called Enlightenment and the copernican revolution of these things that  That we that that outer world became they say disenchanted and so and this has led to the current worldview in which basically Consciousness is an epiphenomenon. They say of matter and material processes and that only human beings really have this intelligence. And so Ling that character coming from an ancient time period sort of speaks to that and meaning spiritual.  And even magical sort of relates to that way in which all of nature is as a spiritual potency and that we can actually connect with that and so I was thinking about it and it's interesting because if you were to look at a Chinese medical classic probably they would never say that if in this disorder get them to connect with Ling because it didn't need to be said because the worldview in which they were living was a more magical.  Mythical worldview in which that was a given they were already work. They already were inside that and so it's interesting. Like if you look at the shin dong-bin sounding like an old Hubble classic though and you look up long ago where this the Luongo was where it was found. It says in on the banks of rivers and caves and Grottoes where dragons have lived and died. Mmm, and they and certain hubs will be used for ghosts and spectral entities.  And this magical sort of thinking was within the Chinese culture for a very long time even son Samuel in the sort of medieval times would use incantations and almost like magical type. So do you think they had like this just by asking your opinion? I know you none of us can go back to those times. But in that chain on been surging reference, do you think that they actually there were dragons there were big creatures that they  Dragons there or do you think they just had this mythical in thing that they thought that the dragons with her Uncle dragon, or was it a real dragon? Jerk? I'm not sure whether whether it comes from I just wanted I it's got its got no ferry to me. But the tourney dragons are real but not in a physical sense. They live in more of a Mythic part of the yeah, just yeah, which they were connected to. Yeah, and so then the dragon arrives  Is also I mean, it's not a long kids distinct I guess but there is a dragon sort of creature that arises in the west as well. And so there is this lady must have been dragging archetypal but physical dragons at some point because they're so common in all cultures like mentioned right there were mentioned in them the bible stuff like that like that. There must have been I don't know. It must have been those giant dragon creatures that we that we like dinosaur killed off. Yeah, exactly.  Looked like a flying saucer. Anyway, that's this is a sidebar. That was refreshing. So yeah, good. Okay, so people can connect with their like connecting with your purpose is important, right? And so what do you think is maybe you can give us an example from like the case that you presented or like you're just so people don't get misled or anything like Lanes what 30 years Chinese medicine student, so it's not like you're treating lots of patience.  These theoretical ideas. Yes, but if you get to be a all philosophy and but that it's really good. And I think one part about just going back to what you were saying before about that. It was embedded into the culture and that's why it didn't need to be mentioned. There's there's been this push in Chinese medicine, especially in our country in Australia and there lots of people watching this from the US or the UK that's very similar there as well to to westernize.  Seems like what they call modernize things and bring things into line with a more scientific a Western Scientific approach of how we talked about Chinese medicine and there's nothing wrong with understanding things from different paradigms. I think in using that Paradigm, but I almost feel like the this Paradigm of the Linguistics and the understanding of the true nature of Chinese medicine is being lost amongst the knee.  Need to show the scientific Cruise know what works because it's hard to eat you could design a research trial you got people to discover their purpose and see what happened at but it's probably much more in line with psychology than what is in stocks and a Chinese medicine. So even like you're saying it would be hard to be hard-pressed to come to a doctor and for them to say. Hey, you're feeling depressed. Have you thought about a person's weight when you have you have you have you thought about how is that going?  But even a Chinese medicine practitioner probably won't go that as a matter of just general conversation, right? Yes, and but I think it's a hugely important thing because I think part of almost evolution is modern human beings is to reconnect with what we have lost. Yeah, Rich, is that understanding of the intelligence of nature?  Nature and to be able to connect with nature in the sense that these charms are connecting with the rain in that sense and to regain a bit of that notion that there is we are living within and then solve the universe and that things aren't just for dead in a yeah. Okay. So let's talk about that a little bit more because maybe people are thinking I'd like to reconnect with my purpose. What do I need to do? But how do they how do they connect how do they understand this interconnectiveness of nature? Well, actually  It could be many different things that I remember. I was listening to a actually an interview with Lily and bridges who's a face reader and really wonderful woman. It's Avail Sansa and she was talking about Ling and she looked at some she had a patient and she looked at him and she said oh your link efficient or something like that and then he said, okay, and she and she said her prescription for him was to go outside every day lie on the grass and just look at the clouds. Mmm.  And so and then just doing this then like he went back a few weeks later and he was feeling much better explain to her how much better he was feeling a real transformation. And now this may seem absurd to some people but really it's the simple Act of connecting with the magic of life that can be the greatest medicine and times. So for this person just laying down on the grass and looking at the clouds and reconnecting with that fundamental sense of  Or and mystery and wonder at the fact that there are clouds existing at all. And so this is something that is sort of in born in us when we're children and we can look at all things and we can see the magic in it. But as we grow and priorities get diverted into education and these such things we will  Lonnie Jarrett based on the work of a Taoist practitioner called Louis Ming calls it sort of the mundane accretions. So when we're living we build up these accretions, I guess yes an accretion a creation like a think of it as sort of like a solidification. So this isn't you in there is our true nature say is Young. Yeah, so it's like sediment building exactly exactly.  That is an influence of the I guess the mundane material was set a bit of the Mondays. I'm sure lots of people camera like it's like, oh just another day instead of exactly here we go. Again. It's so true. It's so true. And I think the reason why maybe people do think oh that's absurd like they go to a doctor. I should've been prescribed and minutes in the in nature and I've seen some articles floating around. I'll see if I can pose some up here. I'll put the link below of doctors in  Other it's more European countries. I've seen doing that prescribing people nature walks and stuff like that as part of their treatment and there's been some research on these areas because it's like well I could just I could have just got that myself. But you know, like I could have just I didn't come to you for the sunshine of Rainbow Oh Katie from medicated that like, it's like a doctor's of The Gatekeepers to this stuff. Whereas maybe they should be the facilitators or when I say doctors having healthcare Works including myself in those things.  We should be the facilitators of this knowledge and helping people to work towards a path. It's not just necessarily. Well. I needed sell you this medication. I need a I need to give you something. You can't get anywhere else. Yeah, it's I think people maybe they don't value it as much like 10 minutes of sunshine or lying in the grass looking at the clouds because they think well, I could have just done that myself. Exactly. Well if you watch his podcast you might be able to but yeah, this is do it yourself.  Yeah, but yeah, it's interesting because that leads to almost like a redefinition of what the practitioner is and what they do because really they should have the best interest of the patient. So whether that perhaps a patient needs weeks of acupuncture and herbs and yet another one might simply need like a to be, you know, LED down a path that leads them just to looking at Clouds for example or doing something of that nature. Yeah, and I think I'm practitioners who do prescribe they that  They don't prescribe the sunshine and rainbows and they just prescribe what they that's what they doing the best they can with what they know and yeah, okay, maybe we could argue that they should know better and they could share they could expand their Consciousness so they could expand their ideas. But a lot of people are a lot of practitioners and doctors are doing it with the best. They think they've got the patient's best interests at heart. Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah always have the other side of the coin where people are, you know, doing it for money and find ourselves. So it's also used something. But yeah, let's not get into a debate.  About the pharmaceutical industry on this today. Let's take it. Let's keep it Mars nor am I anyway, that's alright. But when you when you are you'll get your fair share of backlash anyway, so yeah, so okay people can connect with nature in some way. So it might be something that they might seem insignificant is what I'm picking up from what you're saying. It might seem just like a little thing but it is actually going to give you big returns if you're actually engaging in doing it and you'll absolutely I think  If we say take that the character again is a symbol of what it means. So we have the creative act of the shamans that are done. So there's lots of applications for this right like it's not just dancing around or looking at clouds in to connect with nature. What else do you reckon? This like character could be implying and that creativity for shamans Dancing Yeah. Well, this is where I think the creativity and the symbol of the shaman also ties in with actually.  You're saying before about one's life purpose. So acting out in the world creatively what one essentially is. And so if we think about a shaman their role as in especially in ancient days was to sort of some in the rain and to do those rain dances and this is sort of I guess Universal shamans around the world. So they have this creative act which express itself through dancing and it had the effect on nature. But whether we're a shaman or not and  99.9 percent of us are known then we we all have a creative act that can have a response from life itself and also comes about to benefit the others just as they were bringing down the rain to sort of Feed the community or the tribe and to help the Earth to grow so we can also have that and so I personally believe and it might not be the easiest thing to find and myself. I took a long time to actually find it but we certainly  have our own unique gift to bring into the world and it could be through cooking. It could be through music. It could be through writing. It could be through coordinating groups. It could be through Public Communication and it could be through gardening. It could be through anything. But when we take that as the dance of the shaman as a creative act and we put our spirit into that then we find our place in the world.  And then that way we're actually serving our community and serving life itself. Just as you can think of like a cell in the body might be a blood cell and its purpose is to be an individual blood cell but also to serve the common good of the organism of the body. So when we think consider ourselves as a organism of our family of our culture of the human race and of Earth as a whole then we  Can feel much more fulfilled and we can creatively act out our purpose. Yes. It does. My it makes total sense. Yeah. Sure. I can't help but think like I think about this a lot like in our society think about that when you talk about worldviews and stuff how like most most people watching this are probably in dredged and entrenched in a capitalist society and even to the point where and I'm not having a go at these situations because that's just how we've got two things but even to the point where  People get paid to care for a loved one. And if you if that's you you're getting paid to care for a loved one. I'm not having a go at you or just a comment I guess on where we've how we've because everything is so monitored monetize. Everything is so much as Harry about and that is that seems to be the value that we or if we don't get that monetary value from something we tend to not do it or not. We don't associate things. Maybe I put it another way like things that you don't get a monetary return from you tend to think of  Them as failures or not as you don't associate them with a benefit whereas our society actually if you look at how will I don't want to stray Leah. There's a lot of things that are basically running in the background of the power of volunteers. Right most there's no money involved in paying those people for their time and you might everything takes money. So I'm not saying that's not have any money because we we think we need money, but it's just something to think about I think  In terms of like how did we get to this point where everything is so value? And and so I guess what I'm saying is I see a lot of people in the Arts as well that they struggle to sort of see the benefit of their art their creative art because it doesn't have a monetary value and the capitalist in me says well, that means you are isn't very valuable that it's not very successful. It's terrible because no one wants to buy it, but on the other hand, there are deceive me says well you  Should still do it and the practitioner May says that's it's a if you get that better for if that is your Ling if that is your creative purpose and your you're meant to be doing that. You should be done at no matter whether you get money or not. Yeah money from it and then the cycle continues the capital of survey says it. Well, if if you are meant to be doing it, then you would be good at it and then you get money from it. And so maybe just stop doing it long enough for you to monetize our or you might not be good at the business side of it to get the money from its make it.  So my back I'm talking about people that want to make their creative Pursuit their living. Hmm. They want to be and they don't necessarily want to have a million dollar match and the you know, like a hip-hop style because  With the CAT scan. I just want to like they just don't want to have to work in there during the 9 to 5 job anymore. They'd like to be able to monetize their art and their all their creative Pursuit. Let's say whatever it is so that they don't have to do that mundane thing. Yeah, it's just I know it's a conundrum is a conundrum. Yeah, and it's in a difficult thing because it's not about just abandoning your day job to go look at Clouds, but it's sort of finding the balance and accepting the reality that we  Currently live in the situation. And so then I will do what I need to do within that but at the same time finding the space and the time to devote to your own creativity or to connecting with life and in a deeper sense, and so that actually when that happens you can then give to whatever it is, whatever job you maybe even if it's something that you don't particularly want to be working. If you can have that connection with something greater, which is that sort of I guess spiritual connection with yourself and with  Life then even that fills the most mundane of tasks with a sense of wonder and purpose and so you can give fully to that. But if you're fully and completely just embedded in the encrustations or whatever you set up the of that sediment sediments of that of Lies, then it's difficult to get to see through that and find the Wonder in it and to see that  Having a glass that's you know, it is crusty and it's all set of and T. It takes time to clean it. You can like soak it in something to get the most out of it to get all that said my offer a but then once it's clear, you can see through that glass, you know to two layers of glass you can see really clearly through it and it doesn't take much to keep it clean and to keep it clear. So I guess that's maybe where a practitioner would come in and might it might be a Chinese herbalist or an acupuncturist. It might be another maybe even  psychology or some other practitioners that would be able to help you get your glass clear again and get rid of some of that sediment work out. I think psychology would probably be one of the better places you could go to or a practitioner that has a decent understanding of psychology. Mmm. Also meditation. There are some really great meditation courses. I've personally practice vipassana and that's an excellent technique but and there are other many techniques that have been sort of  Devised and cultivated all around the world and spiritual traditions and things like that. But for sure I think like acupuncture hubs and these types of things have that potential because if we think about sort of the channels and the organs as they can as they flow through us, but then connect out into the world. They also they they mediate our connection with external and internal life and reality. So if so by treating that we can actually assist the patient  To have a deeper connection with themselves and midlife also and in a very broad sense people that are sort of maybe not aware but acupuncture is the best at moving things around was herbes is probably the best at when it can still move things around it can still give you a good perjure. That's what hey, but it's really better at putting substance in your body because it does you're taking a substance in you and it's helping you replenish and rebuild and so when you go to see a practitioner, I mean, that's the difference between so I guess  Watching watching a podcast or would look at trying to do it yourself on Google or something like that that a practitioner is going to be able to understand where you are in the spectrum of things. Like do you just need a little bit of a shift? Do you need a bit of a purge? Do you need like just substance put in you to help you rebuild yourself? And if you've watched our other videos, I've done like talk about five elements wood fire earth metal water and I would say this more relates to like the wood element of thought of life in a way, right? So like because what is about purpose?  Said about doing new things and creativity and Springtime and the five elements cycle kind of lets us understand that like nothing nothing staying the same at any like you have five you have four seasons in a year. If you follow the Chinese way, they would say Five Seasons, but that's another video. It's that but the idea that okay. Nothing stays the same that's that's that's something to be thankful for I guess is that if you're going through a bad time nothing's going to stay in that you can  It stay like that forever. It's there will be a change coming and even if you're in a good a good citizen of life, if you don't do the right things, if you neglect to do the right things you'll end up coming to a detriment. Yeah, so I don't want to get into another project. I think with a different ramble, but the other thing you mentioned I think is really important. I like to talk about that a bit more. It was the mystery right because I think again Western Society  I was going to say communist Ed. Yeah bizarre that capitalism has kind of pushed us into this thing of like they have to know everything we have to know how and that I think that's one thing is why maybe in that in that pursuit of knowing and that knowledge and needing to know when scientific validation for things we because we couldn't understand there's lots of things now. We're okay so scientific understanding I'm not saying we throw that away, but there's things like you mentioned meditation that's having a massive Resurgence now,  Mindfulness as well one is because our modern technology allows us to study the effects of it and so we can prove it and we can say oh look, like I'm they've even done studies with put people in an MRI machine and make them look at trees. They even looking at Dre's is you know, I say that like, it's like it confirms what we should why don't we one is why don't we just trust this ancient knowledge. We need more. We need an MRI machine to kind of confirm it now it is nice to have that confirmation on to know that but at the same time that pursuit of knowing  Everything it's like you mentioned before about being a child. That wonder what do you think about that? Like how that's how do you think about how that's been lost to think? It's your well that's a very dear topic to me actually because I really love being a child and I remember being like three or four and crying and my birthday and I'm Sid way crying and I said, I don't want to be a year older. I like saying the same age. My mom said that's okay. Look at your father some men never grow up. And so but there is number that is  but so to me, there's something extremely yeah precious about childhood and about imagination and as I grew up and I continue to like to imagine things. I personally found that I had to limit that and to restrict that and to stop the sense of play and Imagination because then suddenly I had to conform to education to you to wearing a uniform to standing in line to doing learning how to do division and learning how to spell my name when really I just wanted to  The playing in a world of dinosaurs in these types of things and so that which I consider to be my authentic nature and that sort of imagine it and living in that imaginary realm was I guess in a sense deprived from me and I had to conform to what Society deems giving your child and thinking this is being deprived from me or is it something you look back on now and think know something I look back on now, but I can I still can feel this inside.  Ation of what that meant for me at the time and so that topic of childhood and maintaining that in a sense of child is one of my biggest passions in life. So how many people do that people that are watching this now and I thinking yeah, that's me. I feel like they feel very disconnected from that sense. What would you suggest what's worked for you to reconnect with our well what's worked with me might not work for everybody because it took me a very long journey, but basically for me.  It's just a lot of self-exploration and lots of the way it manifested in. My life was through traveling through lots of different countries for meeting all the different people through very strange and outlandish experiences, and it was just a very I put a lot of intense effort into my own image and he said and I was living in isolated places and that in the Amazon and in places like this and so  Eventually over time I came to this sort of.  Experience of myself and of life, but also managed to see that kind of this Center. I'm gonna ask you another question. How do you okay? So that's its I think that's amazing that you've done that and if like you don't have to necessarily spending 11 years journey to do that was 11 years ago about nine years, so you don't necessarily have to spend a massive amount of time doing it and you can  I think you did people should do what they want. They can like. Yeah that maybe the ten minutes in the clouds. It's better than nothing at all. Right, but what about coming back to society? Right? It seems like you have you know, like you've been in school what so now for like three years and you have to conform in a way like have to get money and and live and do you find that now? Yeah. Okay. Yes. You went on one hand, you're studying your your passion and your following the  Park but do you find that there's a conflict there at times but I think more than anything going to agus to one extreme allowed me to then come back to an equilibrium so that when I come back into this this the society which I used to previously reject I can do it more willingly and I can sort of see what's it doing. Okay, what do you do now? Let's say a couple of  Years, you haven't been living in the Amazon or anything like that have you know that you're slipping away from that childlike wonder and the Mystery what can people do in their day-to-day life? That would help them reconnect with that. Do you just imagine yourself back in the Amazon? Like what? No, I personally I find huge benefit in  Yes, I meditate a couple of times a day. How long would you meditate for just about an hour a day like this when you just one block or in one block? Yeah, but that I've done quite a few quite a lot of meditation. So but even if it was five minutes or something like that, but that want to get started in meditation, but never done it before what would they do if they get involved? Well, a lot of people I think they just use  Guided meditation or something like that you can download but also the way I Learned was through these the called vipassana VIP Asin a courses and they're all around the world, which is excellent. So no matter essentially what content here on and so they attend a courses, but therefore if you really want to learn because they attend a course is and you meditate 10 hours a day. Wow. It's in silence. You're not allowed to talk to anyone. But yeah.  They give you food, they give you board everything and they give you the teaching and so you can do these courses. So I've done it does anyone so wait on day one and I already yeah. Well I was when I was living in Venezuela, I was assisting so I was like, I'm volunteering to work for the cause and I'm the yeah II morning someone came up to me and he said no, this is not my bag. I'm leaving it in anymore. So that's not for everyone. It's a good discipline though. I think it's  it's good to try new experiences. Like you said and be open. I think one of the things with the mystery is like trying to get away from I have to know everything about this exactly just can some things just just can something's just be mystical and I think the other one that I want to mention for people is like just there's such a pressure on people to use social media and to be and when you when you are actively a part of social media use  And to give away a lot of the mystery so I might go to a barbecue with friends and family and I know what's been going on everything. There's nothing to talk about in a way. I mean on one hand, it's good because you feel connected. So I'm not it's another conundrum. There's lots of conundrums in life, you know, you feel connected because you're saying I've had a baby you've done this you've had this blah blah blah, but on the other hand, there's no surprise. There's no mystery. I mean there might be maybe people don't put everything there, but I know some people it seems like  You'd be surprised if there was anything else to talk about that they haven't provides exactly. Yeah, so, you know what type of pants they're wearing what size they are what the new shoes that they've got troubles that have happened and good things or bad things. I just think it's nice to have that mystery about people. It's absolutely something to all there's something I want to get to like. There's something about you. I want to know more I want to kind of and I think yeah, it's a conundrum for me as a person that runs.  Several businesses like you want to you need to put stuff out there because you want people to purchase your product or look at, you know, watch other watch the video subscribe to the channel that kind of stuff but it but you don't want to give everything away and I think even in your business, you don't give everything away or once obviously because you need to keep people coming back to get more and more and that's what like we are attracted to that mystery want to know if I told a half a story now people be angry because they want to know the ending.  Where's the end of that story? Yeah, and I think that childlike mystery is something that we need to get back in touch with more and more right just happening. Absolutely when I something that really struck me when I was first in the jungle in the Amazon was the profound mystery of the place because like you say, we live in a society where we think we know about everything and we can very deep in very minor detail explain the material world.  We can't really say who we are why we're here and we don't really understand the inner dynamics of our self and of life and but living in this world we tend to think that there is no sort of magic or anything like that or mystery. So I remember being in the jungle and there it's just permeated by mystery because people talk to you completely seriously about what we would deem sort of mythical beings and and  Situations that come and so whether it be the pink dolphins are the of the rivers that can turn into human beings and how their Uncle drowned because they were led into the water by one of these mythical one of these Dolphins. It turned into a human being and laid them in there or these enormous snakes and he's on this limp like spirits that people communicate with and things like that. And so and they talk about it in such a serious way that you can't help but believe them and then I  So they had some sort of mind opening experiences of my own in relation to these types of things. And so it just showed me that one year in the heart of Nature. And in a sense there you're just surrounded by Jungle by trees by water and human beings no longer have this central place where they're surrounded by all of their own Creations their buildings and and you're in the bosom of the mystery and it's permeates through and you no longer a shore.  What life is and you kind of lose your solid footing a little bit and it's interesting too because then when we that's an external level, but I personally think that we ourselves are very much like that once we get through initial to and this is my meditation is so great because when we dedicate ourselves to look inside and connect with what we really are, we start to move through the very structured sort of cities of our mind and our thoughts and our belief.  And then when we get into that sort of more unconscious level we find that actually wear that mysterious jungle that is full of darkness and strange creatures and all these things. And so that mystery the most profound mystery lies within us but most of the time were dedicated to the outside world and so we're not actually in tuning ourselves to do that. Yeah get to that. He's like a drain exactly and I can't get rid of the dreamer. They're just like, oh they might have a strainer occurs.  If you talk to my psychologist, they're like well, that means something that's your subconscious trying to tell you something and they end. Yeah, we just ignore these signals from inside even internally body signals. We just fob off as I will I must have eaten something bad. That's why I feel that feeling like physical feelings can happen to our body because our mind in Chinese medicine with the calipers are sharing is trying to contact with us and trying to let us know and we don't really  You that much attention to it just dismiss those things exactly and the dream is a really good point because a dream like we connect with that sort of magical aspect of ourselves every single day every night when we go to sleep and yet if we have a profound experience in that then we'll over the side and say, oh it's just a dream and yet when we are experiencing it can actually see more real than when then when in Waking Life. Yeah, but can be very lucky Leaf you with a very lingering feeling like you're not  Not you can't articulate it can't verbalize it properly but you've just got this feeling that you can't let go or something's something's different. And then you think oh, that's just a Java and you fob it off and get on with it get on with the day. Yeah, I think because it's comes back to society what Society values again money like you can't really make money out of you know, some of these things that you tweet that and then just in society before things office or they're not important. Yeah, but they are important to us and I think it's been  Valuable having this conversation having this chat. And is there anything else you want to talk about? No, I think I just personally like as we've established. I'm not so experienced in practicing anything but just through my own experiences and through my own connections with life. I've come to realize that this what is I guess symbolized by Ling is such a profound form of healing and  and in a large part requires the act of the individual so rather than generally we think when we're sick, then we can go to the doctor and they're going to treat us but when it comes to this type of healing it's a participatory thing so we can go I guess and we can get these treatments. But if we're not I guess putting our own work into it and I and our own intention into discovering this mystery of ourselves and the magic of life on Earth.  Creative purpose then. I don't know if we'll ever really get there. Yeah, we only get so far you get to visit what and that's where I see patients. Just keep have to keep coming in for treatment and I don't turn those people away. But at the same time as a practitioner believe it or not. We don't want to have to keep coming in. We want you to get better and be discharged and be be on your way at some point, but it's like yeah, there's something so I can Chinese medicine I think of the cause of disease and one of those causes of diseases lifestyle.  So and one of the lifestyle causes of disease is like like it is it should be probably better articulated as this like I think this purpose the sling should be part of it, but when just two diagnoses wipe it but when the Communists came in to put their flavor onto Chinese medicine so around the 1950s when China most likely what happened with Chinese medicine is all the different kinds of systems of Chinese medicine.  What kind of accumulated into one traditional Chinese medicine and that's what they made they gave did a lot of formalization of things and one of the things they said in the in the stock standard. These are the causes of disease one was work goons or right so work as in like I think that well when I first learned it in back in as a seventeen-year-old I was like, oh, yeah that makes total sense here. Your work is your purpose right? And it is it is in a way, but I can see that now it's probably also part of a communist thing.  You're bluffing are your work your work is your purpose and you will make it your phone because we gave you that job, but there is that your work as in what you do you could take that to me like what you do and what you do in your day-to-day life really like it's what you do in your day-to-day life that if you can structure your life towards that be more purposeful and that being more what you are designed to do. You will feel more happiness and a great resource that I give my patients is  With each from a psychologist called Martin Seligman, he formulated the happiness movement or the happiness kind of psychology and he talks about discovering like your strengths and then looking at your strength. So for people that are watching this that are like at a level of like you feel like you're at Rock Bottom you feel like you're so depressed. You don't feel like there's any inkling of any purpose there. That would be a very good place to start is you can go on to I'll put the link below. It's called VI a strengths. It's a free thing. I'm not affiliated.  Or anything with them or like in this isn't a paper ocean. It's just a resource that I use a lot and you can do this test for free and you can find out what your strengths are and then you can start from there and you can start to utilize the things that make like give you a sense of connection with what you're meant to be connecting with so like Fritz it's a might be if it's appreciation of beauty and then the way to go about it would be every day pick.  Something a different way you could utilize appreciation of beauty. So it might be lying on the ground and looking up at the clouds. It might be going outside and finding some beautiful flowers or trees or something or appreciating Beauty even going around your own house and finding five beautiful things. Whereas if that's not a strength for you. You might have been listening back before your very eyes never lie down and look at the clouds like that sounds like a waste of time because there might be something else that you're more wide for and that would be your link. That would be your purpose right? Absolutely.  Your Shaman dancing in to produce the rain, right? So not everyone's wide exactly the same and even Chinese medicine kind of recognizes that in other ways. So fantastic. It's been such a great talk. I'm something so happy to do this. Yeah, and so will put all the links Below in the description in the description.

I look forward to seeing you again soon and we might have gone back on to talk about.  Or stuff because he's a wealth of knowledge and even though like actually I know some people with four degrees that can't articulate as good as you can let's fix your light and so it's not about having a degree or having a being a practitioner that's for qualified only thing I wanted to to talk today because you've got a wealth of knowledge and it's just that also that journey is important and so you I mean you could get tons of degrees.  But if you didn't put that that nine years even you wouldn't be the same person, right? Absolutely. Yeah, and yeah if I could just share one last night. Yeah, it'd be that I myself I went to sort of to one extreme which is just in a sense just to pursue the mental the psychic the spiritual and all these types of things and But ultimately it was the biggest lesson was that true if you insist spirituality spirituality is to  Bring your findings of the internal into the external so that you actually participate in the greater whole of humanity and of of the earth Community, I guess you could say and so in a sense that there's a huge value and benefit saying staying in a cave and meditating say and being a complete ascetic. But especially in this time of life. What we really need is for people to then share that  Once the community and to help other people so in a sense, it's that moving towards a greater sense of wholeness not just within oneself but within the external so then that sort of balances the called the ascending and descending or internally external individual with the collective. And so that was a big lesson for me was that to return to the body and this is such a blessing of Chinese medicine to that all of this is found in the body and to come to a tangible sense of  Of that magic rather than the Escape is tendency to just yeah, that's a big lost in my mind. Yeah Skype is we can have another conversation about that. Yeah. I know that quite well, I mean, I think that's why people do the things that they do like they get we get trapped in these habits of doing stuff to escape the fact that we don't have a purpose. I really like on and off, you know, Russell Brand's stuff online. He's got he's got heaps of he's got this under the skin podcast as well.  And so a couple of other just just--hey just--hey stuff that he's been doing recently. It's very much in touch with that and something you mentioned before we started which we never talked about was like why you think this is important now or why it's popular now is because there's is it because it's just this massive need for it now, I think yeah, I think this is personally I find it's really a fascinating thing. I think if we look back saying the Chinese medical text most probably you're not going to find any  Option to connect with link because as we spoke about that was sort of a given that we're living. It's like if you can imagine a fish swimming in water, they're swimming already within that water but since the time of the Enlightenment and the sort of disenchantment of the cosmos, we all of that has been condensed within us and now we look out in a material world in which there is no magic and we've also lost that sort of a sense of purpose which is great because it's made us more individuals or autonomous beings, but I think for the  Evolution of our planet if we are to survive with all the current prices in that we need to connect with nature itself. Not just on a material Level with Statistics and all these things which are hugely important but connect with it on an internal level and that involves like connecting with with what sling in a sense represents. So I was thinking about that the other day that although you probably won't find it as a medicinal remedy.  In the past it perhaps could be yeah in the presence of a prescribed prescribed in the sense to the whole of humanity so that we can get through the current predicament that were in. Yeah. Yeah, and so that we can work with nature just as the shamans are working with nature to do the creative act and be in sync with the movements of nature with the rain so that we can achieve in ourselves to Nature not just on an external level of intellectual knowledge.  Actually in a deep level of finding the meaning within life. Yeah, so that we can a tune ourselves to the cosmos in that sense that we can live as one with. I think it's also like because of Technology, it's allowed us not to be at the mercy of nature em anymore. And so like let's say, you know because of electricity for one, we don't have to, you know, Turn the Lights we can have the lights on all night and be up all night if we want whereas if you didn't have electricity  You wouldn't be able to do all the things you can do. So we were at one point. We were at the mercy and we've gone to this point if I owe now, we can control nature in a way that we can we can have ultimate control or do like air conditioning right? You don't have to go. Oh, it's so hot and that's a whole nother thing. I did a podcast episode just me talking the a few weeks ago on that on that topic that it says you got to find the where you fit in that spectrum of being at the mercy of Nature and controlling that you're in if you could if you  Control it to the point where you don't respect it anymore. You're not in tune with it anymore because you're like right I own this far as I'm going to cut down all these trees to make a hundred tables and sell them whatever you going to do with it. Like that's that's the one end of the spectrum versus the other end of this spectrum of you know, not having not having a sore big enough meal big enough to do that, which is what we had before we had. You know, we just didn't have the technology to destroy nature as  we do now, but there's got to be a balance there right somewhere in between there. Yeah, like an equilibrium between the two and I think yeah and I think it's that same balance of connecting the inner with the external because and the the move towards, you know, living in physical reality with the living in sort of a more intangible reality so that all of these things need to be combined and brought into balance and like you said now that there's such a movement towards  Meditating or seeking out Chinese medicine and all these things seems to be a sign that human beings are searching for this. What what has been lost. Yeah. And so yeah, it's good. It starts with the searching. So thank if in fact thanks for thanks for searching and finding us here. And so I'm probably just going to leave it there today. But yeah, we will have another chat about this stuff. So so it's so interesting and if you like this content, you've got other questions or you'd like  Learn to ask at see your other questions. Why don't you put them in the comments below and we'll have him back on again, and we'll chat about your other questions about your existential being and your life purpose and Wing. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us today. Thank you for having me. Yeah, no problem. It's my pleasure and we look forward to seeing you again on the next episode.
You're listening to creepy videos for kids.  This story is called The Pale Man no, and it's by Julius long and it was written in 1934. So this is not Slender Man. How is it creepy? It's pretty creepy. Yeah, well give you nightmares. I I think it's not as creepy as the clown story that I think okay good. It's enough that you'll be like whoo, you'll get killed and often.  I give you a little bit of the case of the Goosebumps. Maybe I think you'll I mean like you'll fulfill your for sure going to get goosebumps. Yeah, like you're gonna get Shivers, which is I think it's a level up above Goosebumps and should we give a warning of  Hey, you might be afraid to turn out the lights or is it that level I think hotels will creep you out. Okay, so  Now to everyone anyone who's listening to this, I wouldn't if you are afraid of hotels after this I wouldn't go on vacation in like no, I don't like it. But what if  What is like when you can do time out? Like if it gets too creepy, you can say poop time out.  Yo-yo time out. Okay.  Yeah, but let's just get to the story. Okay, then doing it. Let's do this The Pale Man.  Yeah, I know.  Not fair, not fair Allen.  Okay, let her do it ready. Okay, let's do this The Pale Man. No, okay. How about this you only get three timeouts and you've used to already?  No, no. No. Do you want all three? Okay, then use them wisely sound like a deal. Okay, let's do this. I have not yet met the man and number 212 I do not even know his name. He never patronizes the hotel restaurant and he does not use the lobby on the three occasions when we passed each other by we did not speak. Although we nodded in a semi cordial non-committal way I should very much.  Much like to make his acquaintance. It's Lonesome in this dreary place with the exception of the aged lady down the corridor. The only permanent guests are the man in number 212 and myself. However, I should not complain for this other quiet is precisely what the doctor prescribed. I wonder if the man and number 212 to has come here for a rest. He's so very pale yet. I cannot believe that he is ill for his paleness is not of a sickly cast but rather hole.  Awesome in its Ivory Clarity his Carriage. Is that of a man enjoying the best of health he is tall and straight. He walks, erect lie and with brisk Athletics tried, his pallor is no doubt congenial else. He would quickly tan under this Burning Summer Sun.  He must have traveled here by Auto for he clearly was not a passenger on the train that brought me and he checked in only a short time after my arrival. I had briefly rested in my room and was walking down the stairs when I encountered him thus ending with his bag. It has odd that our venerable Bill boy did not show him to his room. It is odd to that was so many vacant rooms in the hotel. He should have chosen number 212 number 212 at the extreme rear the building is a  Narrow, a fair three stories high the rooms are all on the east side as the West Wall is flush with a decrepit business building. The corridor is long and drab and it's stiff bloated paper exudes a musty unpleasant odor the feeble electric bulbs that light It Shine dimly as from a tomb revolted by this Corridor. I insisted vigorously upon being given number 201 which is at the front and blessed with Southern Exposure the room Clerk.  Kirk a disagreeable fellow with a Hitler mustache was very reluctant to let me have it as it's ordinarily reserved for his more profitable transient trade. I fear my stubborn insistence has made him an enemy. If only I had been a self-assertive 30 years ago. I should now be a full-fledged Professor instead of a broken-down assistant. I still smart from the Cavalier manner in which the president of the University similarily recommended my vacation. No doubt he acted for my best interests the people  Who have dominated my poor life and never really have oh, well the Summers restful probably do me considerable good its pleasant to be away from the University. There's something positively gratifying about the absence of The Graduate students face. If only it were not so lonely. I must devise a way of meeting The Pale Man and number 212 perhaps the room clerk can arrange matters.  I have been here exactly a week and if there is a friendly soul in this miserable little town he has escaped my notice although the tradespeople except my money with flattering eagerness. They studiously avoid even the most casual conversation. I'm afraid I can never cultivate their society unless I can arrange to have my ancestors recognized as local residents for the last hundred and fifty years despite the coolness of my reception. I have been frequently venturing abroad and the back of my mind. I have cherished hopes that I might encounter the  The Old Man and number 211 incidentally, I wonder why he has moved from number 212 there are certainly a little advantage in coming only one room near to the front. I noticed the change yesterday when I saw him coming out of his new room, but he nodded again and this time I thought I detected a certain malign satisfaction in his sombre black eyes. He must know that I am eager to make his acquaintance yet his manner forbids overtures if he wants to make me go all the way he can go to the devil. I'm not the sort to run after.  or anybody indeed the Surly diffidence of the room clerk has been enough to prevent me from questioning him about his mysterious guest  I wonder where the pale man takes his meals. I've been Epson Ting myself from the hotel restaurant and patronizing the restaurants outside at each. I have ventured inquiries about the man and number two ten not no one at any restaurants remembered his having been there perhaps he has his entree into the Brahman homes of this town. And again, he may have found a boarding house. I shall have to learn if there be one The Pale Man must be difficult to please for he has again changed his room I am  I felt by his conduct if see his if he is so desirous of locating himself more conveniently in the hotel. Why does he not move to number 202 which is the nearest available room to the front perhaps I can make his inability to locate himself permanently an excuse for starting a conversation. I see her closer neighbors now, I might casually say but that's too banal. I must await a better opportunity. He's done it again. He's now occupying 209  fine. I am intrigued by his little game. I waste hours trying to Fathom its Point. What possible motive could he have I should think he would get on the hotel peoples nerves. I wonder what our combination bellhop chambermaid things of having to prepare for rooms for a single guest if he were not stone-deaf, I would ask him at present. I feel too exhausted to attempt such a nerve rating conversation. I'm tremendously interested in the pale man's next move. He must either skipper.  Or remain where he is for a permanent guest a very old lady occupies 208. She has not budged from her room since I have been here and I imagine that she does not intend to I wonder what the pill man will do my weight his decision with the nervous excitement of a devotee of the track on the eve of a big race after all I have so little diversion.  Well, the mysterious guest was not forced to remain where he was nor. Did he have to skip a room the lady in number 208 simplified Matters by conveniently dying. No one knows the cause of her death, but it's generally attributed to old age. She was buried this morning. I was among the Curious few who attended her funeral when I returned home from the mortuary. I was there in time to see the Pale Man leaving her room.  Already, he's moved in. He favoured me with a smile whose meanings. I have tried in vain to decipher. I cannot believe that he meant to have some significance he acted as if there were some between us a secret that I had failed to appreciate but then perhaps his smile was meaningless after all Unholy ambiguous by chance like that of the Mona Lisa.  My Man of Mystery now resides in number 207 and I am not the least surprised I would have been astonished he have not made his scheduled move I have almost given up trying to understand his eccentric conduct I do not know a single thing more about him than I knew the day he arrived I wonder whence he came there is something in definitely foreign about his manner. I'm curious to hear his voice. I like to imagine that he speaks the Exotic tongue of some Faraway country. If only I could somehow  Jim into a conversation. I wish that I were possessed of the glib Assurance of a college boy who can address himself to the most distinguished celebrity without batting an eye. It's no wonder I'm only an assistant professor.  I am worried this morning. I awoke to find myself lying prone upon the floor. I was fully clothed. I must have fallen exhausted there after I returned to my room last night. I wonder if my condition is more serious than I had expected until now. I've been inclined to Discount the fears if those who had pulled a long face about me for the first time. I recall the prolonged handclasp of the president when he bade goodbye from the University. Obviously. He never expected to see me alive again.  Of course. I am not that unwell nevertheless. I must be more careful. Thank heaven. I have no dependents to worry about I have not even a wife for I was never willing to exchange the loneliness of a bachelor for the loneliness of a husband. I cannot say in all sincerity that the prospect of death does not frighten me speculation about life beyond the grave is always bored me whatever it is or is not I'll try to get along. I've been so preoccupied about the sudden turn of my own Affairs that I  Neglected to make note of the most extraordinary incident The Pale Man Has Done an astounding thing. He skipped three rooms and moved all the way to number 203 we are now very close neighbors. We shall meet often are in my chances for making his acquaintance are now greater.  I have confined myself to my bed during the last few days and have had my food brought to me. I even called a local doctor whom I suspect to be a quack. He looked over me with a professional indifference and told me not to leave my room for some reason. He does not want me to climb stairs for this bit of information. He received a ten dollar bill, which is I directed him. He fished out of my coat pocket a pickpocket couldn't have done it better. He had not been gone long when I was visited by the room clerk the  These suggested with a great show of kindly concern that I use the facilities of the local hospital. It was so modern and all that but more firmness than I have been able to muster in a long time. I gave him to understand that I intended to remain where I am frowning. Sullenly. He stiffly retired. The doctor must have paused long enough downstairs to tell him a pretty story. It's obvious that he is afraid I should die in his best room.  The Pale Man is up to his old tricks last night when I taught her down the hall the door of number 202 was ajar without thinking I looked inside the Pale Man sat in the rocking chair. I'll only smoking a cigarette he looked up into my eyes and smile that peculiar ambiguous smile that has so deeply puzzled me I moved on down the corridor not so much mystified is annoyed the whole mystery of the man's conduct is beginning to irk me. It's also a name so utterly  Lacking in motive. I feel that I shall never meet The Pale Man, but at least I'm going to learn his identity tomorrow. I shall ask the room Clerk and deliberately interrogate him.  I know now. I know the identity of the Pale Man and I know the meaning of his smile.  Early this afternoon. I summoned the room clerk to my bedside. Please tell me I asked abruptly who is the man and number 202 the clerk stared wearily and uncomprehendingly. You must be mistaken that room is an occupied. Oh, but it is I snapped an irritation. I myself saw the man there only two nights ago. He is tall handsome fellow with dark eyes and hair. He's unusually pale he checked in the day that I arrived.  The hotel man regarded me dubiously as if I were trying to impose upon him, but I assure you there's no such person in this house as for checking in when you did you were the only guest we registered that day.  What why I've seen him 20 times first, he had number 212 at the end of the corridor, then he kept moving towards the front now. He's next door number 202 the room clerk threw up his hands. You're crazy. He exclaimed and I saw that he meant what he said. I shut up at once and dismissed him after he had gone. I heard him rattling the knob on the pale man's door. There's no doubt that he believes the room to be empty. Thus it is all that I could now.  Understand the events of the past few weeks. I now comprehended the significance of the death and number 207 I even feel partly responsible for the old ladies passing after all I brought the Pale Man with me here, but it was not I who fixed his path why he chose to approach me room after room through the length of this dreary Hotel why his path crossed the threshold of the woman in number 207 those Mysteries I cannot explain.  I should have I suppose I should have guessed his identity when he skipped the three rooms the night. I fell unconscious upon the floor in a single night of Triumph. He Advanced until he was almost to my door. He will be coming by and by to inhabit this room his ultimate goal when he comes I shall at least be able to return his smile of grim recognition. Meanwhile, I have only to wait beyond my bolted.  or  The sound yeah effect where you think was it spooky? Yeah. No. No, I don't think so. Like somebody painted themself with white me go. It gave me goosebumps, right? Who do you think the Pale Man was a murderer?  A ghost that a murderer that died. That is Ghost. I think he was a grim reaper do what do you think of that? Does that make sense? Yeah, I gotta agree. It does kind of make sense with the old lady dying. Yeah, right. Yeah, and it's the Grim Reaper was like following him on the train to the hotel because he was going to reap the main character Soul, you know, I mean, yeah, maybe you'll even make sense.  Maybe they have a cloak for one thing. He didn't say what he was wearing. It just said he was pale. Yeah, and I doubt he was naked and I doubt that. He was actually wearing a cloak because he might want to like blend in. Well, that's true. Yeah people wearing a black dark hat. Yeah, and I haven't been wearing a tuxedo. Maybe I don't know.  Dark, I don't know if you saw someone in a dark tuxedo and a top hat. I think they would stand out. No, no off the top. This was like wait wasn't this written in the 19 1934. So I think it's about that time. That would really stand out. I don't know you don't think so. No. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. He doesn't have a  Past I think he has like one of those sun hats after the way black. Hmm. I imagine him having like a hat that's like never stole a black hat like one of those classic hats but a classic one of ya attacker 100. Hmm. All right, shall we wrap up appeal? Shall we wrap up the Pale Man? Mmm, how many stars would you give it out of five?  Maybe for it was pretty good Friday, five to two out of five, aren't there we go. Wrap it up. Good night.
Welcome to the official podcast of FCS fans Nation with your host Skylar Neil Matthew crazy and Lawrence Smith.  It has been 10 days since the FCS faithful have descended upon Frisco, Texas and now everybody is at home still probably sleeping off some hangovers getting over some sleepless nights and an enjoyable amazing time down in Frisco, Texas ladies and gentlemen this morning afternoon or evening. Welcome to the finale episode of  Season 3 of the FCS football fans Nation Podcast Skylar Neil Lauren Smith myself Matthew Frazee all three on board tonight to finish off what has been a phenomenal season of the podcast the page and football in general guys. Once again got the video chat rolling. Our beautiful faces are up on the screen should be a wonderful podcast for our listeners Kyler. It's been 10 days. Are you fully recovered my friend from an  Ending weekend. I am so depressed right now. It's been 10 days and there's no college football. It's just so weird feeling I've ever had in my life. I'm already ready for this next season. Absolutely. Well, we have the crappy Pro Bowl to look forward to on Sunday. So I guess solid that's that's a silver lining and Lawrence. Are you fully recovered now with some new background behind you in comparison to the last time we had a video chat. Yeah typically in the past.  When we've done these podcasts, I've had to record it and then go straight to bed because you know, we're recording at like 10 o'clock my time, but you know, I've got plenty of evening left tonight after we get finished here out here in Washington state. So looking forward to that a change of scenery. And now we plan for the central Time start the Central and Pacific start times for our podcast instead of Central and Eastern. So yeah, we are excited to have you  Guys, we're going to catch three different sections tonight. We are going to catch on of our Frisco recap answer our FCS football fans Nation questions about the game what we saw we're also going to get an answer all the questions about recapping our trip. We had a lot of interest in terms of what we were doing as admins and already if you are sick and tired of the matchup of the bizon and Dukes. We are doing some way too early 2020 questions to get you excited about all 126 or 125 roughly teens  Depending on who is official for next year. All right, guys, let's kick right into it Kyler. We'll start with you man. Since you are the solo fan here. That was one of the many randoms we saw that wasn't a bison or Duke. So kind of just talk about the game in general what you saw from both teams. And and what's kind of your recap thoughts throughout the game. What do you think man? Yeah, this this was a great teacher great game between two evenly matched teams. I think anyone who is watching game could really say,  That I mean JMU had an opportunity to tie it on the last Drive, which is always a type of game. You're hoping to watch when when a team is in a blowout and at the very end of the game they have an opportunity to tie it of course, there's an interception and if NDSU random back the score would have actually looked a lot like the Eastern game last year, but this game no doubt about it was even closer than that last year's game. Yeah. I mean it was a phenomenal game. I was kind of confused why JMU when they knew Trail ants really wasn't  Throwing very well on third Downs why they didn't decide to spy him a little that was a weird game play and I saw or I didn't see actually but who knows? I'm not a coach. I am a keyboard, you know armchair quarterback, I guess you can say but overall man. It was it was a great game to watch really competitive to Great fan bases and I was sitting in a great section with some great people. So I was overall happy awesome man Lawrence. What are your takeaways just from your thoughts throughout the game how it played out?  Just an overall view my friend. Do you remember what I was telling you on Jamie's first drive of the game. I I don't recall. I recall watching it going. Wow, that was way too easy. But I remember our conversation. You said, you know, how often does that happen? Well, my the point that I was making that drive was  If JMU is going to get 6 yards of Rush every time they run the ball. This is going to be a very long day for NDSU.  Absolutely. I was very confident at kickoff and I was even more confident when it was 7 to nothing.  And then everything changed but overall it was a great game. I agree with Kyler. I don't know why JMU didn't focus on stopping tray running the ball a little bit. More my other big question about the the game plan was if you've got the ball in the 3-yard line and have a timeout in your back pocket. Why would you not run the ball instead of throwing it to to the pylon?  But as football fans, I don't think we could have asked for a better game. I think it was one of the best championships we've seen in the last decade or so and as much as it pains me that my team didn't come out on top. I was just equally as happy for you to give you that big congratulatory hug at the end of the game and hope hope next season and next year's game ends up just the same as as this year in terms of how well the game.  It really was the matchup that people had anticipated and you know, it kind of played out regardless of winner or loser how we thought which would be it's going to be a heck of a matchup and what else should we expect? We're now if you could look at the last three matchups between these two teams 62 to 60 is you know in favor of NDSU by two points, which doesn't you know mean much but 6260 is the score between these two in the last three games. I mean, how crazy is that?  It's just been three basically epic games. It really is unreal. My thought process is I watched the game unfold after that first drive. I looked at Lawrence and I looked at got on and said well that was too easy and you know, if plays out the rest of the game like this NDSU is going to get absolutely cream. I also had to sell a feeling of confidence knowing that NDSU was a very good adjusting team. I thought James Madison should have stuck with that run more a little bit more ball control. I once again,  Armchair quarterback and Dylan Stapleton to me seemed Unstoppable. It seemed like every time the ball went his way. The there was just no Aaron Mark Adele or you know, one of our linebackers just couldn't keep up with him. He was just kind of a mismatch and overall. It was just so back and forth like NDSU got the 21-6 lead or something, but it didn't stay that way in the new a team wasn't just going to pull away or blow it out. It was overall just a really good game. I want to go into a more but some of the questions that are  Fans have asked guys are going to kind of guide that conversation. So I'm going to save some of our opinions. I know we all have done that for this next part. So let's Dive Right into our fans questions guys, and we're going to hop in right away in the pregame podcast Mike Schnell ask this you said it was mentioned at NDSU could pass but not run against JMU what made that change? Why did NDSU think that keeping the ball in the hands of Lance and keeping him on the ground was their best only option to be JMU. I actually just  have the answer Mike from the postgame Conference of Matt Entz. He was asked that same question. He said I believe is Ra's al Ghul mm advisor report. I asked him. How come in a season where literally your averages were probably 30 to 35 runs a game for your running backs and tray ran about 10 times a game was it flipped today with 30 runs for Trey Lance and 10 for the running backs and Mad Ants just said, we watched 15 games of film on James Madison. We felt like they had it played a lot of  Teams with mobile quarterbacks. We thought their run defense was Stout. So we chose the mobile quarterback route over the running backs now trade lines obviously ran on some broken passes so that probably increased the number of Mike but overall, it sounded like NDSU basically said, there's no way we're running on this run defense because it's so Elite and I think besides Ty Brooks getting what 13 yards on one run that he had to like fight for I think besides that are running backs. I don't know if anybody got over four yards besides that  so it was all tray in the ground. It sounded like NDSU is willing to risk it from that standpoint. So Lawrence, I'll ask you this one man from Chris Hammond our good friend. Obviously, we spent some time with down there was Dylan Stapleton underutilized by JM you he seemed Unstoppable and they look that way. What did you think about the game plan with using Dylan as a tight end in comparison to the rest of the games that throughout the season Dylan actually got  Pretty comparable amounts of work as he had in each of the regular season games. If not, even a little bit more action. He was kind of in the regular season and beginning of the playoffs. He was that guy that you would go to sort of once you got inside the RedZone. Not necessarily the guy you'd throw the ball to on your own 20. I do think Jamie. You probably could have dialed up a couple more tight end plays but  You know, it really wasn't the the bread-and-butter that they'd been going with for most of the Season which had been successful for us. And another thing you have to consider is that if they just start throwing to Dillon every time then NDSU knows what's coming. I think Jamie was trying to stick to the game plan and continue doing what had been successful in what had gotten them that far. Yeah. He definitely looked really good on those past plays in terms of like, oh my goodness.  They just can't stop this guy, but you're not going to feed it to one individual the entire time for sure Kyler. How did you see ndsu's game plan in terms of running with the quarterback quite a bit and jmu's in terms of how they were executed on offense. So I wish I was on the last podcast before my computer crashed because I would have acts in I mean I've told you this mat quite a bit throughout the season I was actually not impressed with ndsu's passing game and I actually had the opposite reaction of what you guys said in the podcast I said if they would be  Successful, they would actually have to run now. Did I anticipate it being trained Lance running that much? No, but like like we all said Jay Mewes run defense is Elite. So that was a great strategy great game planning and a lot of it was, you know rpos where he was looking for a pass or I guess not even an RPO, but it was in a spread formation where it was option to run or the option to pass and not a lot of not a lot of ride receivers were open or he was overthrowing a little bit.  And you could tell he's been he saw a hole here and I think that was a smart game plan because you need to fight for every single yard you can against JMU. So if you see a hole with six yards take it and that's what they did for Dylan Stapleton. Yeah, I mean all agree with Lawrence because honestly, I watch a lot of FCS games throughout the year, but I don't have flow Sports. So I actually didn't get to watch a lot of CA all I was was tracking the stats for a CA games.  Because flow Sports is stupid. I wish it was either on ESPN Plus or you know, even Pluto at least that's a free app. I'm not going to pay for flow Sports. So just by the stats, I mean Dylan had a great game. He did look Unstoppable at times. Maybe they should have utilized him more but if they started utilizing him or he would have been covered more and then maybe some of those open plays were going to be as open as you know, they were sent to use only in single coverage the Stapleton Brothers man. They were they were having a hell of a games and at times it  Unstoppable, but overall I think both teams had great game plans on offense. The only thing that I would have liked to judge is or see A Change Would have been JMU when Trey Lance is running all over them just spy, which I said in the beginning of the podcast at least see if that works if it doesn't work because trade Lance was be seeing over people and running over people then he at least know even the spies not working, but I would have liked to see a change in at least see how that could have adapted for maybe a couple series.  Yeah would have been interesting. I wonder if Matt ends and I didn't watch I would have to watch 15 games like they did but they I'm Jay Mewes defensive line being so good. I'm guessing a lot of quarterbacks. You didn't even need a spy because L defensive ends and defensive tackles. Probably just contain quarterback so well and then you know, and as you probably just said hey if they don't leave a spy just go for it, man. And that's going to be my assumption. There are a couple things from me on that. I'm not sure JMU used to spy a single.  Down this entire season and even if they did Tray with so elusive, he broke so many tackles. Yeah, I think Rondell Carter and John Dhaka had him, you know in any other game against any other quarterback, you know, they would have had four five or six acts even and correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Trey got sacked a single time. He broke so many tackles. I'm not sure putting a spy on him would have it might have limited the  words that he gained but I've I don't think it even that would have contained them for very long  I think that was it's probably the biggest compliment in we don't want this be a trail and show but that was the biggest thing that NDSU fans saw them all year was when pressure would collapse. It wasn't the guy kind of young player that ducks his head down and just tries to find an escape. He just works within what is breaking down and then make something happen. It wasn't just like I got to get out of this it was okay. Here's my next, you know something you expect from a senior so pretty crazy stuff. I hate to break it to the rest of the  yes, but it's going to be the trail and show not just today but for the next three years.  And everybody's chanting transfer transfer except I've ever had for Kansas State needs a quarterback. I hear Fargo's nightmare. The FCS is dream. But on the you know Tre Lance having some wow plays kind of leads us into Jamie Williams questions guys, and I guess I'll start it off. What was each of your wow plays from the Nati and for me it hate to stick on the narrative, but it would have to be trained.  It's his run on that third and 23 because our seats were Row 3 in that end zone and actually if you watch ndsu's hype video at the end to like recap the game you can see us for in that moment when Trail runs it in. So it's like he was running right at us and it was third and 23 and yes, there was a hold JMU Twitter. I understand but that play was just so like I expected him to you know, maybe gained seven yards probably punch, but then you scored a touchdown. It was right in front of us. So that was my wow.  Now I just I couldn't believe that and I think I did the Cam Newton Superman thing. It was cool. So Kyler. What about you man? Did you have a wow moment from that game? Honestly, it was kind of the same thing Eastern did to you guys last year in the thick of it. They will go for a fake field goal. I was not expecting that and I thought that was you know, that's probably something we wouldn't have seen with any of the last coaches at NDSU had so preparing for that. I mean it was executed perfectly and I think that was a big momentum shift.  Inside the game. But yeah, I mean overall every single time Trail and was breaking a tackle was a wow moment. To be honest. Do you love what do you got there buddy? I think you guys chose the the two plays that probably 95% of people that watch the game would choose and I think the cool thing is like you mentioned from where our seats were we had pretty phenomenal views of both of those plays because on the trail and to run coming straight towards us.  Of course, we had a great view of that one. But on the the fake field goal. We kind of had the perfect sight line to see the the whole that he ended up breaking through to score the touchdown. We had pretty good view of that from our seats even those you know, 70 yards away from us and then you gotta you got to mention the interception at the end. I the player who picked the ball off. I'm sorry His Name Escapes Me In This Moment and you can remind me.  The most incredible thing that I heard though, it was listening to the hero Sports podcast earlier this week. They are saying that in an interview that player said that he completely left his man that he was supposed to be marking on that play because he just had a gut feeling that dinucci was going to go to Brandon poke on that play. And I mean, of course an interception on the goal line with three seconds left in the game is going to be the deciding factor.  But man that what a way to end the game as a you know, as a JMU fan I was disappointed of course, but one of the first thoughts of Pops in my head was like damn that is a hell of a way to end a championship game. I don't think you could draw up anything more exciting than than that. That's what that's what we did first Towson back in the semifinal game. That's how we lost Vernon Adams threw that interception. We're like, ah crap.  It sucks, but at the same time like you said it is a hell of a way to end the game when you look back at it. I'm just glad he didn't run it back for the pysics because he had nothing but green grass in front of him yet this squirrel done, you know, that's an Easton stick move to run it instead of slide and count the clock down. Yeah is in the score would have looked just like Easterns last year.  Yep. Yeah, that's mr. James Hendricks and I'll get on a soap opera about him for a little bit because I think it's worthy. He comes to NDSU recruited as a quarterback. And after a season or two is not seeing the field obviously and goes to the coaching staff and tells them I want to get on this field somehow and they say alright, we'll try you out on the defensive side. See what you do kills it at the safety position becomes a starter. So we've been calling him Jimmy football at NDSU.  Because you know, he's got the mind of a quarterback, but he's playing at safety. So he said that he saw them run in the post game that he saw the JMU run that play against the semi-final against Weber and then they ran it earlier dinucci overthrew the running back who you know had a step on the corner you guys are in that same play away from our seats earlier in the game and Hendrix felt like that's the way it was going to go. So I got a selfless guy who just wanted to get on the field and they  Ask him in the post game press conference. You know, which play will you remember Mark? Will you remember that fake field goal because he was the one around the fake field goal in or the interception and he said going on stage with the 14 seniors and all the other guys getting on stage with the confetti is that was our goal. So that's what I'm going to remember more than anyplace. Oh, I love I just love that from players. So I think that's really cool guys. How big of an advantage to players from NDSU in JM you get having that extra practice time in the playoffs in winter.  Camp just right before the championship game male gaede wants to know this especially for like those younger classmen. How much value does that play in in terms of those extra reps? I heard Madden's talk about it a little bit about how those younger classmen now get so much extra practice time. Not only for Frisco but for next season, so that's got to be a pretty valuable thing. Kyler especially had some eagles with some depth plane last year in Frisco. What do you think about those extra weeks for those guys? Obviously meant nothing.  Oh, man, I didn't set you up. No. No, I think it does mean something though and it gives maybe not the extra practice because guess what there's a long offseason and you still have to retrain yourself to refocus. You know, it's like when you come back from summer break everyone is still a little scrambled even if you took a month of summer school, you're still not the same but what it does give is it gives those players something to play for next year, you know, they've been there they have something to look forward to they want to prove that they can go back.  Back, so in terms of practicing and get ready for the next season. No bit in terms of look at what we can accomplish in potentially accomplish again, or if you're the losing team. Look what you want to do again. You want to prove that this wasn't a fluke. I think for more the mentality that that's where really can help a team instead of you know, oh does the practice help help someone to prepare for the next season? No, but the mentality of being in the championship game from being, you know, prepping for that championship game. You want that feeling back and  Going to help you fight for it next year.  Awesome stuff guys question here from care to the we're going to move into our own trip will go down the Hot Topic which has flooded our page. She wants to know if players are coached on how to handle press conferences. And if don't do they should they receive coaching? Obviously, she's talking a little bit about bending new cheese comments, which some most I think would say they don't care about it seems to be mostly NDSU fans who are really upset about it Lawrence unleash a little bit Bud. Tell tell me what you think about.  The postgame press conference which continues to flood our page with with the overused comments or let us hear Look What been dinucci said is if you asked him again ten minutes later, he wouldn't have said the same thing. You gotta remember that. This kid just came off of the highest to lowest emotional roller coaster of his life. Yeah. They thought they were about to punch it into potentially tie going to overtime in the national championship game.  Mmmmm, and then in an instant, it's all over our seats were right next to the JMU entrance to the field and been dinucci came over in tears shook. Every player's hand to walk past him gave out so many hugs and then after NDSU Neil the ball  And players started to rush the field. He was even shaking hands with.  NDSU fans that were approaching him the fact that we're going to take these young men that have just been on that emotional roller coaster there at the lowest point of their, you know football careers and we're going to stick microphones in front of them before they even have a chance to go to the locker room and kind of decompress and debrief with their coaches I'd and I just think we have major Gall as fans to judge what comes out of their mouths in that moment.  Because you know what, if you know, like let's imagine you got fired from your job or something and like as you're walking out of the building you've got reporters in your face asking you about your job performance, like you're probably going to say something stupid but, you know, give them give them half an hour, you know, let the let the winning team do interviews first. Let the the team that comes out on, you know on the wrong end have time with their coaches with their teammates to  Decompress talk things over, you know, yeah. He said something stupid, but you know  He's a young man and you know the he'll learn from it. And you know, let's move on. It's not a big deal.  I don't really have any other differentiate opinion from that. I didn't see I been dinucci because I you know, I was I was going on the field but you guys told me about that afterwards, but you may call that ran right? That's really well said yeah, I was I was helping my brother's father-in-law he was he was going to wait for the stairs to get down there. And I said no, I was in the Marine Corps come over the wall. I will buddy care you and I basically just I grabbed them down and brought him down on the field. So we're going to war here, buddy.  Um, very well said Lawrence well said Kyler just some opinion on those comments and things. Well, yeah, I mean for one, he's a senior he was playing the game of his life championship game most likely because I don't know Ben dinucci getting really any draft feedback. Like I haven't seen anything. Maybe maybe that will change maybe he can get sign undrafted free agent, but I really haven't seen any NFL hype behind him. So most likely it's his last game of his career. He's never playing football. Again. This is a person who has worked as hard.  Whole life to get to this National stage like this is what you dream of as a football player as a quarterback and you dream of the opportunity when you're a kid throwing the game-winning touchdown and instead you through the game losing play. Yeah. I mean come on your emotions are high look at every single not every single but there's a lot of professional athletes who after interviews they interview and they say some stupid stuff. This isn't just a all words. This is a JMU thing. They don't carry themselves, right? Guess what? It's an  Little guy. He just lost the game for J. Mu and the biggest game of his career. Potentially the last game of his career and it happens throughout all of sports through any level even professionals still do this. It's not anything bad in people are people are way too upset about this. They said the last same thing last year when Aaron best didn't praise NDSU after he said I failed the team I lost the team and do you remember everyone on our page started saying Aaron best is an awful person. He should be saying how great NDSU is know. They were asking him questions.  About his team and his coaching, you know, they asked Ben dinucci what his opinions were everyone gets an opinion there people are dragging away to out of proportion.  All I have to say is if you hated it and clearly the comments were great. But we understand the emotional state watch been to New cheese interviews before the frisco game, which I did and every time I watched him I go damn it. Now, I gotta like this guy because everything he said was you know, it was nice and complimentary. It was professional. Everything was good because he wasn't in the worst emotional state in his life. Yeah. So I think you know, you're going to you're going to hear things in those moments no matter what  Like Lord said we got to put ourselves in those positions and you never know how you're going to act until you actually are so that kind of Recaps most of the questions about the game guys. I encourage you to listen to all the other podcasts are on the FCS if you want more in-depth stuff, but we are moving onto a bunch of questions from our fans about our trip. So Gentlemen, let's jump right into this first off. We have a shout out from he'll Wilson Q Wilson showed up to our hero Sports FCS football.  Fans Nation tailgate he said this is not a question, but I just wanted to say it was awesome to finally meet up with you admins. See you guys next year. Cheers Gail is great to meet you man. It was awesome to talk about the game before it was snowing. It was cold. It was wet, but I'm glad we got to meet up with you bud. All right, gentlemen, Adam Willie fan-favorite wants to know what was your favorite part of Frisco, Texas. So favorite parts of Frisco guys. Mine. I have to I'll say my first one to let you guys go.  Going out into enemy territory. I said it so many times. I don't want to go to the bizon bars. I've been there are tons of time. Let's go over the James Madison fans are let's go where the randomness is and I want to be the minority in this Friday night activity clearly storming the field and all that's an easy cop-out but it was awesome to go to James Madison's bars meet their fans have beers with them drink with them before the game because it was cool to just see a whole different culture and guess what just like I complimented Eastern fans last year same.  Thing with JMU fans. Wow, really nice people. They love to have beers. They like to hang out. So that was my my one of my two, but I'll let you guys go at it a little bit Lawrence. What was your favorite part of Frisco there my friend. I enjoyed absolutely demolishing Kyler and Madden tell him how many plays Iran irrelevant. What was the final score?  It was pretty bad. No, I enjoy the entire weekend. This is quickly become one of my favorite Traditions being down there with you guys and it's something that I hope we can look forward to for many years to come.  Absolutely Kyler. What's your favorite part there buddy? Besides getting destroyed and matted and destroy me in the UFC fighting game. It was leaving because I hate all of you know, man. There's just a good time hanging out with everyone. I will say the NDSU tailgate so we didn't really go see I was kind of bummed at how they've split up JMU completely at least in the parking lots. Like I didn't see one JMU fan throughout the whole tailgate besides the Lawrence and  Other people who came to us, but then DC your tailgating man. It's a good time. There's a lot of people there and seeing that Wofford fan with one tooth. That was pretty awesome. Yeah that tooth has a blanket ban that tooth has a name. I love that dude. He was he had such a good energy. He's he's excited. He was happy and he was a good he was a good guy anyone if anyone could track down this Wofford fan, let him know that we want them to be an admin.  Yeah, bring the Wofford fan on and all that does cover what I Kris Hammonds questions in the section, which was the story of the mythical Wofford fan. We're not sure if he was real like he was kind of dressed like a genie like he had gold and like these puffy black pants, but he was on ESPN there's evidence. Yeah you and I showed him as quickly as he can see so he vanished. Yeah, I'm great seats the Wofford fan amazing stuff.  Guys, which one of the admins suffered from the frisco cold and snow the worst Steve monkey dick wants to know who suffered from the worst. I think I honestly think it's myself but I think I have an excuse for it unless you guys disagree because I'm a I'm a tactical smart cold person now from being from North Dakota, so I'm like, okay. I know how many times I need to get back into the car to reheat the feet.  But I also hate the cold. I don't care that I'm from North Dakota. I'm a week. I'm a week one. I had to jump in the car a bunch of times. So I don't know if you guys have a different vote, but I was in that car a lot. I don't really think I would say I probably  Sorry, you can go I don't really think any of us suffered all that bad. But you know, if you're going to bite the bullet like that. Yeah, I'll vote for you, too.  I'm not and I would say yeah, I definitely probably suffered the most but didn't show it for one. I was wearing very breathable shoes. So I just was not well prepared. So but I was also the guy who did not go into my car really at all. It was once I was there I was like, all right, let's go, you know, even when we were tailgating on the North Dakota side you guys left to go warm up, and I said, nope. I'm staying here with these guys. So I was probably in the worst shape, but but yeah, Matthew  Popped out the easiest Ohio hundred percent dead. So I've been to a few cold Frisco games and I was just like I'm not gonna deal with being cold during the game. So yeah, I Steve I definitely take the hit for that 100% but it was it was a crazy weather day. We pulled up at 7 a.m. And it was snowing and rated it's sleeting and we had this big plan for this big tailgate and man. It was unbelievable. I could not believe that whether then  sunny at halftime.  Crazy stuff I Chris Hammond also wants to know guys. What was the favorite tailgate spot? You saw I think this one's pretty obvious Kyler. You want to talk about the best tailgate spot that we saw it was definitely our tailgate. Yeah, right. Yeah, we canceled that at like 6 a.m. Because we didn't want to tailgate in her own spot. We're like not too cold know that that bison are well the whole by some section is pretty awesome. Let's be real.  But though that area where they have all the trophies and it's all filled with, you know alcohol and you know, you just donate to them and you can fill up your glasses many times as you want. That is pretty freaking sweet. But literally the whole bison lat. I mean you guys just tailgate like no one else in the FCS. It's awesome. And I love it. It is it is a ton of fun, and I'm I'm already looking forward to it next year and for a warm one in September.  Will be really nice. I was unaware of this story and Lawrence you were closer to Chris Hammond during this is ham and acceptable addition to a frosty Brew. What is this story to this ham in the beard thing. This guy's if you're listening to the podcast this stems from we were in our seats during the game and there's been comments on the page about ham and beer. What is this about? Well this the person most able to answer this question.  Is ham and acceptable addition to a frosty Brew would be Chris Hammond himself. So the story is Chris was simultaneously trying to hold his beer while eating a breakfast burrito.  And one of the little cubes of ham fell in the bottom of his beer and despite his various attempts at getting it out. He finished his beer with that little Cuba ham still in there. Of course, I didn't taste his hand bear, but he it didn't seem to slow him down at all. So I'm going to have to say with you know, like secondhand knowledge. Yes, ham is apparently  An acceptable addition to a frosty Brew but Chris will have to get back to whatever you guys ever had one breakfast beer. Have you guys ever had a breakfast beer because man beer in the morning with eggs and ham is delicious. Yeah, but do you put the ham and eggs inside the beer?  Hey, once you consume it all goes to the same place anyway.  I mean, I guess we had some from The Mont, uh keys to the way too strong Kyler shots. It was a good weekend of drinking and we had some great drinks bought from us. Shout out to any of us who's listening to this. We had a few JMU fan sale of the podcast. You guys are awesome. We appreciated the drinks and all the stuff when we went out and about it was cool to just just meet FCS fans in general guys. It really was a blast and the last Frisco recap.  Pizza or Burgers Brandon Anderson asks and we can all give our personal opinion. I'm definitely going to go Pizza over burgers and as a personal opinion, but we ate a lot of rubies barbecue and there ain't no shame in our game. We met up with the hero Sports guys. We went we went route. We went Rudy's Barbecue pretty hard guys. So I don't know if we actually had a pizza Burgers but on a personal level, I'm all Pizza Lawrence. Are you a pizza or Burger guy from? Mr. Brandon Anderson eyepiece up pretty frequently.  Lee and for that reason I'm going to say Burgers because when I have a burger, I have a good burger, so I just my general like my average Burger score is higher than my average Pizza score.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hold up question. So it's not a Midwest thing going east coast, which is Virginia. Obviously where your current home. That's the first time I heard.  Like you go get a burger and they say how do you want it done? And I was like what don't you just cook Hamburger? So my question ever heard that okay, so that's that's that's that's an everywhere. But North Dakota's I was raised in a house where burgers are cooked done because  Because the meat is ground up unlike a steak where the bacteria resides on the outside and so you can you can get away with cooking a steak medium rare.  Burgers are yeah, I think technically you're supposed to cook a burger the entire way through you can kind of get away with it more if you know you're familiar with the meat and or handling it yourself. So when I go to a restaurant, I don't order a burger anything less than medium. Well almost well done. Just because you know, I'm not I'm not a food poisoning or salmonella kind of guy. So if I'm cooking them at home, you know, I might back off a little bit.  And leave it a tad bit pink, but no save the save the medium for for your steak medium rare.  I was curious about that because now you'll be West Coast and apparently Kyler you can confirm that West Coast is the same way. Yeah, I've always had people ask how do you want your Burgers cooked and I always say, you know for burgers, you know, I don't go medium rare like my steak but I say medium I like it pink in there. Gosh, you guys don't like to live? Yeah. No, I do like to live. That's the problem.  Well join us join us next time guys on the thank you so much for listening to the food and tailgate podcast join us. Next time. We will be discussing chicken and grass-fed beef so know how do you like your chicken cooked?  Oh my goodness. We got off track. But hey guys, we are willing to answer every question on the FCS football fans Nation Podcast. We have made that a staple of what we do. Thank you Brandon for getting us on an enjoyable topic. Hope you had some laughs and guys. Thank you so much to the Dukes into the bizon great game epic stuff will cover a little bit more at the end. But right now there are plenty of fans who were sick of the purple and yellow and the green and yellow of NDSU.  You they want to know about their teams in 2020. So we are going to go way way too early 2020 to end our podcast tonight and we're going to start with one of our backups one of our amazing Sixth Man of the Year. Brandon Owens who stepped up on our podcast this year. He said Jacksonville State has signed some pretty big guys in their off season. I think they got another three star transfer commit today. He says he has confirmation from one of the players that the culture is beginning to shift at Jacksonville State if all of this continues,  To happen. Could we see JSU back at the top of the ovc and back into that top 10 range? So are we going to be able to see a Jackson will stay bounce back or are we going to be able to see kind of what we've seen before and if that confirmation is correct Brandon, I would say yes. We'll see Jacksonville State back into the playoff mix. I don't know about on top of the ovc because I think like Kyler's pointed out many times that obese. He's actually getting a lot better not just one team up on top.  But that culture has to be fixed. I mean and it the strategy seems to be the same. We're seeing some really talented 3 to 4 star guys transferring in but how will they gel on the football field at all that and I don't think that's something myself or any of us could answer until we actually see it and that's up to your coach which I've seen him taking a lot of heat on Twitter from JSU fans about you know, this isn't the guy I've seen clown memes and things like that, you know, we will see  If that culture actually gets shifted into you got to be here for the Gamecocks be here for the victory or if it's just people coming to their to find a place to play. So Kyler. What do you think? I'm your team actually play Jacksonville State this year. What are your opinions? Well, I'm not going to buy into what this one player said that the cultures change. I think that's just what every player is going to say when they have a Down Season and people are judging the culture that's in the program. Of course a players going to say that know we're starting to change because a player wants to have faith in his team, but at the end of the  Day, am I going to completely count-out JSU? Because they had one down near the last six years of being in the ovc where they dominated absolutely not this I'll take my odds. I'll pick JSU in the ovc over anyone just because they've dominated the last five to six years in JSU as every they have the talent. They have the facilities. They have everything going for them to be a top 10 Team every single year. So yeah make a couple changes JSU in my opinion. I believe they're probably going to be back at the  Top of the ovc. They most likely will be a top-10 caliber team towards the end of the year, but I'm not going to put them in the top 10 to begin the year. But yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna believe it. JSU will be the team to beat in the ovc this next coming year.  There you go. Brandon Lawrence. Can you you know bounce them to that question if you want as well, but kind of continue on into J films question as well, which is Will Jacksonville State have a bounce-back year while their coach get fired. How do we see gisu JSU playing out and I apologize. If I butchered your last name, like every podcast know that I also know I'm messing up and I'm also not proud of it. So Jay Jay wants to know Lawrence. What do you think about Jacksonville State next season?  Well, Jacksonville State better have a bounce-back your or yes, I think coach cross will be on the hot seat. In fact, I think he's already on the hot seat if they don't make the playoffs next year. I think he's out. I think Jacksonville State had their fans their you know, their athletics department has come to have certain expectations. We can sit here and debate.  Eight as the FCS is a whole if those expectations are valid but their program that I believe thinks that they should be in the quarterfinals every season and if grass isn't getting that done, I think this is going to be his prove it year and if they don't have a bounce back here, yes, I think who you will get the can.  Big stuff for the Gamecocks coming up in 2020 guys 2020. So Brandon will see how the Gamecocks play out for you and Jay will see if bounce back here or if we see a coach getting fired. All right guys, Matt style actually has a really good question here. Now. This is really early Maps. You got to work with us. We may not know everything right off the bat and this is going to be quite the stretch, but of the teams who broke out into the playoffs see Sacramento State,  P Monmouth, who do you think will build off of last year's performance and who do you think will be one hit wonders. He says a historical contrast would be 2017 Weaver State and 2018 main pretty good math there. I like that a lot. So he's using like the Sacramento State's Austin fees The Mamas who in the playoffs this year who had a pretty good run is going to build off that momentum and become better. And whose one hit wondered. I'll let you guys go first.  Cuz I'm probably going to steal somebody so Kyler. What do you think there buddy?  Well, when I look at who's going to be building off it I look at what they've done the last couple of years and if they steadily kept improving year after year, then I think you have a good shot. I'm going to actually look at Austin Peay for that. You know, they had what how many years of not even winning the game and then they started win a couple games then they had a 500 over 500 season and now they made the playoffs. They made a splash that program seems to be doing everything the correct way. I think Sac State will regress a  Bit year over year, I believe in their coaching but the players that they're losing I think is going to hurt them more than what Austin Peay is losing. So I'm going to take the program that is slowly steadily in you know, improved each year kind of like what Weber has done every single year. They've been able to get better and better. I'll pick Austin Peay for now out of those couple.  Lawrence what do you think those couple and any other teams on the field that you can think of is it cheating to choose Montana? No, it's not because that's why I didn't answer first because I knew I would be stealing something from somebody. So go ahead buddy. Yeah, so I see Monmouth listed here. I don't think Monmouth is gonna even make the playoffs next year, especially now that their stud running back Pete Guerrero is declaring for the NFL draft.  Early and they're done. But yeah Montana I think you know people are going to say that that's kind of a cop-out but they hadn't been in the playoffs and in a few years and you know, they're starting to be some questions surrounding that program.  I think they're headed in the right direction. They will all but likely be better next year than they were this year and that's kind of a scary thought for the Big Sky because Montana was pretty good this year Dalton Steve's gone.  Why do you know is that a is that to their detriment? And is that going to make them better? Nah, they'll struggle a couple more games.  They'll still be good though. I do like your pick Montana there. They'll continue to improve. I don't think we're going to see, you know, three years in a row of not having Montana in the playoffs anytime soon. I think both Montana speakers are setting themselves up nicely to become regular contenders.  Totally agree with you and guys I'm gonna go with Alba knee just because of the under coupler or you know, Jeff under coupler that freshman quarterback. Yes. I love it throwing it back to wrestling days. If you got a stud freshman quarterback like that. That's something you can build off of continue to bring in people into the program get boosters excited. So I'm not saying Albanese gonna start in become some see a power hours.  I think as long as he's there they're gonna have opportunities to win. So. Alright guys, I promise you this there will be a purple and yellow wearing purple and gold see a team next year. That's pretty good. I don't know if it'll be Albany but there will be books. Hello. Duke dog guys are fearless leader. Wyatt cook has a question for us. You want some penguins on the Missouri State Higher of Petrino. So basic breakdown for me why it is I don't care. How bad  Our program is struggling. I'm not a fan of hiring people who have had those sort of issues in the past bringing someone who's going to be good for the culture and start something fresh and new the way Austin Peay brought in there guy after so many bad years and now he's crushing it with Charlotte with the Ford. They the 49ers. I think they are. So I like to bring in a guy who can establish something in a brand new culture not something that may have been broken in the past. Fool me once you no shame on you fool me twice shame on me. We'll see if Missouri State  Actually pays out for them. I haven't seen Missouri State really be competitive in their time here in the Missouri Valley. So we'll see how it plays out for him. I don't like the higher their why Kyle are you like the hire a Petrino there at Missouri State?  Yeah, I mean overall that's been a crap program. They need some change. They need to culture change and you know, what at the end of the day Bobby Petrino knows how to coach he you might not like who he is as a person. He's a winner. He's been a winner and everywhere. He's gone. His career record is a hundred nineteen to 56 and every single program. He's had you know in all of his head coaching. He's only had one losing season. It was a Arkansas 2008 Razorbacks were here.  Five and six and then the next couple years. He went eight and five ten and 311 and to he is a proven coach. He's gonna make Missouri Valley or Missouri State better than they were absolutely because they have been trash. So yeah, I mean overall you're playing football and you're going you want to win games Bobby Petrino if you hate him. Oh, well people hate Bobby how to but he's a great coach and he knows how to win. It's a good it's a good hire.  All right. We'll see you no morals and football. Sometimes things have to cross a certain line guys. We need to run into a speed round now because we're running out of time here for our podcast, but that's okay. We're right on track where we thought we'd be so mr. Joshua Hoffman. I'm going to take your question right off the bat who is the sophomore younger returning this year not named Trey lamps and the second one. Who's the best second year head coach not named Matt and hence our Curt cignetti.  Those are both dumbly obvious answers to both questions. So I didn't get a chance look much into the coaches for you Joshua, but I looked into the players shout out to Hero Sports and they're all freshmen first team offense that they put out there. I looked up first team defense as well. But I'm going to have to go from going through that list and just checking statistics and looking at size things like that. Tyler Hudson. He is a six 285-pound wide receiver who is a freshman last year as a freshman last year.  Out of the Southland 55 catches 975 yards and 12 touchdowns. Where's number 88 Michael Irvin shout out so big stuff. I think for Tyler Hudson watch for his name to continue to blow up the staff sheets for you see a down there for breaking out as a young freshman guys. We met Halle Jones the night at the James Madison bars of Friday evening before the game kicked off all it was great to see you great talking FCS football with you, sir sharing some drinks.  Lourdes for which teams? Will Spring practice be most important leading into next season whether you want to say specific teams or type of teams like those who are bad or good or whatever. What is the most what what spring practice would be most important for teens. I'm going to say a specific team and it was a team that we watched play last week J mu J mu  Always has a you know, pretty top-tier recruiting class but there.  Replacing some key positions. We're going to have a quarterback battle, whether it's going to go to you know, Rising senior cold Johnson the Lefty gauge Maloney or there's a freshman quarterback Kyle Adams that is coming in that some people are pretty excited about Jamie's going to have a wide open quarterback battle and I think that that decision could make or break the season for JMU to decide, you know, you are the Dukes say  Frisco Contender again, or are they you know first or second round playoff team. I think summer and spring are going to be very important for for the Dukes this year Lawrence. You don't have to answer if you don't want but Matthew Costner does want to know who wins the quarterback job at JMU. Obviously, this is a way to early question. But that's the whole point of the segment if you had a few had to throw one out there right now. Would you have wondered wait see kind of guy?  Well, like I said, a lot of people are really excited about Kyle Adams coming in but you know, I gotta I gotta say I don't think the FCS has ever seen a freshman quarterback come in and be successful, right? Nope. It's never happened. Not at South Dakota state or North Dakota State you and I know but if I had to choose just from what I from what I have seen my pick would be gauge Maloney. I think he is. I think he's ready to go.  Awesome, Kyler first trip you says he loves the pot of page. Thank you so much for all we do to promote the FCS. Thanks to you trip. We appreciate you man. We're just admins on this rival. We appreciate the compliments. He wants to know a semi to early question. But who do you see challenging the Dukes next year in the CAA and will JMU versus Delaware to start the season set the tone for the CAA. So, who do you see being Challengers to the Dukes in the ca next year Kyler?  And how important is that, Delaware JMU kickoff?  I'm going to say Villanova. Now, of course, it's too early and I really haven't gotten to my offseason binge on who everyone's lost who's everyone's gained. But overall, I mean just from my memory. My memory could be way wrong. I thought Villanova had an overall pretty young team. I believe they return a lot again. Don't quote me on that. I haven't done my research completely. I'm giving myself a good couple moments break before I dive into the summer. But yeah, I think Villanova is always a strong Contender they started finding there.  Friends, I think they're going to have a healthy team next year and I think they'll be able to challenge in you foresee a title Kyler going to bounce this next one to you too, man. Cody whirling or wants to know what team do you see next year being the Sacramento State where they come out of nowhere and are a top 10 or top five team. I have a hunch. I have a hunch that you're going to go in a certain direction, but maybe I'm wrong. What do you think? Do you have a team on your mind right now? Okay. Can I figure out what your hunches? Well, I figured  would be Eastern Washington and my backup would be Wofford would be my two even though wofford's a well-known know for one, you know offers in the playoffs every single year offers in the playoffs every single year. And and I don't think saying Eastern Washington is going to return his really a you know, a team that they're going to come out of nowhere, you know, statistically they've been there every other year like pretty so I don't think Eastern Washington is really a team where people would say they're going to come  I know where that's fair. I will say can I guess yeah, can I guess before you go, is it a new Eastern, Washington?  No cow pie. I think I think they don't have the players in place to do an Air Raid Offense right away. I think they're going to Cal poly's going to be a lot better. But you needed a you need to get some BO Baldwin's players under there before they're going to be a true threat actually don't know about a team that's going to come out of nowhere and Via top 10 top five. So, I'm sorry. I don't have it. I bet you it's going to come out of the ca or Big Sky though. They always seem to have one of them.  There You Go, sir a conference possibility for you. All right guys, why is change inevitable except from vending machines Elijah Pierre always hits us with these Elijah change is inevitable because senior classes graduate and then they have to most programs need to you know re load and regroup their classes. So change happens outside of vending machines and with an FCS teams because of graduation.  If these kids could just not graduate things will change it stay the same. So thank you so much for joining us on this hour of counseling and therapy with Elijah Pierre Elijah. We love your questions man. They're awesome Lawrence you have anything to add on to the the change thing looks like you got a cheesy smile going. Yeah change doesn't happen from vending machines because everyone uses credit cards now. I I cannot remember the last time I used cash in a vending machine and if I do use cash in a vending machine, I  it's exact change because that's the only time I'm ever going to use cash in a vending machine. Honestly, I'm not even sure why they put change in them anymore. We're changing the world here on the FCS football fans Vision podcast guys, who's most likely to get exposed and September hall Jones wants to know who is going to get exposed. We're not sure on the answer Hall, but we do know it'll probably be three to four top 15 teams pretty consistently.  Three or four of the top 15 teams, everybody predicts fall off on a cliff and completely go away. So specifics are real tough on that one, sir. Once again, great to meet you. All right, Jacob Martinez wants to know their Lawrence historically at least to see two teams will miss the playoffs the next season they play who would these two teams be from this year's playoffs based on coaching changes in law seniors. Would there be more than two to seeded teams from this year missing the Playoffs as we know North Dakota State James Madison.  He had Sacramento State in there lots of different options. Who do you think could fall off?  The only one I really could see not making the playoffs next year would be Central, Arkansas.  So I don't think there will be two.  I think Sacramento State and muscular would say I'm wrong just because of the quarterback loss and it seemed like once Thompson was injured that just kind of changed Sacramento State season in general and they just weren't as explosive still a quality team. But I think they may be a team that falls off as well. So they're those would be your to their Jacob. You can look at Sacramento State as a possibility and central Arkansas as well for not making the playoffs next season. So alright Jacob Martinez one final one from him.  Kyler Kansas, Kansas. Whoo Kennesaw State question. Do we reload a rebuild this season great playoff performance on one hand, but also embarrassing games against Campbell and Monmouth. Maybe our regular season was are rebuilding question mark what do you see how to Kennesaw decks your DC a rebuild or do you see them continuing to contend there, sir?  I think Kennesaw is a program that has done everything the right way. I don't think you know to answer this question. Did we reload a rebuild? I'm going to say they probably rebuilt a little bit because you guys did have one of the easiest schedules I've ever seen in my life and you still lost, you know game to Monmouth where you got your butts kicked. You played a really competitively against Campbell like you mentioned but I mean as the season goes on that's when you're  Heading to get experience in the triple option is like it or not. None of us think it's a contending type of offense, but it is tough to prep for every now and then and you can make team slip up. So overall, you know, I don't think you guys reloaded I would say you guys probably read rebuilt a little bit. But overall you guys are building your program in the right direction, you're doing all the things you need to do to be a successful Contender to where you're there every single year. So yeah, yeah.  You guys are fine overall. I don't even know if I answered that question correctly, but I'll guess I'll see you up there. You guys are looking what what a program does which is just continued success. So hoo-dee-hoo. Nice work there owls Chris Hammond guys his final one for us. What are your way to early top five? I think we all agree. One of those would be North Dakota State and then that leaves four slots open. I will steal one and I will say South Dakota State I won't  Motive again, Jabari Gibbs is going to be back Cave Johnson and wide receiver Pierre strong offensive line returns besides losing roseboom, which is a big hit the defense returns quite a bit. So I will throw South Dakota state in there next to North Dakota State as bias as that sounds Kyler are Lawrence you might as well throw a tear or two in there. What do you think for a top five?  I think Jamie will make the top five in the preseason poll, whether they finish in the top five is a question that we can dig deeper into in the offseason, but I definitely see the Dukes in the top five in the preseason poll. And I also think one of the Montana's schools will make it and you could choose either one for me. Perfect. Calorie. Can you round out that fist spot my friend? Yeah. I think the preseason top five is actually going to go like this. It's going to go and yes. Ujm you  Um, probably Weber South Dakota state in Montana State. I think that is a good preseason top five to I think it will all end that way know that if I had a bet on five teams in any order, I mean, that's probably what I would lean towards awesome last one here before we get to Adam Willie's final question, which will end our pod guys Dustin right? Good James Madison fan Lawrence. This is for you. He has his own opinion on the matter has he says he's interested in the admin what the admins have to say opinions and predictions for James Madison next.  Even I will they fall off a bit with a 500 season no see a championship. Will they take the ca again making the playoffs are they in Frisco? You know, where is are the Dukes going to land next year in your way too early 2020 prediction and he says thanks again for all you guys do big fan of the page. Thanks to you Dustin. We appreciate you man for and asking questions and being so involved. So Lawrence. This one's for you, man. What do you think about James Madison? I personally think that they're a playoff team minimum unless the quarterback play is beyond.  Awful, and it looks like Kurt cignetti with what he did with the new chain comparison. The last name is the to this season may be kind of that quarterback Guru. So I want to be as concerned with that. So I'd say playoff team minimum. Who knows what happens after that man this early in the January. What do you think, Lawrenceville?  I think we could see the CAA being competitive like it was in 2018. I'm still going to take JMU as the favorite to win because I think with the coaching continuity they will be able to replace those those key bits. You know, Jamie might not be a juggernaut like we were this year. I think there's still a front-runner in the CAA.  And I'm going to pencil JMU in for at least a quarterfinal appearance.  Orders awesome. All right, does it hopefully that gives you some good hope for the next season it's going to be fun to see how it plays out. All right guys last question here to End season 3 of the SC FCS football fans Nation Podcast favorite part about the season besides Frisco was question mark Adam. Willie wants to know mine personally Adam besides Frisco. I was at home for this game and now unbiased bizon Matthew phrase is going to sound pretty biased but  The fourth and one play to beat South Dakota state was probably my favorite moment of the Season besides that just because two reasons one, you know game day was at South Dakota State there are rival. They had a sellout crowd and we just crushed it in that moment. We just took it all away. So from the bias van, I just I love that greedy answer and don't get mad at me South Dakota State fans. You know, I give you a lot of love on his podcast for being a good team. The second part was I was at home with my wife and my two boys.  Boys 3 and nearly two-year old and my dog Charlie and we're watching that game and I was just crazy nervous and sitting on the floor in the living room kids are playing with toys and that happened and I just jumped up and started freaking out and my kids were jumping yelling touchdown. They were freaking out my dog jumped on top of me the whole family just exploded like, oh my gosh what just happened? Sometimes I could just a cool moment to like see an experience. Not that anybody cares about another cool Victory moment for NDSU, but I don't know why I keep always thinking about that moment that I  I enjoyed that. So Kyler. What do you got Man favorite part of the Season besides, Frisco.  My favorite part is finally having hope that Eastern Washington might get a real Stadium soon. The moment that stands out to me of course is my trip out to Eastern Washington to see the Eagles Take on the Montana Grizzlies at Walkers stadium is the second year in a row that I made the trip and for most of the listeners of the podcast they will know that I now currently live in Cheney Washington that was  This trip was kind of what solidified it for me that definitely moving. So it just literally a life-changing moment for me to spend that weekend and Cheney and now I'm going to be spending a lots of weeks in Cheney. Hey guys, it's your unbiased buys an avid Matthew Frazee. Unfortunately due to a little bit of audio issues. We lost Kyler's complete favorite moment of the season for Madam Willie's question.  He went on to talk about a little bit more about Eastern Washington's funding for their Stadium how they've had some great contributions fans of our page including Jamie Williams and others have actually donated. So here's really thankful for that. And then just the play out to the season and our page in general. Sorry. We had to edit that part a little bit. I know a bounce from myself to Lawrence to Kyler's, but I'm just going to do our ending which was also cut off guys.

Welcome to the fit vegan buddy podcast with your host Aaron could tell the vegan coach. The point of this podcast is to give you an in-depth but practical approach when it comes to losing weight being healthy or gaining muscle on a vegan or plant-based diet. We will have guests every single week to help clear up any confusion and make sure that you are 100% confident in your choice of your lifestyle.  Hey guys, welcome to this week's episode where I speak to Matt Pritchard. You probably know him better as the dirty vegan or maybe the one half of dissenters from years ago and into V MTV. So we kind of talked about how he is essentially a man of extremes going from Dirty Sanchez days to stunts.  To ultramarathons to traplines 10 of those in a row and of course now the dirty vegan show that as made it to mainstream TV on BBC Wales. So I hope you enjoy this week's episode. I think it's really important to kind of grasp from tattooed males point of view on the vegan way of living and yeah, I do apologize for the audio quality. I was in Bali at the time and he was in Wales.  And the internet connection was not the best. But yeah, please let me know if you enjoy and happy listening.  Little bit of lascaux, right? We'll get straight into it. I so yeah. I mean, I mean you have done a heap 7 you from Duty Sanders to duty vegan. I think there's a great way of putting it. So before we get into your story, I was like to start my podcast or something super interesting about my guests. So I'll kind of want to know what's the craziest thing that you'll ever done because I know you must have a very long list.  Where do I start?  Let me do this. I'm obviously going to sandwiches. I did a lot of stupid things, but I think one of the getting run over by my friend was still on something on top of the step ladder. That was really one of the first things we did and I went wrong and I was broke my neck, but then I'd say when we went to Prague more anything goes and proudly is not really helped many health.  Safety rules and I said, well I'd like to get shot with her with the shock and at point-blank range was wearing a bulletproof vest and they were all like you are a Lassiter all of us all there's no point. My bulletproof vest is meant to save you. So let's put it to the test. So I put one on and this guy is literally one of the most probably one of the scariest things are looking down the barrel of a gun. No one is about to shoot you and they shot the shot it man.  It blew me back. One of the bullets went through my arm. It went through the bulletproof vest and sort of cut my stomach a little bit and I'm supposing my head off. It was a good Buzz get me wrong. It was amazing. I was like wow man, like survive this in fucking ace but then the cameraman said our shittest. I forgot to press record. Can you do it again? I was like seems to cameras the main camera didn't get it but one of them did and I said you can fuck right off and the guy  You shot me. He just got guy. He just went in early. No, I am not doing that again. So yeah, the first willfully one this one. Yeah, it's good fun, but could have gone wrong, but I hope hey, what's the point? You know, that's that's the point. I you know, you're what's you're saying you can sleep when you're dead. So if you live your life like that. Yeah, exactly. And I mean for people that don't really know you before dirty vegan came along. What's kind of your  Background I suppose of ivory no to do send your stays but like leading up to book before you were vegan. Well I said I studied I left school and I studied catering in University for two years and then I left and cut a long story short bad bad experience in the rest in the in working in a strong sort of put me off a bit and end up cleaning windows and things right?  I was skateboarding and and clean windows really was just needed my my hobby of skateboarding and then I turned professional responsibilities professional and then that meant I could Escape people in between  you can imagine but that age was it was amazing to be able to get paid for something which I was doing since I was 15 years old and then as I started gettin older, I thought this is not gonna this is not going to pay for the rest of my life. So I got a job in the industry as a team manager for a skateboard shoe company called Globe. Yeah, which were based in Australia, but I will traditional Distribution Company.  Be about brands in South Wales and whilst working there, you know ice skate boarding with dating all the time potential and we see Joyce it the old competition, but we were filming and skateboarding and all the stuff because we used to mess around all the time all the pranks and stuff and we decided to put a video together called Pritchard versus Denton and it was me and Dayton skateboarding messing around.  Another Pan Shoals on obviously from the message them Tracy was on the doing his stuff and it was that video really that sort of an MTV talent scout sort of gave me a ring while so is in work and asked me to come in for a meeting and MTV Anna and I swear.  Yeah, that's when everything changed reading and dirty sanchez is born and I spent 10 to 15 years living that crazy life that Sanchez's life which was which was a lot of fun. Yeah. So would you say then that you kind of went from the extreme of doing stunts partying essentially, you know living that really good life were probably alcohol staying up too late late not sleeping and now you have kind of  Of doing the opposite in a way, but also, you know, you're looking after your health a bit more has that kind of What's led you to being vegan or is a completely different to that. No, I mean  I changed I changed that that means quite a few years ago. And I just like I saw myself on tape and some photos of myself, obviously the years years of partying it caught up with me and I just felt right now another state. I mean, I really got to sort myself out and that's when they sort of fun and fitness and they started doing marathons and I and then and all that kind of stuff and I've been doing that since I did my first I am his 2011.  And I just got hooked so I sort of swapping one addiction for another addiction and my neck. My new Addiction was Fitness. Yep. When I first started I was sort of doing the boat addictions at the same time. So burning the candle at both ends, but I thought what if I if I go on and on a fight file cycle, I can go out and party all night and slowly.  Use that and it wasn't just that I just sort of got I just got bored going out and the fitness thing was just so much more interesting. I was far more happier doing that and I just got in into that in quite a big way and then I started realizing they were a lot of enjoy Ultra endurance athletes who were vegan and I just got home.  I wonder why this isn't a started doing my research. I also started making sense. I started waking up a little bit to a lot of bad things going on in the meat industry the daily in the string and then I watch Coast policy because somebody said what conspiracy and I want to go smoothly and that was literally the icing on the cake for me and I honestly thought being naive I just don't being as it was always just don't eat meat  And daily it was just more to it. And I just they just opened my eyes big time the next day. I went vegan straightaway and you know make my eye but I love animals and you just why if I love animals and why am I eating them? And you know, I've got a dog Lemme I live in Tibet your would need him. So why should I be allowed to eat the chicken or a cow or a pig and weird weird you draw that line from  That pig get some cats dog to pick chicken coughs, you know, I mean and it's just yeah. Anyway, I just went vegan and I haven't looked back and I won't be going back. Yeah, I think it's I mean for people that haven't seen what you look like as a mayor you've covered in tattoos. You're obviously, you know used to be a pro skateboarder. You don't really see vegan people looking like you so what was the reaction I guess of  at your nearest and dearest and I guess the community that followed you when you decided that you were going to go vegan.  It was quite funny. When you mention that would begin to a lot of people it's one of the most highly offensive words. You could use for some people for some strange reason. I don't know why but a lot of people said off cool man good on you if that's what you want to do and that if that's what makes you happy then a few days but then I did this that it's then that I realized the once when she say that you're vegan. It just opens up a whole new world a world of shit.  It yeah, and I'm like man or all I'm all I'm not eating dead animals and supporting a fucking deadly industry earning and it seems to be a massive seems to be other people's problem. Isn't that I don't know. I'm got a problem with it. Everyone else has got a problem with it. I haven't but  I hope you know I was three and a half years later some things don't change and still pretty much the same but it's cool man. I know I'm I don't care what anyone says I'm not going to change who I am or what I believe in. I'm gonna carry on doing what I do. I mean, I've come off Twitter because it's just it just got a bit too much for me on Twitter farmers and stuff giving me shit, especially when the TV show come out of other people give me shit as well and I come off Facebook for a bit while I was in Bali for three weeks.  So I started getting on a shit off vegans as well strangely enough, but I mean like for some people you're too vegan, some people you're not vegan enough. So I looked at the end of the day.  So yeah, I'm going off on a tangent Nova. Yeah, but that you know, that's exactly how I feel. I get more shit from from vegans. Then I went from meat eaters because like you said, you're not vegan enough and this you drew every think that way and every little bit counts I think and it's good that you've kind of adopted that same view. So let's talk about Duty vegan. Obviously, that's  Billy how most vegans know you? Yeah what I mean firstly congratulations on getting that into the mainstream because thank you tubers YouTube but BBC is completely different so well done. And what was kind of the mission behind that for you?  YouTube channel the BBC got interested and the whole mission was really to sort of  introduced veganism to everybody without preaching because I know there's a lot people don't like preaching vegans and up, you know, I'm not able to sing then Happy Days you but for me, I find that are Katie people humor and just me being me really hopefully I'll get the message across and that was your point about another the show was to show  To show everybody that a vegan diet can be enjoyed by everybody. And hence why you went to different groups of people like the rugby players to school kids and the women's Institute and just showing all of the different forms of white legalism is good. And that was the whole thing being the shoulder. Yeah, like I think it did its job because since the show  Has been out I've had a lot don't get me wrong of a lot of negative messages as well. But I try and switch them off. But I've had a lot of positives which is that which are the most important ones and a lot of people, you know, thank me for making think about their food choices a lot of people saying they know I have three nights where they don't eat meat and a lot of people who have actually turned full vegan since watching the cell so, you know, if it's done its job and a lot of people liked it.  That's going to be a positive. Yeah for sure. And I think that is a positive and getting it out there in a fun way as I think the best way to kind of influence other people rather than like you said preaching at them yelling at them or judging them. Yeah. So I mean based around your whole life. We seem like the kind of person that's quite outspoken. You're not going to bite your tongue. Have you had any kind of heated debates with people about the vegan thing?  I just don't bother anymore. Yeah, because  I mean I used I did I did not really heat it. Some of them might have got a little bit but I try not to get too heated because there's no point in it doesn't get you anywhere and I just don't bother anymore because the Luke I'm not going to change the mind of somebody who's arguing arguing with me about the fact they like you and meat so it doesn't matter what  They say it's going to change their mind and that's something like notice so I don't bother I mean I do what I do. If you eat meat, that's cool. I don't agree with it, but I can't stop you. You know, you don't hear you're wrong person, but I think you know a lot of people.  Know what goes on in the meat industry and the day the industry, but I just think a lot of people are lazy and they'd rather just turn a blind eye to take action and that's slowly but surely. I think we're I think the vegans are winning. Yeah, the daily sales in a medical gone down like a billion pounds or something like that dick dick dick.  Didn't didn't milk sales in America. That's massive. Yeah, you know and I think that is going to carry on that's going to carry on happening in the meat industry the dairy industry. Yes. Well fingers crossed anyway, so I think we're slowly going in the right direction which is which is really good. Yeah, I would agree and what do you think is the next step for you? Because obviously, you know, you've lived a life of I would say extremes. Like I said earlier what  the next step  Well, I'm currently training for the dagger which is Decker Triathlon, which is 10. Amen 10. I am ends in 10 days. That's the end of July but us I mean, there's two there's one day there's two formats. There's the one a Dave the ten days and there's the continuous verb. I'm doing it continuously. So 25 mile swim in one and then 1200 mile bike ride followed by a  85 mile run and slam all that's going to be finished in 350 hours. That's that's the man. I'm looking at doing know this shit and just concentrating on getting trying to get episode series 2 of dirty vegan and there's a few other projects in the pipeline which was quite exciting, but I can mention yet, but it's all it's all looking good. Really? Yeah looking forward.  So what I mean, what would you say that is that your main driver? Like why are you live the way that you live? Like obviously you've done these things. You've put yourself into situations. I suppose where you've caused harm to your body, but you still done them anyway, and now you've done the vegan thing and doing these massive traffic Lawns wide by what's the motivation behind all those things that you do when I get into something I'll get it.  And you know if I really love someone and I really enjoy it. I want to do everything about everything involved in it. And that's that's when about me right that's my motivation reader. I mean as far as big as I mean, I really enjoy cooking on the good thing about, you know, even though I had a bad experience when I left University.  I still enjoy cooking and when I turned vegan, I found a whole new way of cooking and really sort of relate that real let that fire in my belly for cooking. So I just really enjoy doing that and just yeah, just hopefully trying to get it out there to people that not to not to eat meat and dairy because how bad it is. So that's another thing that keeps me going for that and and then when it comes to  The stuff this is basically a simple. It's what makes me it's what makes me happy and I don't if I don't have exercised or if I don't have challenges in life, then what's the point because the exercise makes me happy and the challenge is something to work towards so that's why I keep doing these things. Yeah, for sure. And yeah, I think follow the channel is again, all of all of the challenges is getting more fucking ridiculous and it's going on and I ain't getting any younger.  Younger but hey, it's all good. No, I think you know when you grow that's when you feel like you're living and one of my kind of sayings as what's the point of living if you don't love right, you know, there's no point, you know Life Starts outside the comfort zone and I think you're kind of an Embrace their very very well. Do you have yeah, I mean I put on I mean these days I'm going to bet obviously if there's nothing happening I got to bed at 8 o'clock.  I'm up at like half or five o'clock in the morning get ready to go to the gym and that's you know, that's that's what I do. These days are, you know, try and live life as much as possible because I'm not that age now. We don't get I'd still enjoy your party who doesn't but they're very few and far between all the were when I when I do go in I got my know when but it's once in a blue moon and  I just can't go after the partier full of of three or four days later can really Angeles and that's why you don't that's why I try not to do it as much but I'm getting up early going to bed early rest in training cooking and they're working. That's perfect for me. Yeah. Do you have any regrets on the way that you've kind of lived up to this point?  No, not really managed. I mean it's taught me a lot and that's what life's about when it you fuck a balloon from it. Exactly exactly. So for anyone that is listening that is thinking of you know, how can I cook more vegan meals? What would be your kind of guidelines might be the top three kind of pointers. They could have for them go into your garden cut the grass and eat the grass typical sketch.  Arrow type of what a vegan would do right by exactly. Oh take a piss, but don't beat yourself up. If you fuck up a lot of foods that have got milk or eggs and stuff. And I mean you just you just wouldn't wouldn't have thought it trainee organic. I'm just good at soup. I mean, it's pretty easy these days to be vegan. You've got a supermarkets and you know my local supermarket, there's quite  Fucking big choice would be against I'll try not to eat many protein process things, but there is a lot of processed vegan food out there at the moment and it but it and it does help people make that change from being a meeting and to a vegan. I just eat personally. I just see a lot of veg and the internet is Awash with tips on helping you become vegan.  So if you ever get stuck just going into that and the answer is always there. Yeah, there is a thing called Google that people can always use right. Yeah exactly when I when I saw an Instagram Instagram is full of ideas as well these days they follow so many vegan things are rather than this just some of the recipes that come up on their brilliant. So yeah, just little things like that. There's so much in for these days we've  You know, we're gonna move our phones everything you need is on. Is it on your mobile phone? Perfect. Yeah and one one more question. How do you think is a good way for people to kind of deal with the mindset that they're not going to be eating meat anymore? Like I know for some people it's like the reason to not harm animals is big enough, but for others, they're kind of not quite there. What would you kind of say is a good piece of advice to help him?  deal with that mindset shift  What for not eating meat? Yeah, so they're like, I'm new vegan, but I'm going to miss me. How do I deal with it?  Just deal with it. It's as simple as that just don't fucking put that cancer stuff in your belly man. That's rich fucking I mean that poor to look look at that up. Look at that poor animal in the face. Look at that animal in the face and say can I kill you and eat you and guaranteed a lot of people say no I can't so if you can't kill that animal any should have no right to go into a supermarket and buy it nicely packaged in some plastic wrap it that's bullshit.  Just just yeah, just think of the animal and that well, that's the way I always do. Anyway, there's no way I could.  I just couldn't really couldn't kill something. Yeah, and I just don't want to eat it. It's not just you know that.  That person has that cow or a chicken that pig their lamb or whatever. It may be. It's got a life and it's got a right to live on this planet and you haven't got to write a killer. Yeah. I think I said yes when you stuck it into a State Assembly trying to think about that. Yeah. I think that's really important to remember where your food is actually coming from because we had this massive disconnect of lamb is not cheap. But real is really we need to think more like that. Yeah, we help people get all of those Lambs in the field the next  Somebody's in there are many women source. So yeah. Yeah, but uh, hey, that's the last away looking that's that's how I see it. I mean it was driving. I was trying to the gym yesterday in the morning and Pitch Black in there were two ducks walking across the road.

Well, of course, I'm going to really suck. That's why I have to go so my brain started having all these racing thoughts. I eat anxieties about training Yogi, and it really reminded me of when I was first starting out in Jiu-Jitsu and  I'm sure many of you can really resonate with the whole getting wound up getting nervous not wanting to go trying to find out reasons why to back out and then getting in the car driving over like oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Am I gonna survive is how bad is it going to hurt? Where's my ego hiding in the corner? Okay, so that was me. I felt like a complete newbie again.  Like well, why don't I just go to G open mad? Why don't I yeah because that's comfortable. I've been training that for several years. Now. I know that noogie is a whole other can of worms and right now it's a can of worms for me, but I I'm getting into it and I just wanted to hopefully inspire you all to sign up or keep going or to try.  An aspect of just to you've been avoiding, for example for those who don't have a wrestling background man takedowns takedowns are just something that we all I'm sure we all wish to execute beautifully because it looks awesome on my speaking of takedowns. I was fireman carried to the ground for two points from my partner and I posted that on Instagram because you know what?  Suck at no key and then hopefully I can look back at that video. I feel proud that I've Advanced considerably from that point but takedowns. That's something I was like, okay, I want to really practice takedowns and then you start thinking about practicing takedowns and maybe it's just easier to do something else. Maybe it's easier to do a fake something into guard pool. I don't know what whatever it may be. Are you avoiding? Trying that new thing? Are you?  You avoiding putting it into play? Even if it looks messy, or maybe it's a complete fail. Yeah, we all have to go through that growing pain of pushing ourselves sucking really bad and eventually eventually getting a Teensy bit better. Now. I have to say in relation to last year. I I feel a little bit more competent we did five.  Or frowns four rounds of shark tank at five minutes each. So there were three of us and we rotated through so I did about 40 minutes or so of straight. Noogie just wrestling and I think that was really good. It helped me stay distracted enough and going with different body types. So I really afterwards I'm really proud.  Of myself, but when I was sitting out for my five minutes like oh my God. What am I doing? Really? What am I doing? Here? This is so so so horrible, but my partner's knew that where I was coming from and that's why I received the invitation because I had expressed I put out there to the universe and to my teammates. Hey, I need more no game my life. And this is how it ended up so I couldn't back down from the invitation and I was free so  I had to do it I had to force myself to go even though I had a bunch of other things I could have been doing. But I made this a priority for my Sunday afternoon and I'm very happy with with the outcome. I appreciate all the messages that I received on things. I couldn't could work on things. I could have done in the moment on my video clips. So I think that's really good food for thought for all my no gears out there many many many.  Thanks. I appreciate the messages. I appreciate the support in my fledgling noogie career. Now. Let's just put that out there. I'd like to go back to noogie worlds in December and perform a little bit better not completely died in my first match. Yeah, I only made it one match. So but I hadn't and that was that purple belt. That was my first actual my  first competition as Purple belt  Yeah, and I hadn't I hadn't competed in no key since white belt. So there you have it. It's okay sign up go do it take the class and get it done. Well, I'll leave you with this tidbit. And if you're interested in following what else I'm doing other than noogie, it's going to be a hectic training camp and you can follow everything. I'm doing and everything. I'm eating on Instagram @ Dr. Dot. Yasi underscore.  It and talk to you soon.
Welcome friends to the fact Checker podcast. This is the show where I make my wee little contribution to the low-carb high-fat ketogenic Community as I document my travels on the course of regaining my health as a once was fat trucker. I know it's been a little minute since my last episode, but I have in my hands.  My latest d-o-t medical physical check. I got a two-year past now. I'll be completely honest with you. I was honestly thinking for about a week before going in there that maybe I should just ease off on the keto going to go ahead and go with a little bit of carbs bump myself out of ketosis because I know that they got the little dipstick thing. They stick in the urine sample and they check a whole bunch of things. What is it about eight something like that six or eight? I know that one of those is they're checking for sugar.  Make sure you're not a diabetic. I'm good with that and I was certain that one of those was going to check for ketones and your urine after you have sugar in your urine. That's a signal that you're diabetic if you have sugar and ketones in your urine, it's a sign that you're out of control diabetic and you're on death's door and that really is a real thing ketoacidosis is a life-threatening medical condition, but my reasoning for thinking about giving up  Kito for a week before going in there is I just didn't want to have to have that discussion. I didn't want him to dip that thing into my urine and go. Oh you have ketones in your urine you're gonna die and then I'd have to explain it. But then I decided with my wife's help love my wife that you know, what just go for it. And if they make a big deal out of it, you got a podcast with many countries in the world listening not that little old me matters, but  You know, maybe I can get the word out there and problems that I had but you know, it was all for nothing nada zilch. Nothing was said about my ketosis. I don't know if he didn't check it if it wasn't on that little sample dipstick or if he just as long as there's no sugar showing that he knows better and just didn't care. Either way. There was no mention of it for my devotee physical. I weighed in at 160, which is one pound over there little chart.  Art doctors chart saying that I'm one pound in the overweight region. Now, of course, that's nothing the whole thing went pretty well and wasn't without an issue. He hooked hooked me up to the little blood pressure machine and it spit out a ridiculous number. I mean, what was that one had to thank God for a man has 157 over 94. If I remember right on there little blood pressure machine. He looked at me funny and said you don't have high blood pressure day. And I said,  No, pretty sure I don't so he shoved a little machine over in the corner. And he said well do this the old-fashioned way. He wrapped a little thing around my arm and stuck the other thing on my vein and time. He got done he come up with 126 over 74 not too bad. And that's with me having White Coat Syndrome. But in his case, he had a blue coat on but it's still the same thing. I don't like going to places like that. This is the first time that that particular location has  Has used an electronic filing for the d-o-t medical certification, but I still had a paper trail. I still had to take my I don't know eight sheets of paper to corporate so they could mail it to the state if it's filed electronically. Why is it being mailed to the state? Unless it's just a fact that it's hard to teach an Old Government new tricks. That might be it speaking of ketones in a urinalysis sample have to revisit the last  So where I talked about Ketone sticks if you're showing week on your Ketone sticks I said, it just means you're fat adapted and you're not letting out as much well got to reassess that because I suddenly went strict got rid of all the artificial sweeteners just for complete transparency. I do still use Stevia and actually honestly I use quite a bit of stevia and I'm peeing purple on my stick again. So I don't know I think that's all up in the air and  and I still think that they're wrong about saying ketones ticks are useless. I've been on keto for the better part of what six months and after I got rid of the artificial sweeteners, I'm being purple again dark dark red paint dark, whatever. I still think he knows sticks are still a valuable tool to have in your Arsenal and a whole lot cheaper than the alternative and I'm cheap and I'm not going with that expensive alternative. I'll keep paying on a little paper sticks.  This episode is brought to you by anchor dot.

Don't laugh. This is not some explicit metaphor for my lack of attention. It hit - 40 fucking agrees as it does. Someone is in Good Old Montreal and the water in my kitchen stinks kitchen sink stopped flowing with a sink full of dirty dishes. No less good times when the plumber the landlord of Kent showed up. I found myself looking at him like cartoon characters. Look at their prey, you know when all this  He's a big steak. It wasn't just the fact that I was post-breakup. I just didn't expect my damn plumber to be high. You know, I was expecting the famed Plumber Crack. I mean potatoes guy with a hearty wife and four kids, but it's very possible. I live in a pretty Progressive television ERA with a to hearty laugh track somehow Alexa was 35 and Ash Russian with a thick stack thick accent in broken English and rugged work boots paint splatters calloused hands with  about gloves lines on his face that told stories. I would never know and a crystal clear blue eyes rugged and distant and sexy as hell. He was eyeing me in a less than professional way, but it was all in his eyes and it seemed clear that whether or not he died women every single day. He had been taught to control himself.  I did what any self-respecting where any heartbroken gal would do. I showed him a Pious the ones under the sink the water stopped yesterday. I said, he smiled and kneeled I was wearing a red fleece bathrobe and nothing else. He caught me by surprise by showing me. It's seven fucking a.m. Instead of eight. You don't want your pipes explode. He said his first words. No, of course not I cannot do a Russian broken English accent. So  We leave the faucet on a little he stood to make sure the knob was turned slightly. Do you have a hair dryer? Yeah, I went to the bathroom and return with my hair dryer only after handing it to him that I realized that there was a sticker on it that I wished wasn't it was a naked woman with her legs spread and in between them was written to me. I hope he would just take the damn thing and not noticed but no such luck. He glanced at it and then it me and grinned. I'm feeling hungry he  And I turned probably as red as my bathroom. I smiled and comfortably and left the room for my bedroom. I could hear him doing his best to warm my pipes with the hair dryer in hand. This went on for several minutes. And then I heard a soft knock on my bedroom door. Yes. I said opening it. You have space heater. He asked yes. I said and turned around to hand him. The one I had in my terribly insulated room as I  I turned to hand it to him my bathroom my bathrobe loosened and he was standing there heating or heater in hand staring. I looked down to realize that my left breast was mostly exposed and quickly drew the Rocha. Sorry, I laughed this time and it was mostly genuine how ridiculous had I become get your man to fix these pipes and be done with it as long.  Don't be sorry. He smiled and return to the kitchen. I followed him and watched him plug the heater and then place it under the sink so that it was close enough to warm the pipes you leave this like maybe three hours. He said water should come on. If no you call me again. Okay, I wondered why I hadn't just Googled how to unfreeze a pipe on my own but I also like the idea of calling him. Okay. I said thank you for your help. He picked up his box of tools and made to leave then.  Un-pause, you're very beautiful. He managed looking me up and down from be robe tousled hair and all. Okay. Thank you. I responded somewhat taken aback, but also not so are you in as soon as I said it? I knew I couldn't be taken back. He put down his box on the kitchen counter and placed his hands on his hips staring at me.  I suddenly knew that I would not be letting him leave any apartment. And so we'd made some sort of physical contact. I was the shovel sure but I knew I looked good. I knew I'd that post-relationship glow that comes to creative types of shaken off long-lived wet blanket romantic Dynamics and live to fuck again. I'd slept. Well, he did not appear to wear gloves even in minus 40 his huge hands were chapped and I did what any caring home.  This what I reached out and took his hand in mind caressed it a little rough hands. I said you work hard. It happened really fast. His hands moved to my bathrobe hips and hold me close till we were touching and they moved up to cut my face as he kissed me. I let him leave. He started slow just a few tiny pecks on the lips.  And I return them staring full into his sharp blue ocean eyes with my deep dark brown ones. He stared back and then slowly enter my mouth with his tongue gently explore bit my lip lightly. I reacted by pulling his hips on a mine. I'm pretty sure my eyes rolled back in my head. He was leaning against the counter and I was leaning into him at this point his hands move down from  Face to my ass he began cupping and jiggling it and His Hands through my bathrobe is are kissing got deeper and Wilder. I ran my hand over his hard muscular chest through his button-up work shirt. The fabric was thick but I could still feel what he was hiding. He pulled the back of my robe up with his hands and let out a low moan as he began meeting and massaging. My bare ass. His hands were as rough as they looked.  Their texture on my soft skin made me very wet. He turned around moved his toolbox to the floor and gripping my hips the man scooped me up like nothing at all.  I wrapped my legs around his waist he placed me on the counter. So I was just sitting with his tools did Ben and he slowly undid my hastily tied bathroom. I let it fall from my arms to my hips.  They are was naked sitting on my discarded bathrobe in front of this man who I allowed into my home at 7 a.m. On a Saturday there. He was taking me in with his eyes not missing an inch my caramel skin my flat stomach. My bald pussy my large and shapely labia that hung down just a bit. I opened my legs to give him a better look.  He was fully clothed. I like how naked I was and how geared up he was still in Boots shirt pants. He took off his thick Army coat, which even wearing unzipped and tossed it top of the tool box. The room was warmer than usual. Thanks in part to the space here.  No roommates, he asked no, he smiled and began caressing my soft little tits with his truly large hands bouncing around slapping them.  Encourage she grabbed the nape of my neck with one hand roughly and bent down to lightly bite and lick them. I lost all control reaching out to hold his hips with the soles of my feet continue downwards to bite and kiss my navel my hips. He took his time on my hips grazing them with this saw smell.  I remember thinking wow, he takes better care of his lips than his hands and then he was gliding his tongue over my eager pussy lips biting them gently and sucking a low guttural sound escaped me as I slouched back awkwardly into the kitchen cupboard and then Alexa the morning plumber started fucking me with his tongue in and out and moved it like a small cock into my what already slit is he?  Done. He would flick upwards very slightly and the effect had me shuddering melting from the inside wanting nothing more than his cock to take his place. I reached down and felt him through his pants. He was rock hard. I sat up and unbuttoned his shirt, but he made no move to take it off. He just stood there Breathing heavily. I unbuckled his sturdy Bell unzipped his pants.  And move them down past his ass followed by his black boxer briefs rather than take them all. He left them to mingle with his work boots down around his ankles his cock hard long but not too long and thick hopped off the counter and kneeled in front of them on on the kitchen tile the grab a dish towel for padding. I want you to fuck my face.  I said pretend my face is a pussy. Okay?  I open my legs wide because it made me feel like an amazing slut and I opened my mouth wider waiting.  I didn't have to ask twice. You're a whore. He asked smiling today. Yes for you.  He like that answer and grabbed me by the hair the back of my head jamming. His cock is my mouth slowly, but firmly until it tip was kissing the back of my throat. I gagged a little he began thrusting into my throat hole. I gripped his cock tightly with my lips as he did and let my tongue relax and run its way around his head. He had his mind and held me tight by the ears as he fucked my throat harder and faster.  With each thrust my legs slipped further apart on the tiles to my knees hurt, but I became the wetter and wetter for his call.  He stopped slut suddenly and I fell backwards onto the floor. He laid my bathroom on the floor folding it in half to create a soft Surface by down. He said so I did on my back on the road on the kitchen floor. He finally kicked off his boots and pants and briefs and even dropped his shirt into the vial.  His broad chest was Harry. My man had a six-pack. I reached up with my foot to run my toes like over it a Kroger it across it read try Ridge. He smiled you like me whore.  Yeah.  Kneel down that my knees and push my legs up and apart. He looked my pussy a few more times for good measure. He then grabbed a condom from his coat pocket and rolled it on stealthily which made me laugh and was a really because it meant I didn't have to ask. He smiled caressing my face you're fun girl, and then he slowly pushed his cock inside of me falling onto me chest to chest.  I hugged him close and I felt I would never close my legs again. I'd relaxa fuck me that money. I grew warmer and melted all over him. I grown and I rocked with him. I thought to myself we don't need these space heater. So he to warm up the pipes anymore. And as I looked up and window at the snowy branches and neither cold was almost over.  Spring was coming. I like so I Rose to his knees and continue fucking I began rubbing my clit at the same time could not take his eyes off my fingers it drove him crazy. I could feel him getting even harder inside of me if that was at all possible. I imagined my ex-boyfriend walking into the room at that exact moment to watch me getting fucked on the floor like an animal by my insanely hot buff plumber.  I imagine him getting turned on watching me ripping out his cock to Jack to the side of me my legs spread my pussy pounded and my fingers moving in circles on the outside of my quickly typing home Mo and louder and I looked once more at Alexa is chest is very serious clear blue glaze which without any words at all is making me feel like a filthy slut.  There we go.  My muscles gripped his cock. So it's white so tight that I squeezed him out of me. It's my back arched and I came and incredible Roar escaping my just fucked through my thighs shook.  Alexa stroked his cock maybe five times Max. He was coming and patterns on my heaving stomach. Wow. I said setting up a thin stream of water was flowing from the kitchen faucet. We both laugh. Can I call you? Anyway, I asked I feel like I should slept.  That was not my story. That was cold.  Spring by oil coal or Keller way of Kali
Hey, it's mined gold if I sewed 13, which I'm really excited about. But before I talk to you about what we're going to talk about on episode 13, and with who or whom if you're going to be that guy. I just wanted to thank everyone who gave me positive feedback about episode 12, which was obviously the still who pursued featuring just me. Yeah, because that was like a bit of a  Scary thing to do, I guess because you know the whole imposter syndrome like as what I'm saying worthwhile. Is it resonating with anyone? Like why am I doing those? What's the point does anyone care kind of thought process which I struggle was a fair amount in most of my Pursuits. So it was really nice just to hear from people that they like valued what I was putting out there and I guess appreciated.  What I was trying to say, I guess thank you. So yeah, I really appreciate that and thanks Jason who was the inspiration behind that episode? So yeah, I feel not should about it. So that's great. Yeah week's been pretty stressful just didn't like, you know my other job, which I never really talked about on here because you know, I don't want to like bored people away. Yeah, but it's okay. I'm okay.  Looking forward to spending some time not there this weekend and I'm really excited to have our next guest on the podcast today. So her name is Sophie has it over and she is what I would consider a high-performance human. I was actually speaking with her the other day because she was asking me I like what sort of people do you have on like what's kind of urine?  In behind it and I was like, well, there's not really like a specific theme. It's more just like if I find someone's habits or someone's story or someone's mindset motivating and I feel that like them sharing it could help others then like that's the sort of person that I want on. So it doesn't matter if you are an athlete if you are famous or anything like that at all, it's it's mainly just the mindset and  I guess I like, you know, there's kind of aspects of this that I like seeing other people and I'm just like fuck that school. And Sophia is definitely one of those people so I've known Sophia for maybe four years, but the first time I met her I used to work at a gym up the road and she happened to be doing a training session there with her coach who happens to now be my coach  And she was like lifting some pretty heavy shit pretty well. So I you know being the creep that I am like went over and just like introduce myself. It's like hi. You're strong. Can I be your friend? And yeah, basically now we are friends and we've been friends ever since so it's kind of cool. So yeah, I'll let Sofia tell you a little bit more about her because she knows a lot more about her than I do, but basically the reason she is on here as  I think we can all learn a lot from her high performance habits. Yeah, because she's a fucking Legend and she has some serious big dick energy, which hopefully will get into in a little bit. So yeah, thank you so much Sophia for joining us today. Go. Hey Sarah, how are you? There? You are fancy seeing you here fancy seeing you here in my apartment. So nice of you to spend your morning with me and Graham.  And your first cuddle first cuddle first coffee. He intoxicating he is the day he is it's so funny actually had this like random personal Instagram. Is this a thing for you g get ran a former student Instagram all the time? Yeah, right. It's where everyone gets a creeper. Yeah. Anyway, this wasn't a creep. This was like a really cool lady like basically unless it's like a dick pic or like a gross comment or like a snitch man. That's fine. Yeah, you know, so anyway, this lady was like hey,  Just thought I'd let you know like I really don't like cats but I love your cat. He is the best at I'm like fuck you lady. Oh, that's a compliment such a high compliment for him and he always gets that because they usually hate cats they meet him and it's like who you are and so cat he turns you does. He really does look at him beautiful cat he is doing their job. We're not literally just going to talk about great we should do it probably could.  How are you? How are you? Oh my god cracking like I'm real croaky right now because you literally got me out of bed high-performance attitude fell over did not hear a single a literally this is really good because my whole intro is about how like high performance habits and like you're like the embodiment of like high performers that I'm like outside your place being like mate. I'm outside. Where are you? I'm just putting on my pad because it goes both ways. Like I'm functioning in a hundred ten percent all the time when it implodes just like leave me to my mess.  In a day, I'll be fine. Yeah. No, I definitely understand that when you're like at such a high level of functioning. It's like you go through it's like all or nothing. Yeah, basically yeah, somebody want my ass for me like which graduation dinner a couple of days ago and my partner was amazed at how incompetent I am when like the stress falls off. I've had a couple of drinks and I just I just can't a dolt so he was impressed how I go from like a running the event to like, oh laying on some grass going home.  Moving that's the best though, I guess is that balance. Would you define that? It's balanced. I honestly I actually think it shows how little balance of got because I've either got it all together in like a military Precision or I'm tired. I'm over it and I've got nothing together. Yeah, so those patches never lost because I can't afford to let them last but there's definitely like  a spot of time every month or I'm just like I can't handle I'm gonna lend been watching Netflix a conduit. Yeah my God, I have these exact same things interestingly that they want some answers. Yeah, because yeah, let's talk about what you're actually highly functioning at because the I just assume that everyone knows everyone that I talk to ya about but you know, let's say literally no one knows who you are and what you do in which case shame on, you know, I'm not that special.  I just know a couple Legends like this on your best a show. So what do you what are you high performing in currently? Sure. So since none of you know me at all. I retired from Olympic lifting few months ago. I was pretty good at that but concurrently, I've been polishing off a law degree. So it's my second degree. I've got a degree in politics both from the University of Melbourne adequate enough grades, like sitting on a distinction average, even though worked and supported and life.  And you know all those things gosh, what else am I doing? This seals on the law student Society. I was a third-year representative, which means I had to put together the yearbook and graduation dinner and deal with all the mess that comes with helping coordinate 350 highly functioning highly stressed people. I'm also on the committee of our weightlifting Club as a secretary. So helping sort things out on that respect earlier this year. I did some teaching in one of my favorite subjects.  The list goes on sale price is a lot going on. That's exhausting. Yep. Objectively. Yep. So when do you finish so you finish your degree this year? No, not quite so some shit went down middle of the year. So I've had to extend and push some subjects over to next year. So I'll finish around June next year. Okay, but the end is in sight. Yeah, definitely quite like this is the last painful semester off that it's just a bit of research and elected by love and  that's it. So how did you find try to balance being a high-level athlete with obviously being in a profession almost that's also very high level and at some point you obviously had to make the decision where I can't be doing these two things to the to the level that I want to be doing them.  Something's always going to give right and if you've got to Pursuits like a highly passionate about it's not going to be either of those. It's everything else and neglect family. You neglect friends. He neglects mental health. You neglect sleep like you neglect everything that's not showing up to UNI showing up to work showing up to the gym. Yeah. So everything else just Falls over and you accept that that's just the cost of trying to multitask at a high level in several things.  Because you got to be an idiot to think that you can perform highly as highly as you want or multiple Pursuits. So not only did I have to give up everything else. I was going on in my life. I also had to have a real expectation check in terms of well exams roll around around Nationals every single here. I'm necessarily going to perform worse at both than I would if I was focusing on just one. Yes, you've got to do an expectation check like the best you can do is no longer about  I work the result I'm going to get is going to be what I deserve. It's going to be well fuck night make some make some adjustments because it's just physically not possible and whatever you can do is going to have to be enough. Yeah.  And I guess that's from someone who has really high expectations like of yourselves and obviously your performance that's quite hard to accept I would imagine for sure know it sucks especially because like everything we do in life whether you like it or not. It's competitive in the sense of comparative. So like even competitions I'll see girls that are you know, my weight class my skill level and because they're you know, they've got a part-time job and that treating themselves as athletes full-time, but I recovered performing better clearer.  All those things like fuck man. I could be doing that but I'm stressed a shit. I sit down for 20 hours a day. Don't sleep enough. I eat weird. Like there's all these things that you took off in your head where it's like I could be that good. I have the potential I could be better than you but I've got the stupid law degree to deal with. Yeah. This is that like reality check on both sides. The equation is really hard. Yeah. Yeah, I think actually I heard somewhere that I think it's  Like beyond having three things in your life that you're focusing on like you literally can't don't the capacity to actually handle anything else. So for example, you've got like family relationship work training like one of those things is gonna so I'm gonna give full fuck off right? So I mean for a long time I was single and that was great because much free time. Have you got mates about next level? Yeah, you know, so you've got time to put the germ-free and a half.  Yesterday, you know in the evenings you're fucking mobilizing you doing yoga. You're reading you're going to bed at 8:30 and you feel so good. And then you meet someone and suddenly like your life schedule. Should I schedule just because you're like well, you know Thursday nights, I would normally go to yoga. But oh, but we could have date night and it's like motherfucker the bit that really sucks me asleep. Yeah. Well, I love having a partner. I love loving my partner. I fucking hate anything messing with my sleep. Yeah, me too.  I'm an ogre like him. Yeah. Yeah bad because we're so busy. I'm sure you'd be the same you were really tight schedule very long time and he's howling. All right, we've got to be here at eight and then we've got to get this and then you do this and then I'm going to go here. Yeah, like, okay. I'll just get in the car. Yeah, exactly leave rusted like Tanana a six and a half hours sleep. It's gonna be awesome. But your partner's there. Of course, you're not going to get six and a half hours sleep. So your mediocre rusted sleep gets even less. Yeah, look up feeling grumpy because you're behind on your sleep. Now you have an optimized out.  You need to recover it's not for us. So I guess I mean at a high level like you're going to have to make sacrifices whether that's you don't have a relationship. Yeah, are you work less? All these things are sacrifices and I guess it's like how much do you love that vocation that you're willing to and what are you willing to sacrifice for it? Like for a long time like having a relationship having a social life for me. That was worth sacrificing. Yeah, and now I mean  I mean, I mean people say have said to me before that. I don't have balance and I'm just like so obsessive things that I'm into but I guess I've always thought and I guess you kind of touched on that earlier. Is that like if you are like a hundred percent passionate about this thing and that's what you want to fucking do like, you just can't really have balance like it's not really as much of a thing balance is such a it's just a fiction. I think I think she's in there. If you want to be impressive if you want to be good you're going to scare people and you're going to make choices all the people don't respect you can escape.  Well, that's fantastic. I totally agree and like the intensity with which you apply yourself to what you're passionate about is fucking scary. You are obsessive you are Marik because there's all sorts of there's also the cost of if I fail I've made all these sacrifices for nothing. Yeah hundred percent and people aren't prepared to do that and I'll prepare to back themselves to that level which is why they look at you and me and they go you don't have balance. That's bad. Look at me. I have balance and like no, you know drinking Friday Saturday night you achieved. Oh, yeah. Well done. What have you got to show for?  Ooh, yeah, exactly. And I mean I suppose I would rather like pull out all the stops and like if I don't get to where I want to be I'm not going to say oh, that's because I didn't really try. It's like I literally gave it a hundred and ten fucking percent and that happens to be my best effort. Yeah, you know and if that's not getting to where I want well, I don't have anything to blame it on. Yeah, but I think the people would so much rather have these excuses and be like Oh, but my relationship oh, but my my job all but this it's like wow making excuses for mediocrity. Yeah, exactly and I  How bad do you want this thing? Yeah, you know don't fucking tell me you want to lose weight. If you're not going to do what it takes to lose weight. Don't tell me how to be successful. If you're not prepared to do what it takes. Like we all talked about how CEOs get five hours of sleep and they, you know do meetings on the treadmill in the morning and she like that. It's like ha ha that's hilarious. Whatever. I'm like no fucking isn't that's the cost of being successful in a high-pressure career. Yeah. It's the same with everything. If you're not willing to give it what you know, it takes shut the fuck up. You don't actually want it you like the idea of exactly and that  Has plenty of other things in life that you can be doing that don't require being at the gym. Yep. Half the day. Yeah, you know, but fucking pick something. Hey look something in pick something and be good at it. Don't be shitty everything mediocre everything. That's the best don't be shitting me. She's a fucking Legend depths. I she wants the Olympics in synchronized swimming amazing. The bitch is a Savage like she retires from synchronized swimming.  He's in law school gets killer grades transitions to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. She's got a comp tomorrow today that I'm going to also she's an absolute Savage anyway, but her yearbook quote is be less shit. Like her life motto is just be less shit. That's so good. And it definitely understands the intensity. She brings to everything but in short piece something I'd be fucking good at it. Yeah, go ahead at full Pace hundred percent. Yeah. She sounds like she has some fucking big dick energy or massive.  Have like she's 58 killers on the fat days and she's a small human but she is Savage. That's amazing. Yeah, that was the other reason that I wanted you to be on he actually something together to make Duke Energy thing. So for all of you who don't follow me on Instagram, I started hashtagging this bde big dick energy thing came about actually this is quite hilarious story because I Emily and I am Ali  Basket who was on and really a podcast. I was helping her coach a couple of weightlifters at a comp recently and I was videoing these guys when they were lifting on the platform and obviously like videoing whilst going fucking come on. Yeah. I didn't get out of here general just aggressive levels of encouragement and one of the guys I was filming Alex he sent me messages.  Later on in the day and was like, I just showed these videos to one of his housemates and his housemate was like fuck that chicks. Got to have big dick energy. He's like the best compliment. I don't ever I was like like zero literally take the big dick energy then we started training day anyway, so that's how it started but having looked at  This concept further because I can see why it could be misconstrued or potentially be offensive. I'm not really bothered. If it's event. It's a vending you right now to be honest. I was gonna paint it. So Anthony Bourdain famous chef very aggressive and I guess his and his manner like a Gordon Ramsay asked kind of this is fucking me deal with it. Obviously a really high achiever.  A lot of masculine energy, I guess from him. So when he passed away recently someone put up a Twitter comment about him like rest in peace bubble blah and made a comment about his big dick energy. And that is actually where the concept was born, which I thought was quite interesting and you my friend possessed this big dick energy. Good. I'm glad I think like for me what it means and it  To do with like having a dick being man, I guess the reason that it's called Big that energy as it refers to a guess a masculine level of this is fucking me salty or that self-assured confident and I guess like Unapologetic an apology. Yes, that's fucking at yeah. Yeah, and this reminds me of that time at training that those girls tried to come in and use the bathroom. You're like note members only. Bye.  Just like so blunt. And so like you cannot use our toilet. Yeah, and I was like, that's so hilarious like those Concepts behind it because there's signs and shit. It's time storm the fuck in would like some time alone that dump but he's still mad about it. I like I'm a big human so I'm aware that I can intimidate if I front up the someone. So I generally don't I give people space whatever you're not even that big as just your aura of.  Big big big dick energy like it's just you're on your metaphorical dick existing funding from your body. But which is like giving people suffice if I walk the word see the bitches stole down the hall this entire horde of dumbass. It faces like they walk into a public bathroom. This is a private Stadium. Yeah, super secure this he has finally died of what I have to fucking stick gym anyway, so they stole me in and I like pull my hand out like you can't use the bathroom here because it's not a public bathroom I could  Ross the oval there's a fucking public bathroom then like like making bullshit excuses why they have to use our bathrooms like no members only turn around go so they have some more weight or guys, by the way, they're like 12 years old. They are not 12 the like 16 probably drunk already anyway, so I turned around send them on their Merry fucking way and I'm seething because we had a similar situation of while ago and so I looked about Google review about how the coaches at our gym on rude and I'm like to be fair.  Some of them are but it's just that I turned away from using up Issa and they'll like all the coaches a whole lot of really really rude and like no one not. It's a private Stadium. I told you to leave I didn't even swear you I'm just wearing it all the way off. I've opened a word. It's such a word and that's the word. I was perfectly delightful tomb just forceful. He could say yes, but blunt blunt. Okay where to put it so they've been introduced a big dick energy.  Another form of not being allowed to use the bathroom, but I guess a more may be productive way. This is yeah of applying this energy would be in the sort of Industry that you are now in and also obviously as a weightlifter like that's a sport where you know, it's kind of like I'm going to fucking lift this heavy weight. It could possibly you know crush me in the throat. Yeah, for example, it could break me it could break the kids out here. Yeah, so you've got to have  An amount of aggression in a certain amount of I guess it's belief in yourself and believe that you fucking deserve to be here in this moment. And I think that's why I like so many awesome checks that I know like you and Emily Emily Katie like we attract these similar women who have the same. No, you can't use our fucking toilet. Yeah. Well, it's such a it's definitely a mood. It's exactly what you said. It's it's me in the bar and either I'm going to win or gravity's going to win. Yeah, and if I don't win it,  Could end it really badly so you can't back yourself halfway lifting isn't a halfway sport. It's not like I'm not going to pick on any sports but it's not like I'm taking a shot I missed. Oh well if you miss a heavy lift, you will fuck yourself. Yeah, so you either back yourself entirely or sit the fuck back down? Yeah, which is what I admire about it. It feeds into that problematic attitude. We've got of All or Nothing. Yeah, like it's like what that doesn't Foster or encourage a balanced way of thinking. Yeah. There's no nothing half a step.  No, nothing. No, you're not gonna like go to pick up that way and then be like, oh, maybe I just left a half way. Yeah, I'm gonna still a half wrap. But what does that actually though? Literally? I did do that yesterday. It does happen. Sometimes just missing wife, but like on a proper Max attempt of a snatcher clean. You don't really have the option of going halfway. No and there's no way that you're going to come back after a compen. So I was going to be what did you feel that left? I didn't really didn't really try on the yeah. Well, you didn't fucking try on that one. Yeah exactly.  Really, but I guess like the industry that you're now and then we are going to be working. I guess what predominately for the next fuck couple decades. Yeah, exactly. Maybe there are some I mean that's so fucking Cutthroat as wow. It isn't it isn't right because Cutthroat implies like a problematic sense of I'm going to succeed or you're going to succeed there for you're in my way. Yeah, it's not necessarily like that because the industry is hard in the sense that like the generation before us went through.  No one gave a fuck about how you're doing as a person because there's ten candidates for any job. So it's like a very  adult appropriate phrase to use for is like so like a pump and dump industry. They use you extract value from you you burn out your problem kind of thing. Yeah, I think that's like to shift and yeah, it's still a thing like it's a hard industry whatever they work you hard but you just have more options and because you have options it's less personally competitive. It's more like well, I want this track. I know it kind of sucks. I know it's really hard with this is what I want if you don't stick around here you go do something else that's for you to decide on yeah. Okay, so it's less cuff her and more just intense and  Different Paths of different degrees of like Financial reward emotional reward intellectual reward. Yeah. It's just that yeah. What so what sort of specific area like will you are saying five years? What are you going to be doing? What would you envision yourself to be doing? So because I only finish middle of next year. I'll start my graduate position either like September October next year or March the following year because I've got a couple of intakes.  Thinking corporate for the foreseeable future partly because for one the corporate training programs are so well-heeled. Like if you get into a big top-tier corporate firm, they'll pay for your training. They train the shit out of you like you walk out a very functional lawyer' lawyer ring machine because they invest so much in you because they do hard work high-value work high profile Works. They need their Juniors on point. So definitely corporate the start with because the training is off chops. The reason I might stay in corporate is  Only corporations have the money it takes to change the law. Okay. Sure. The legal system is fucking expensive and for like the small guy to get an outcome that fundamentally changes. The law is so expensive that it only happens very rarely when a charity or a non-for-profit bankrolls it so if you want to be at the Forefront of law, you've got to be in commercial law the areas that the money is big enough that you want to run it all the way to the high.  Court to change something. Yeah. Okay. So if you want to be at the like The Cutting Edge of the law changing you got to be in corporate at this point in time. Anyway, if anyone's going to change any laws, I can definitely see you being the one to do it. Well, we'll see how we go. It's just going to be like the battle of the big dick energies. That's literally what it is. Yeah. I like top-tier law is very much like that. The people at the top are all exactly like the unapologetically. This is me. I'm better than you all Let me show ya I guess it's like kind of  Refined to think that you have to have that certain level of confidence all the time because I don't know about you but I like have a lot of I guess self-confidence issues and insecurities around like who I am what I'm doing and often questioned like am I good at anything as anything I do worthwhile. And I don't know I guess I've always thought that just means I'm not I'm not good at what I'm doing because people who are good don't have those thoughts but have us because you  don't know that everyone does that. Yeah, but that's the thing is like the more I've talked to about people about this like imposter syndrome and I haven't talked about this quite a few times across the last few episodes is that you know, I know if you listen to the episode with Celia Piccola, she's a comedian and she's on TV and She lays and you think like someone like that it's got to have like this insane level of confidence. Yes, and you know, obviously like in their ability and the fact that much  Everyone loves them and like the getting Awards and they like revered and the got it. Yeah, they've got it but I mean no. Yeah, I was terrified as the aisles. Yeah. No, I totally got that. So it's kind of like you have to just like fake like fake it almost absolutely and I feel like a lot of the time that I'm that I'm doing that, you know, like I'm putting across this level of confidence in my ability and what I'm putting out there to people, you know the inside I'm just like oh my God  Please like me. Yep. I totally got that spark. Yeah, it's bad. Um, I went to drama school knows little and the reason I went to drama school is because I only learned English at the age of 10 and mom was desperate for us to get our conversational skills and like confidence up as quickly as possible because being an immigrant sucks being immigrant with bad English sucks more because we're an English-speaking country. We grew up in New Zealand. So mom sent me to drama school and I realized very very early on that if you don't want to  MOX fuel level of language skills or for your accent of your expression or anything like that. What you do is you lean the fuck in every time you fuck up you lean in like it was intentional and so you learn to back yourself in terms of like well, if I project that I don't give a single. Fuck what you think about me. You're not going to feel like there's any reward in mocking me. Yeah. So you learn that real real quick. That's bad as a kid Hestia clean the fucking. Yeah, so whenever I'm freaking out the most  I make sure that I just become as Unapologetic as possible. Yeah, because then there's no reward for mocking. Yeah my God, that's amazing. I fucking love that. And so everyone that I sent me real. Well, I'm fake it till you make it is literally how I live my life because obviously as I pointed a visual, you know, the same you put in the preparation, you know, you've trained or you know, you studied or you know, you've meal prep. Do you know you've done whatever the fuck you need to do to exceed at the task at hand.  Not residual panic and insecurity and all of that it can only detract from your preparation. If you let it if you let yourself implode and undermine the work they've actually done but if you've got the base your brain going I'm not good enough. I can't do it. I fucking hate like your brain has nothing to do with at that point. So you need to go. Well, this is my base. This is what I'm putting out there and I'm just going to lean in yeah. Yeah, I think I say Leah actually mentioned this which I thought was really important. Was that like  Just because your brain is telling you something it doesn't mean that it's true. You know, we just we listen to the thoughts in our head like the gospel. Yeah, you know what? I mean? Yep. Yeah. I think that that can often be so crippling and that can stop us from going all in because we've got this little voice in your head saying but what if you can't do it, yeah, you're not good enough and I think to a certain extent we've all got that so it's just about you know, how much of that you taking on board the less you take that on board the more you're actually going to succeed but it's just a  Kind of trying to ignore that she was just real quick. And I guess like this is a little crisis. I had I've recently I had a full-blown meltdown a few weeks ago would have been literally about that and like not giving yourself an out and I realized that like, if you look back through all the major things that I've aimed for, I've always fallen just short of the cherry and then from that extrapolate as like fuck man, that means I've been so busy and spreading myself so if down across so many different things  Things as an out, so if I don't hit the cherry on whatever it is, I say I'm all in for I've got an out to say well I was doing so many things concurrently. I couldn't have possibly yeah. Well I have exams. Well, I exactly and realizing that I was like creating out for myself by spraying myself. So thin made me like mentally blokes was like fuck man. That's not a high-performance attitude that's making excuses in a different form. Yeah and realizing that fucking sucks because I looked back through and I was like, well, I was point three short of a perfect score out of high school.  I was like to punch short of getting a scholarship for my degree. I was two kilos short of the Commonwealth Games. I was you know, a percentage short of this High distinction. I really wanted why because my dad died I couldn't be bothered because I was too damn tired from doing everything else, you know, all of these things stack up and you're like, well, I've just been making myself out and that is fucked. I think your dad dying is a fear out my no fat no fat but I mean like Dad dies you're allowed to take a break.  Just FYI. Yeah, that's just one of those things like because you don't factor in a life is also going on. So you give yourself an out by being too busy an actual life thing happens and you fall short of your goals and like well did the best I could so that's something that I want to work on into the future being spread less thin because I want to see if I can actually hit that cherry if I don't give myself the out of well, I'm also doing this at a high level.  So I'm actually going to give a decent craft of properly specializing in the next couple of years. Yeah, so is that part of the reason behind your decision to retire from weightlifting competitively? Yeah, so that came down the same time and like Nationals were coming up and like eight nine ten weeks had to go overseas deal some family stuff. I had exams coming up and I was like, well, I could pull all of this off adequately and get sung Praises because I'm balancing so successfully or it could just fucking lean in and do something properly. Yeah. And so I think that's a point in my life.  Not now, I want to lean in and do something properly. Yeah was that was that ad if I mean, obviously it would have been a really difficult decision to make I assume hmm. I suppose especially because you're a liberal you are a lot of your identity would have been tied up in that sport. You knew was a weightlifter and obviously being such a big part of the community being part of the wa and all that.  Yeah, how did you find that making that decision and I guess I would think it would be more having to deal with people's opinions about it. I think that would piss me off the most um, a couple people did the whole like you could have been so good. You could have done this you could have done that qualified for this and that and I'm like well fuck mate like thanks for that. Yeah. That's very helpful. Thank you for telling me. I've missed out on opportunities. I could have had thank you all so much telling me that I've disappointed you. Yeah, like what? Yeah.  A couple people did that thing, but I had a good thought I'd think about it and I was like well overall overwhelming sense of relief because I no longer have to be confronted with the fact that well. I'm about to fall in the rankings because I'm trying properly because I've been overseas bearing my father liked not having to deal with like the crippling anxiety. All of I'm not gifted than you. I just literally can't train enough to beat you right now not having to deal with that is awesome. Yeah, that's not you can walk up onto the platform be like, hey guys, just so you know my dad died.  I'd and the 30 seconds before you left. Ya Na and thing is no one gives a fuck as an athlete. What you do on the platform is a representation of how good you are and because I could no longer put in the amount of time and effort that was required partly because of family stuff partly because of law stuff. I could no longer commit as much time as I needed to to say Yep. This is currently how good I am. I realized that even the performance was putting out what below what I could be doing. I was like, I'm done. Yeah. I don't want to be doing this if I can't  As good as I could possibly be. I think that's such a commendable cold to make though and I think that so many people would just like flog a dead fucking horse. No, no be like, I'm injured. I'm fat. I'm just going to keep going I'm just gonna keep going but like, you know, and there's always people out there who are going to be like, oh, you're so brave your so, you know and admire that but really it is that an admirable attitude to have like, yeah, like the fact that you're doing something a lot less Pleasant. Even you were you could be  Kissing the energy onto something else, you know, the slang doesn't work with your life anymore and you you've tried and it doesn't work. Yeah move the fuck away. I'm a dead horse blogger from way back. That's a different item attitude, right because you'll still improving. Well, I just feel and it's been in a lot of areas of my life like it's been in relationships and jobs and Sport like everything where I'm like, no I got to keep going. I've got to make this work. We've got to make this work and I just like keep trying and trying and trying when like the  Time I've got this gut feeling that I'm like maybe you just need to move on that to me like moving on is giving us giving up. Yeah, and I guess sometimes like giving up is the brave thing to do but I think that you know, we've got this mindset as like a culture and you know, all these inspiring stories around them is like, oh they just kept trying and they just keep trying and they got yeah, you know, they've got through all this shit in what they got with a one of them in but it's like whoa, give it some times.  You may be trying to shouldn't have thing. Maybe you should have just fucking stopped. Yeah, you know, yeah, and I don't think that every single time. It's like you're supposed literally supposed to keep trying until you spoke and I not like definitely not. Yeah, but let's degrees, right? So for example, like with your lifting we know you've got to dodge elbow. So it's going to take a lot of work to get it to a position where it's actually giving you the numbers you wanted to but I think that's a productive type of plugging away at something. Yeah, because there's Improvement. It's not measurable the sense of like bigger jerks the platform.  Time you come out but it looks better. It's more consistent more solid all those things. So like as long as you've got a degree of movement in the right direction keep flogging that horse. Ya soon as you start falling backwards no matter what the fuck you're doing. It's not worth it. And that was my lifting. I was getting heavier. I was getting weaker and I was getting more mentally unstable, I guess because of the stress associated with not performing that I was like am literally about to go backwards and I know it and I can feel  It I want to quit before it happens on the platform. So quitting while you're ahead. Basically, yeah would be the lesson. Yeah. Yeah, like I admire people that play tennis on into the 40s and like forth the rankings whatever but also admire like the number one retiree. Yeah. I definitely think there's enter and also sitting yourself a limit right? Like I'm going to do this last comp. Yep. That's going to be my last go did I'm done. Yep, and I mean you're always going to have always going to be questions.  And what ifs and people giving their like unwanted opinion 50 cents worth? Yeah. I know it's half a dollar fuck off.  Spit like across it Anyway by Y. And also why do you care like because they want you to validate their choices. Yeah, and I just don't see how you can put that on to somebody like this their choice their sport what they choose to do with their time, whatever weight class their own whatever they want to do like that's up to them focus on your own shit. Yeah. Everyone wants to be validated by reference to someone else's choices. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. They want to hear that you regret it because they want to hear that. They should continue.  You you know all that shit. Yeah, like somehow your path is relevant to this is where it's really gone. Yeah you overheard.  Yeah fuck right. Well, it's getting rid of date. Yeah, see, how does it have a good dig around you? Like what are we gonna talk about? I'm like, wow, you know balance big dick energy. Yeah. I love her and somehow drag it out to like yeah 45 minutes. She's a great now de Duke Energy is a it's definitely a Vibe and it'll or it's actually also really really tricky because you start thinking about the gendered aspects of it. Yeah. Like I noticed this real bad in first year. We had a mediation exercise. We've got like two teams of three people.  On other sides of the desk you both have a client in mind a client has goals obviously and they're opposed obviously, so you have to come to a position in the middle and I realized that of the group of like six people talking one of the girls on my side said not a single thing because her way of communicating was different because I'm obviously big and loud and up front and quite forward you can say she was the opposite Shadow really really quiet.  I'm not going to say submissive but didn't mean your to of demeanor. I suppose you could say she was quite small and person quite small and voice and extremely extremely patient and waiting for a gap in the conversation to include a condo you to kind of Barrel on in there didn't it didn't fucking work and I'm like make the rest of our industry are people like this people with opinions who think they know the right thing unless you can shove yourself in you will not be there. You will not be at the table next time and like I spoke to her afterwards privately.  fantastic ideas  awesome initiatives like all of these really really balanced solutions that should have been on the table. But because she didn't come with the big dick energy that the people around her brought. It just got swept under. Yeah, so does not have fucking good you are unless you're there and your present and your you know, you suck your claws in what the fuck's it full. So again stuck your dick in consensually, obviously, is it as big dick energy like I guess is it a personality trait? Whereas like  You don't have it. Well, I didn't I didn't think I've always had it to be honest. Yes. I think I just as I've gotten older I've just given less and less Sparks. Yep, basically and I guess come to accept that like not everyone's going to like me whatever. Yeah, you know and that's okay and I'm not going to try and change that but I'm not going to also change how I am because of that. I think he cultivated. I think you definitely cultivate it. We also have to be quite sensible to where it isn't isn't  appropriate like having a banner now swearing liberally all of that. That's very much me and my like, you know out of work hours because at work conservative profession a lot of the people who I admire in the profession are of a different generation with a very different set of like yeah life values and what they think is appropriate. So the way you communicate really has to depend on the audience like bantering with my sports Mates is one thing talking with the judge is another of course, and so the big dick energy, it's appropriate.  Situation is very very different. So I definitely told myself down a lot informal a professional context because I know that that attitude does not translate well in a professional space, but you can still maintain a level of big dick energy without swearing and push out being aggressive. Well Cross or crude oil crude, it's just about being like I'm owning my opinion. I deserve to be here like heaven.  A presence like you said? Yeah, and I don't think that is necessarily accompanied by swearing or talkin about dicks, but I can't but I can't because Unapologetic as fuck. No it is it is just definitely I think it's a learned attitude and it's learned by watching people you admire. Yeah, definitely and I think that the more people you surround yourself with who do have this kind of level of self-confidence the more it's like you feel okay to be more confident showing opinion.  Sure, I can definitely notice since like and the friendship group that I kind of have now people to hang out with now like all of the women in my life a very strong very assertive and they're always kind yeah and supportive. Yeah, they're not mean people but I know that if I did something to piss one of them off that tell me he'd hear about it about it and the same vein I would let them know if you know what I mean, so, I think it's more about  About just like being confident with who you are. And I think that's a really really productive way for women to engage because growing up like you got that High School caddy bullshit wherever I'm super super nice on the surface, but actually they're all bitching about everyone else and that fucking attitude people carry into adult life and I'm not here for it. I'm into women that you fucked me off when you did this.  Can we move pasta or is this a deal breaker for our relationship? Yeah, exactly and having those honest conversations and being okay with someone saying to you how you sit there and it annoyed me and you being like I'm really sorry. Let's let's work. Let's go. Let's not just sweep it under the rug and your bitch about it to the behind. Yep. Yeah. Well, that's why I believe in confrontation confrontation because having big dick energy means that you are confronting and you're prepared to be confronted. Yeah, you should  Surround yourselves. Yeah, you guys need to be calling everyone on this shit and then like lose the plot when somebody addresses you absolutely you've done. Absolutely I think also in terms of like romantic relationships. It's really hard because I know growing up. I mean I'm a bit older than you but it was all you're always kind of like being like, I guess More Meek and having that kind of submissive sorted by was kind of what guys liked it.  A guy didn't really want a woman who was going to be like should a fucking parks there. Yeah. Yeah. It was right there. Yeah. Do you open pocket for you to be fair? All my partners in their drivers to me? That's a separate issue, but not tiny actually had and sometimes I regressed back into that. Yeah have your pattern and I've noticed it and I'm like, oh gross like the other day like my boyfriend was driving as and you know, I'm very conscious of when  Vanessa's driving not to be like the backseat Drive. Yeah, because it's irritating. Yeah, right. Just trying to find a pot and I swear had driven past like three Parks but didn't say anything because I was like, well, he knows what he's doing. He's driving I would just let him know just didn't make the call. Right? So we packed fucking miles away and you're like Sissy think about it walking back in this tray and he's like, oh, there's like three parts right here. You like not really a fucking dog hunts. I guess I could and he's like, what the fuck?  I thought you wanted to park far away and he was like, oh my God, what is wrong with you? Yeah, it was like, yeah, it was wrong with me. Why didn't I just feel like Madison Park? Yeah like but there's also distinctly compromise, right? You second-guess yourself, you know, I found that I've been doing that a lot lately where I'll be like am I being micromanaging? I am I you know, am I being bossy and my being and I think I only question that when it's in like a romantic relationship because it was in the workplace. I'm like damn right? I'm being bossy. I'm the boss. Yeah, you know.  Yeah, I'm gonna tell that person to move off. My platform is my platform. Yeah. Yeah for sure because I'd the repercussions don't concern me. Like if someone's going to get annoyed that I've liked told them what to do it work. I don't care because that's my job. Yeah, someone's going to get annoyed because I told me with my platform. I don't care. It's my platform. And yeah, no, I got some reason when it's in a romantic context. There's a lot of fear around although they're going to think I'm bossy. They're gonna think I'm psycho that going to think XYZ are not giving them enough space to be with them or whatever.  So I tend to like regress to this like less of this like small smaller dick. Yep version of myself, I get that and like hard because I tend to have the exact same thoughts of the partner, but for me it often comes down to I know my greatest strength, but also my biggest relationship weakness is that I am highly neurotic. Oh my God that don't fuck with my sleep. I know exactly what I want to eat. Yes, like  A lot of ways, I'm very particular. I don't want to sleep at your house. I want to sleep in my house. Yeah, because I have three things to do tomorrow and I don't want to think about packing my bag for three things plus overnight was sleeping in mind or we're not just fuck. This is me, right and I'm sleeping over I'm bringing my laptop. Yep, because he'll sleep in. Yeah, and I know that I'm going to get up at 6:00 and I'm going to want to do some work. Yep. So I'll bring my laptop. Yeah arouse I'm not fucking sleeping over because I'm not going to lie there look at the sink if they're like, yeah, it's not get that, you know, so like being neurotic is  really hard because like I know I'm neurotic and I know that you know, I need to have dinner by 7 p.m. And I need to know what I'm eating. Yeah, there's no surprise food. Yeah surprise times for meals. Yeah, let's like spontaneous. So let's just go do this. No, I agree. So it is it's hard in a sense because you have to try and like back that off a little bit because it is intimidating for most people more. They also want they don't have to live your neurotic life and you want to respect your partner's right to be a normal human. Yeah, and you do  Like a thing because it matters to you. Yeah, I got that. I know it's really hot. But the other thing is, right. It also depends on the personality match because I had a really good role model in my mother because my mother was extremely neurotic and extremely particular that's actually raised me. And now that we've got our stepdad he is just an absolute gem. He's like this enormous Canadian, you know, he's awesome used to be an elite athlete whatever but he's very much a yes dear man in the sense that I'm relaxed. I don't care.  She's particular weed or her away because it makes her happy really do need to have that balance in a relationship. And I first I thought it was a bit weird because it's like she can be extremely unreasonable. So yes during all the time from an outside perspective looks really weird, but then I met his whole group of friends and all the couples are like that the wives like these tiger moms that are super neurotic and Sue particular husband's like these incredible gentle men that I yes dear most of the time because they just love you so much that they're like if you need to be  Eating by 701 we will eat at 7:01. I will bring it to work if necessary like that survived and I think that's sort of relationship balance your ultimately looking for because we have two highly neurotic highly specific people the chances that you meet on the particular things in your erotic about our 0. Yeah, like I've dated athlete it doesn't fucking work because you've got your sleep schedule. They've got theirs their meals are your meals and ultimately you coexist you don't exist like as a unit. Yeah, where's one one of the partners is relaxed and they're in it because they love  View you have the space to be neurotic psycho. I think that's the best sort of balance. Yeah, I think that's kind of what I've realized rather than trying to find a partner who's neurotic about the same things not too hard because yeah, you just end up pressing each other off. Yep, because you're so unreasonable in this your clothes on reasonable and unreasonable Latif. Yeah, just like a fucking constant so we fight we did X obviously agree with you which is why I just need to find a partner. That's very very different to  Yeah, and that's the most successful relationships. I've had one. My partner is like objectively not as high achieving because they don't tick off the same sort of bullshit that I took off, but they're incredibly impressive person loving smart all those things. They just a lot less psycho. Yeah, and I think that's the only way it can work. Yeah. I feel like I need someone who makes up for like all of those things that my personality is lacking. Yeah, that's what it is. Right. You meant to complement each other not like hit the same mouth.  All Stones. Yeah, I know Dad. It's pretty cool that you already realized that I feel like it's taking me fucking years. It took some soul-searching. Yeah, I know right? But yeah hmm. We're having our so that's the main thing. Yeah, right. Well, I should so fucking hard. We should do like a whole separate podcast on them exhales gonna I have got one planned with Tom and Siobhan because they're both in on my podcast and there are a couple cool. Obviously we got to talk.  Relationship. Yeah, it'd be great. Hi functioning people in relationships. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, but I mean basically we just living out this time functioning lives. Yeah. I'm just trying to add a human to it my God, that's so accurate. Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely like when you said something's got to give that's exactly it. When you bring a relationship in it's got to be a really really aggressive reprioritization. Does this relationship with this human matter enough to me that I'm prepared to take some pegs off my goals  And because don't delude yourself and thinking before the high level plus adding a human that you care about into the mix. Yeah, that's not a thing. So which is why relationships I think to me into your so critical because you've got to be really fucking worth it for me to fuck with my sleep take pegs off. My study all those things. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And I guess that's all we're doing right as we just try to find that person is worth it. Yeah, which is hard because you're always busy and you're not dating you not drinking.  And we all know you don't fuck someone at the gym. No, no bad bad choice bad choice really but it has a there that's right moving on moving on. Yeah. Yeah. So if you got any last minute mind gold for our many fans out there any quotes any Little Gems of wisdom that you can offer actually fucking in bring it with me, but there's a book that I want everyone to read it some buffer All Blacks what the fuck's apart.  I've realized swear. It's about sweeping the shit. Yeah, um fuck, you know, fuck it up like he talking. Yeah, you jabbering. Basically, I'm good at that.  It's about I guess I learned from it. It's a lot about how to leave how to how to be a good leader and making sure that you're doing like the the most menial tasks that you're requiring someone to do it. You're doing it yourself basically and it is called Legacy and is by James Kerr. Yes. I have read that. It's fun and incredible of books that use Sports as an analogy and I guess it's relevant to you. Even if you don't do a sport because it is literally just that it's an analogy well,  So about a high-performance mindset and like anything you take like the sweeping the sheds thing the idea is that the captains at the end of a game will sweep out the warm-up room because football cleats obviously rugby cleats kick off a lot of grass. And so the code the captain's will sweep the shed the warm-up room after the team has departed just show that the leaders aren't above it. The leaders are in the trenches with you and that's a really really important aspect of leadership and like every other anecdote or quote they put in  They're some of my translate from already. Obviously, some of them are just straight up English and they all convey a lesson about leadership or teamwork or all these important high-performance attitude things that just fucking mutter and sport is just such a pithy analogy because it's easy to understand. Yeah, and it's so much about teamwork and and all that all that stuff that we can apply to a lot as basically. Yeah. Sure. I suppose the only like mine gold thing to depart with is that increasingly because I've hit the ripe old age of 25.  I'm starting to have more conversations with people around me about not stalling because it's really really easy to be like full steam ahead. When you're sixteen Seventeen eighteen. Do your sports doing a high school. You do your degree start your career. I've been smoking crack in the toilet the high-performance - that later I did we're talking about like life is that have like always, you know gun for shit and you hit the age of 25 you finish your degree and you started your job and you just stagnate as fuck because you're tired. You've ticked things off you're done.  Done and like having that transition from gunung all the time to being an adult try to have a life and a social life and a partner and whatever that point of possible stagnation had a big through that had a lot of conversations people have bad that like pick up a language never stop learning pick something and make sure you're good at it because if your job is not fulfilling you pick a sport doesn't fucking matter what one and I think something I has always spoken to me. There's a Sylvia Plath quote literally looks it up before because I always butcher it it reads what  See most is the idea of being useless. Well educated brilliantly promising and fading out into an a different middle age. So guys go find bona fide. I can do that. It's amazing. Oh, that's beautiful. Did you take it off all of these things? And you hit 40 and what have you done for? The last decade? Yeah fucking hell. Yeah. It's amazing just tokens then a no offense. Yeah, no offense intended made that choice, but that's what I mean. Like, I think that's a mine gold.  I want everyone to take away never stop moving forward and it doesn't matter if you re adjust your goals, but have a fucking good reason for it. I Quit sport so I could focus on law so I can stop having an out for not hitting that cherry. This is an excuse for me to start, you know, fucking around doing nothing. It's if you've committed to it do it and if you don't have a really good reason for it don't just become mediocre and look back on all the things you could have should have done.  That's fucking beautiful. Thank you so much. You're an absolute treasure on my it's been a pleasure no matter what you do whether you decide to come back to weightlifting with you decide to do if I can bodypump. You got to be fucking good at it maybe spin class. I need to take a legs and thank you so much Graham, and I have enjoyed your company immensely. It's been my pleasure. You're a legend. Thank you. Have a good day. Everyone. Bye.
I want to talk about The Black Keys they were on Joe Rogan the other day and I think maybe Friday they release this interview. I don't know when they did it. But my God, they were great. You know, I don't I feel like it's very uncommon for radio shows and Vlogs and things to plug other things with Joe Rogan is just downright magnificent and I don't want to throw and this isn't an insult because you know, Jim.  Me Fallon has been wonderful to us, you know, he came and hung with us that record store day and did our show and he was so lovely. So this is not a Slam against him. But you know and Stephen Colbert seems like a nice fella and Jimmy Kimmel. They're all they're all lovely. They're all wonderful. But I feel like Joe Rogan is the new Tonight Show, you know all the information all the the entertainment.  I just you know that excitement that you used to get when you were tuning in to Johnny Carson when you are tuning into early Letterman, you know, it's so 4matic now on these late shows and it's not another host fault. I think we just kind of got there but Rogen is so exciting and great. Anyway, he had the Black Keys on and the interview is fantastic. I really really enjoyed it.  And a couple things that they spoke about which I found pretty interesting going back to our, you know, Woodstock getting canceled thing. They shed a little light on that and then they talked about Lil Wayne and big Wayne and I want to share that with you, but we'll start with the Woodstock that where you know, they were talking about we had speculated on them and what was happening with the black keys because you know, they were early to cancel the  Festival and as it turns out of the time they canceled the festival they already had an inkling that it was going to be canceled. You'll hear that in the conversation between The Black Keys here and Joe Rogan. It starts with the guys sort of talking about festivals to begin with and you know, the Black Keys have gotten so big why do they even play festivals, you know anymore anyway, and they will that's when they  I brought up the whole Woodstock thing which we pulled on a Woodstock for that for that reason for that reason because we didn't want that to be our first show back in four and a half years. Hmm. It was more money than we'd ever been paid for show our age. I was like what you sure you want to cancel it. We had taken four days of him check in with you. Sure. We're like wow cancel it. It's a it's not going to be cool be  I want to play that as our first show back and he's like, well, there's a good chance. It's going to get cancelled. And if you cancel it, you're not going to get paid. I think why would we want to headline a festival gets cancelled? Like makes us look like we can't yeah funny. Is that why we want to headline a festival that gets cancelled. It's a good point. I will say that Patrick Carney did a majority of the talking, I believe because Dan Auerbach was on a previous episode so Dan and kind of just sat back and let Patrick do a lot of the talking he is.  Credibly cool. Like I was really taken aback by him and captivated by what he had to say. You know, I mean, he was just endlessly entertaining he did this whole thing about Spotify and everything and talked about the pay breakdown and I want to get into that one day too. They will say that for tomorrow. I don't know because there's just so much to unpack there and he cursed a lot. So it takes a long time to clean that up. But anyway on the idea of festivals the black he's brought up.  The last Festival that they're going to wind up probably playing was it happened this past Saturday in Vegas and they were slotted behind Lil Wayne and it wasn't the first time that the Black Keys were slightly behind Little Lane. In fact, the last time that they had this situation happen Lil Wayne wound up showing up way late took the stage. When the Black Keys are supposed to take the stage did his whole set gets off in The Black Keys only had time to play three songs before they had to leave, you know.  Cuz the festival had in heart out. So the Black Keys prepared for the little Wayne scenario this time around we pick up the conversation there.  Lil Wayne is going on before us which isn't the first time that's happened. That's a good story. I will till I like him see ya I would never met a person whose music is cool, but we've got big Wayne to come out with us afterward. Oh, okay. Wait Wayne Newton. Oh no. Yeah, we lay in Vegas like we got Lil Wayne before us we have to have big weigh-in with us. So we booked that Wayne Newton. Is he going to sing a song? He's gonna sing along the way the only boy, holy shit.  And sure enough this past Saturday in Vegas The Black Keys brought out little brought out big Wayne Wayne Newton and he's saying Lonely Boy with them.  Wayne sounds good.  Because it sounds exactly like Dan Auerbach to in a strange way. But obviously the biggest crowd that's Wayne's that's that's home court advantage right there. People lost their minds to see him. We have a full-length shot of you know fan shot footage of that that will put links up on the morning show with Anthony Vlog page. So you guys can go and check that out.

Have fun.  And hello to everyone recovering from your freaky weekend. This is not even days with your favorite Nadia's mommy episode 3, no boys allowed. If you've been following the gram, you know what this podcast is all about y'all if you want to participate in the show. All you got to do is follow me on the IG @ not a mommy not the we take polls. You can send me some stories ask some questions. It's all Anonymous. I do want to say that I'm extremely grateful for the amount of feedback.  And Views that have been getting and the past few weeks. We are way over 250 listens. I did tell myself it's crazy because I told myself in the beginning if I would get at least 10 listens, I would continue to do this podcast and I look at the numbers now and they climb every day. So I do want to say thank you. You can send me continue to send me your stories. You send me your stories ask me questions. We do take polls on the IG. It's at not a mommy. Not the  And aty and it is a judgment-free Zone. This podcast is place. This space is for mommy's to talk about all the noughties things they do but there aren't supposed to talk about this episode. No boys allowed. I'm not really sure if you know what the gist of this episode is, but we are going to tone it down a bit. So it's going to be me myself and I this episode Pretty solo and that is because this episode is all about the art of negotiation.  supination and the reason I said, no boys allowed isn't because I don't think boys should listen it actually would probably be better if they do but I think because the art of masturbation is very different between a man and a female between I guess I mean between a penis and a pussy it is very different for guys, you know, they pretty much just stroke until they reach satisfaction, but for girls for ladies, it's all about  timing and instruments and techniques and it's just a lot of different things that you need to reach the Big O and what you're really looking for. So today we are going to get really personal with one another because it is about you and it's about you basically just trying things with yourself and being comfortable with your own self as far as stimulating yourself touching playing and you know,  At the end of the day just reaching an explosive orgasm because that's pretty much what we're all after when we want to feel good. And when you know, the mood is striking and we're ready to just be with ourselves, which is totally okay and totally normal. We're going to go ahead and go into some poles and some DM's and at the end. I have a top secret tip that I do want to give all of my ladies and again boys are very welcome to listen to the show.  But nor friends, I don't want your feedback. This is all about my girls and about my girls feeling good about themselves and just kind of getting into it with themselves because to be honest, you can't tell somebody else how to satisfy you. If you don't know how to satisfy yourself. So you definitely should look at yourself. You definitely should know what you look like what you actually like what feels good and we're going to go into that later. So we're going to go into poles. I did two poles on my  IG this week, let's see. So the poles that I did the first one was do you masturbate for a long time? I had a hundred percent of do you masturbate but now I was at my ending pole was 94% Yes. I love me 6% know I don't touch so there are a lot of people I mean not a whole lot of people but there definitely are people out there that still don't want to touch themselves whether I'm not sure whether it's comfort.  Ability a comfort thing maybe Comfort level or it's just something where they're just not into it. And again every topic we talked about it's not for everybody. Sometimes people are inter certain things. Sometimes people may be into it. They don't know they're into it. So they just kind of like hear about it. But as far as masturbating not everybody masturbates, so that was a little surprising to see because again, it wasn't a hundred percent for a while the second Pole.  Is how many times do you masturbate per month? I had 71% said more than five times and 29% said less than five times. So pretty interesting number. I thought five times was pretty significant five times average two more than once a week for a month. So I thought that was pretty significant, but there are people out here they got nothing else to do but play with themselves and I wish I had that much time to do more than  five times a month and we'll go ahead and go again. We'll go more into that. But why did have somebody that actually wrote me telling me that it's like five times a week for her. So there's definitely people that are way more active with themselves. And again more power to I wish I had the time to reach five self orgasmic experiences at least a week. That would be great. So with our poles that that's what we went over. We wanted to see if people everybody  Masturbating out there. We wanted to see if this is something people want to talk about. I did get a lot of responses to my poles whether they you know, wanted to participate in the vote or not, but I did get responses in my DMs about the polls saying oh my God, this is something super personal. Oh my God. Are you really going to be talking about this? And you know, I just want to make it something to wear girls and women are comfortable to talk about because again, you know for women as we are doing  Doing and you know things to ourselves and touching ourselves and you know trying to get against the Big O as you're trying to get to this it's it's all in the mind frame. You've got to be there with yourself and you got that hundred percent be comfortable with yourself. If you know, you don't want to reach a point where you feel bad about trying something or doing something and I mean this is you at the end of the day you are the one that knows everything about yourself. So why not know everything?  About your physical self as well. And you know, I again am all you know for this topic because I think it's very important that you know your own body before anybody else does so I think it's important that you know, what you like and what you don't like and again just like every topic we talked about it's all about being comfortable. It's all about being comfortable with, you know yourself and what you like to do, so that's why I wanted to kind of tone it down a little bit.  Bit and I'm going to be here with you solo dolo and we're just going to go through it together. And so that way you can feel that this is really about you and you can feel comfortable talking about it thinking about it doing it because again, it could be something that it's I mean not only is it really healthy for you, but it could be something that is fun for you. So I did get some DM so we can go through one of the DM's was it was I guess it was kind of like a question again.  So again, you could DME stories questions advice topics, whatever you want to talk about. I have people di Meo King talked about this talked about that. You know, I'm going to try to mention everybody that I can that allows me to again all confidential judgment free, but go ahead and feel free to DME whatever you like. So this person yeah me about Tory's versus versus fingers. So toys would be vibrated dildos.  Hello, Teddy Bears showerhead eyes. These are the different kinds of toys that you can use to go ahead and pleasure yourself. And yeah, I mean, I'm sure maybe if you ever seen the movie or anything like that, you can look up in a porno but girls do you use pillows and teddy bears and shower heads and things that are different than just your average vibrator and dildo and you know things that you could buy in a sex store. I mean there are different things that you can use different.  There is and different things that you can use to pleasure yourself. So it was toys vs. Fingers. Now, if you're asking my personal opinion, I am cool with toys and everything like that, but I am really about fingers. I feel like when you have skin to skin contact, even if it is with yourself, you can actually feel what you like. And what is going on versus whatever the texture of the toy that  You're using so I am always choosing fingers over toys. I would always choose fingers over toys. Also, I think with fingers you can get to know your spots better. You can get to know your body better. You can kind of touch all over and not for nothing. But when you're with somebody else for the most part, they're probably going to use their fingers. I need toys again could definitely be involved, but you're mostly going to get finger action so you can really have that.  Into skin kind of connection even if it is with yourself. So I like fingers personally. I like fingers. I just you know, there's just more that you can feel you can go on top. You can go inside you can kind of play around so I think fingers are just more sensual now, you can definitely use toys. I'm all about are, you know, I've used towards myself. Obviously, I mean most girls that have masturbated do use toys so  You can use toys and vibrators and dildos come in all shapes and sizes. You can literally buy vibrators that are a small as like a lipstick or smaller or you buy huge ones dildos same way. You could buy some that stick onto the wall. You can buy some that have really like texture like a real penis. You could buy some that are you know glass or ceramic so dildos the same there they come in all shapes and sizes a pillow is very interesting.  You know, really you can use the pillow off your bed. I guess. I mean, I would wash it afterwards but you can use the pillow off your bed. It's soft. It's you know, I'm not gonna say I'm never used that before but it's not my go-to I guess but I think that's also when you're a little bit younger you kind of want to seal see different textures and what things feel like so I'm not gonna say I've never used a pillow or teddy bear or showerhead vibrating dildo or any other toy before because  Was pretty much have used all of his tours at some point. But if you're asking me toys vs. Fingers, I definitely say fingers. I just think you know with the with fingers you get again the skin to skin contact and also you can kind of feel yourself if you don't like the feeling of it because it's not for everybody. If you don't like the feeling of feeling yourself get wet, or you know, if you do have your orgasm it's obviously going to be feeling differently if you don't like that face.  That kind of feeling than toys is definitely more for you. But if you're asking me fingers all the way my next CM was about so is it just me or am I hornier after my 30s now? I totally think yes, I think once you hit your 30s, you're just in a different level of horniness. I'm not saying your twenties. You're not horny. I think your 20s. Yes. You want to pretty much hump anything that comes in your path.  But I think when you hit your 30s, it's more about feeling different kinds of pleasures and you're willing to try more things. You kind of want to do it more often. Like I said, there was a lot of you know, a lot of different females that told me that you know, it's definitely way more than five. So five per month is what I asked him. I polls and I had female telling me it was way more than five per month times that they go ahead and masturbate.  So, you know, there's that's a lot of time that you find to yourself and as especially as moms it's hard to find that time where you're completely alone because if you're with a spouse or if you have kids or if there's anybody in your house, really you you want a loan time for this type of activity. You don't want someone to knock on the door. You don't want to feel like there's someone in the house and it's kind of hard to get that alone time. So I definitely think you know, I guess after  for your 30s, I guess because it is harder to get that alone time that might be adding to the sexual tension and why you feel hornier and I mean, yeah hornier after your 30s a thousand percent. I'm in my lower 30s, but I'm definitely still a lot hornier than I was a few, you know a few years ago.  Sorry, if I'm drinking a little bit more water. I'm actually recovering from a cold guys and I'm still here giving you a hundred percent. So yeah, definitely horny after my 30s and I love her near to another thing that I've noticed after my 30s is I'm kind of more into watching porn now than I was in my 20s. I don't know if in my 20s it's like more taboo or anything, but in my 30s, I'm kind of more into it. Like I don't know I definitely  Horny or watching porn. I'm not saying I sit there in my room all day and watch porn. But if I find the time where I'm by myself and I'm like, you know how this time I myself I kind of want to reach an orgasm and maybe take a nap. I would definitely watch a little bit of porn and kind of get yourself going on because it has whatever you want. You can pretty much look up whatever kind of porn you're into but I just think also it just kind of, you know, it's different things to watch or if you're  Not until watching porn because you know, it's if you don't want to see all of that maybe recording yourself that too. It's a good good thing to do because one you can send it to whoever you want to send it to you want to go ahead and do that or you can watch it yourself leader and you can play with yourself while you're watching it. Now. I've never really done anything like that. But by all means, you know, you could definitely do something like that. It's an idea for you. Maybe you can record yourself.  Laughing you and your spouse can watch it together, you know, whatever it is that you guys I guess could incorporate the whole fingers to vagina activity. You can go ahead and do that and that being pretty much leads me into my next TM. They also send me how about boyfriend girlfriend getting involved. So basically you start by yourself and they go ahead and your significant other.  Gets involved now again, I usually this is something I usually do when I'm by myself like alone in my house nobody's home because I just don't want to be bothered but if you're down for it, maybe your man is sleeping next to you and he's already passed out and you kind of just want to do it yourself nothing that's never happened before. So if you're down for that's totally cool and maybe when you're halfway through you can kind of wake him up and I mean he can get involved you guys can do it next.  Sue each other you can watch each other do it you can just start up by like I said by yourself and maybe you can just sit on his face, you know, whatever it is you want to do but when it comes to masturbating and when it comes to kind of touching yourself and pleasing yourself you I'm not saying you can't get your significant other involved but Thatcher's leads to obviously either getting fingered or getting more sex, right? So that's pretty much what you  What you want from them? I think when it actually comes to a moment of you having that moment with yourself and touching yourself and just feeling yourself and making yourself feel good. I do think it's the best part of it. All is being so low. I think the best part of it is just releasing that built up sexual tension that you have. It allows you to fantasize. It allows you to fantasize maybe about things that you haven't really thought of  For or maybe things you think of and you think that you couldn't bring up to your significant other for whatever reason, maybe you're not really comfortable about talking to him yet about it or her yet, but you want to fantasize about it. And that's really, you know, something you can do to kind of spice up that moment.  Sorry take another sip of water, but that's really something you could do to spice up that moment is you know, fantasize about different things you want to do or maybe different things you want to try or maybe things you really never want to do and try but you like to think about maybe something you've seen in a porno me something scene in a movie maybe something you've had a dream about but I do think that again with the CM of you know, trying to get my boyfriend or girlfriend involved. Yeah.  It's totally cool, but it will lead up to another sexual experience what I want to talk about. What I'm really getting into is you just being comfortable with yourself and for me the best part about masturbating or the best part about touching yourself for the best part about you know, feeling yourself is you just having that Comfort level that for a moment, you know, no matter what it is. No one is judging what you want to do with yourself and there's  Lee different things that you can do, you know, you could still use toys on yourself. You can still touch yourself that's not straight to there. You can touch your boobs. You can play with your nipples. You can touch your stomach you can touch your hair. You can still touch yourself in sensual ways and kind of just get yourself going and part inner part of your thigh. I'm you know, you can do all of that as well to kind of get yourself to that moment of wanting to go ahead and just start, you know playing with  Yourself and kind of just feeling around now I this type of show has never been the type of show that is about research and I'm not here to tell you what a vagina looks like anything like that like no we're grown women at this point. If you haven't taken a mirror to your vagina, I highly suggest you do at some point in your life. As soon as you finish this podcast take a mirror. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. It's okay to look at yourself. We are built to  with this thing and take a mirror examine yourself know what it looks like research the body parts. That's not what this podcast is about what this show is about with this episode specifically is about is just you wanting to feel comfortable about talking about it because it's totally okay to talk about it. But even if you don't want to talk about it, even if this stays here and this stays in my DM and we never talk about toys vs. Fingers or if you're horny or after.  Ruiz or if your boyfriend even if we never talked about any of those things or you never want to talk about any of those things again, it's really about you just being with yourself and just knowing that it is okay to be with yourself and try new things and it is okay to watch porn that maybe you're never going to do but you want to see it it is okay to fantasize is okay to fantasize about having a crazy cheating session and you're never acting on it. It's okay.  Okay, because in this moment you are by yourself and you're with yourself and I do think it's a whole like sexual process of a woman and a female really achieving like a fulfilling experience while they are masturbating. It's more than just like a before-and-after. It's like during that moment that you are touching yourself that you are allowed to be in complete control of your own body. You know, you're a lot of tell your own body what you want how you want.  On it how you want to get to it? You're allowed to close your eyes. You're allowed to touch your body your a lot of look in the mirror. I mean, there's really so many ways that you can really just touch yourself in pleasure yourself. And in this moment, this is why I say, you know when you are going to really get sensual with yourself. I think you need to be completely by yourself. It's cool to get your man involved as quota get your significant other.  Involved but there's something about being with yourself, especially when your mom or you have a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever it is. It's those even if it's 10 minutes it even if it's 10 minutes and they're at Publix going grocery shopping when you're by yourself for those few minutes. It really allows you to just have control of whatever you want as a mom as a woman in general. We're always concerned about everybody else. This is a time for you to be concerned about  Own body. So going back to my poles for those. What was it six percent? It said for those six percent that are like no. No, I don't want to touch if it's something where you're just like it was just not my thing fine. But if it's something that you still think about it, but just haven't reached that moment yet girl find Time - yourself and even if you don't go all the way touching yourself and certain your  fingers in yourself putting a vibrator even if you don't go all the way just touch yourself and just feel yourself and feeling control of your body because to really get you know, really great orgasms and have a really good time with yourself with your spouse with whoever it's all about knowing what your points are. You know with the what point in your body really gets you going and that is what I really want to you know promote for you in  You know, so because of that I usually like I said, I usually don't do research. I usually don't bring like scientific facts in here because that's not what I'm about. I'm not your science teacher. I'm not going to teach you about the anatomy of a pussy. I want you to know your own body but different ways for you to reach your orgasm, right? We have I looked up a few articles, but there was one article that stuck out it was health line.  Dot-com you can look it up. If you want. It was basically all about the female orgasm and female masturbation and I went into different, you know, different details which again you could look it up but there was a chart that says orgasm type and type A masturbation. So if you want an orgasm through your clitoris, right, this is what it says, most people use their fingers to play with the clitoris but vibrators and other toys can also bring pleasure during solo play when you  Guys, I'm you'll feel a tingling sensation along your skin and in your brain. So when you want to orgasm through the clitoris, that's basically obviously on top you're going to go ahead vibrators. It says vibrators and toys are the best and that's going to give you that tingling kind of orgasm. So if that's what the orgasm you're reaching for or if that's the kind of toys you want to use. It says that that's going to be the ideal orgasm for your vibrators. And your toys is when you you know play around  and with your Clips, the next type of orgasm is vaginal and it says you can use your fingers or sex story to penetrate your vagina during solo play. You'll feel the Big O deeper in your body and your vaginal walls will throb this is basically  Yeah, this is sticky icky play. This is the point when you're basically touching yourself and you're going inside you're starting to penetrate your yourself. So fingers are in girl. And you're in there you're feeling around is definitely you know, what at this point but this type of orgasm is going to make your vagina walls for Rob. So this type of or so with clitoris orgasm you're looking for more of a tingling sensation more that vibration.  Is what that's going to bring with a vaginal orgasm your penetrating. So you're feeling juices. You're feeling all of your squishiness in there. And it's going to be once you do orgasm. It will make your vagina walls throb. I mean, that sounds great. So the next one says next organism type is anal. And what is says this is the type of masturbation you can use your fingers or sex toy for anal play although a toys.  Is better for deeper penetration right before you orgasm you may feel an intense need to pee only the contractions are around your anal sphincter. Okay. So basically  Again, this is you know, this is a different type of orgasm. This is orgasm in your anal.  And you would basically use your fingers or toy you can use you know, if you ever dildo vibrator. If you have anal beads, you can use all of that for yourself as well. But you can use your fingers or sex toy and the deeper you go. I guess the better it will be I haven't had an orgasm like that off of you know, but I really don't I personally don't masturbate with the you know, but, you know based off our anal show. We do have a lot of  People I do like email. So if you do like anal, you can try to go ahead and masturbate with some ass play. Okay combo. This is a combo. It says this one is all about personal preference. You can use both hands to play with your vagina and your clitoris or combo of sex toys and finger when you stimulate your Clint stimulate. Sorry when you stimulate your clitoris and vagina.  Especially the g spot at the same time, you'll feel an explosive orgasm. They made leave you convulsing or even leave to ejaculation. So this is what it's all about. You know, those girls are like our squirters. I mean again, I would be really cool if I can let that happen, but those girls that are squirters is says this is a personal preference you can use your hands to play. So basically you use your hands you play on the top of the clitoris.  But you also penetrate you also use a combo of toys and fingers. I mean, this is like this is like professional stuff, right? This is like the professional Shea this is when you're ready to like squirt all over your bed, you lay down a towel and you're ready to really get into it. I would suggest for this type of explosion. You probably want a good 20 minutes at home by yourself to come back from this but your day for you're definitely using the clitoris the Regina you  Looking for your G-spot girl, you're all about this. Okay, so it just gives some more tips about rubbing pinching tugging on your nipples your inner thighs your ears your neck. Basically just touching yourself. Like I was explaining earlier just make sure you know, it's not just your pussy that you have to touch but touching your whole body kind of gets you into the moment and also during touching your body. I mean nipples can get really sensitive. I mean things can definitely  Intensify your orgasm. So touching your body is that definitely definitely an important port thing and we reach the point where I promised you I would hook you up. So we reached a secret tip for an explosive orgasm. Just like I promise you I'm going to leave you with the tip now. I was a little surprised about this because I myself have not tried this but I am going to try this because apparently this is how you get to it ladies like apparently  the this is how you are going to reach the most intensified orgasm that you will have probably by yourself. I personally am a fan of laying down on my back. I like being on my back. I like being under the covers and kind of being alone. That's what I personally like. However, like I said, you can find a mirror you can find different ways to you know, try to to have that long time. Maybe you're in the shower.

You're listening to the classroom collaborative podcast with your hosts. Deedee wills and Brock and Adam Peterson who we are so glad you're here. Let's get started.  All right, welcome back to the show everybody. We're so so glad you're here joining us for episode number 2 DD. How are you? I'm super how are you? I'm doing awesome. It's great to talk to you again. And I'm so excited. This is one of those episodes that that I think whether people want to admit it or not. We all need to hear at some point, right? Yeah for sure. Yes. So today we're going to talk about our summers how we kind of re-energized ourselves decompress from a busy busy busy year even though summer is just as busy with family.  Friends and conferences, but more importantly how to take what you did over the summer to rejuvenate yourself as an educator and carry that into your classroom and find that ever so hard to find work life balance that is tough to do as an educator. Yeah. I mean, I really struggle with balance. Anyhow, it's you know, it's hard when you have the the demands from lots of different directions, right? So in the classroom, you have those demands  And then you have your own personal demands may be things that you want to accomplish personally and then you have family and then friends and I always feel like somebody's getting the short end of the stick. Like I can balance. I guess it's not really balance. Is it I like some things I for a while I could do put a lot of energy to one thing and something falls off and then I can refocus my energy and it goes into something else in that thing. I was really focused on can fall off and it's just a matter of trying  And to keep evening it out as much as you can and I think like social media makes it really hard right because that that temptation to compare is is so strong, especially with me. I maybe it's a girl thing. I don't know but I think that I guess I'm not a girl. I'm a full-grown individual like eight but you know the girl thing but you know the temptation to see you know, everybody can look perfect online can't they? You know, their Instagram feed looks.  Like oh they've got their act together. Well, you don't see like the hot mess behind them. And the same thing is true for teachers who are having their classroom presented online. Perhaps it makes it this pressure to constantly keep up. So what do you do when you get to the end of the school year, right and you're you're trying to kind of regain your sanity reintroduce yourself to your family members and pets right to life outside the four walls.  For sure. So Adam tell me some of the things that you did over the summer to kind of recharge your battery. Yeah, I agree with you that balance is tough. I think what you said said it better than the word balance that you said try to even things out because it's not about pouring everything into one thing for a while and then into something else is trying to find that even split among your passions. And yeah, I'm a big believer that if that passion and will family comes first with me family first, I think.  Is the way to go and everything but passion is right up there behind it and I try to fuel my my energy towards the things that I'm most passionate about this seem to have the most effect on other people besides my family. So yeah, I guess ending this year was a little bit different because this is my first year out of the classroom, so I didn't have the classroom to close down but I did help Trisha with hers for those of you listening to don't know. My wife is a second grade teacher. So I go to her classroom quite a bit and help out but we just try to decompress is the word we use because  So long of those nine-month school year we are go going whether it be for her and her students or both of us in our own kids with their rights and programs and everything that's going on. So for the first few weeks of summer, we try to stay pretty low-key whether it be traveling for a vacation, but keeping that Loki and relaxing or we have a pool in our backyard that I have that I try to have open before the school year is house and we spend a lot of time on the deck around the pool just  Chilling and it's it's hard because we are both so goal-oriented people and and we'd like to stay busy. And I think for those of you listening and uddi know you're the same way. You are busy busy body. We need to get busy body. You need to remind yourself that it's okay to not touch work for a little while and that's hard to do but it is so so relaxing and fulfilling when you do so, yeah, there's not any secret for me. It's just it's just letting it stop.  File and taking time for family and just like you said just being just being in the moment and enjoying life as it is right like Nicole so we have to remember like what we what we feel, you know in our classrooms, you know, I know that you're a big proponent of play but in that empty space where there's not a due date or a task that has to be completed in that play in your own classroom. That's when some really creative things can come out of your students, right?  And and I think the same thing is true for us as teachers as we need to have that quiet space if we have everything kind of planned and pushing and I know that I have my best ideas when I'm not sitting down to plan something it's usually I'm driving in the car or I'm somewhere where I'm not even thinking about school stuff. And so I think that I think our minds kind of crave that  Most like white noise activity, you know this kind of just in the background and then that's when we get some clarity I think at times when we're thinking about problems solutions or something like that. We just we need to make sure we're not constantly tasked just like children should be constantly tasked. Right? No, I like that a lot and it's it is I'd like the way you tied that back to my classroom. That was a good thought that it was almost like I know like we plan that but we didn't know we did not plan that but I was I was listening to some  he else the other day and she was talking about you know, the of course, we know the benefits of play right? But but as an adult do we allow ourselves that time to just do nothing, you know, right and I like that a lot because I just had a conversation similar that with teachers at a conference. I was that that that one of my slides and my play session set basically just says just let them play like in and you see so much as a teacher when you step out  Out of that. Yeah. This is how it should be done Rel just watch kids be kids. So that's a great comparison because I know what I just sit down and let myself be myself. I guess without a deadline or write a routine. I unwind it I feel like I'm a much happier person to be around than what I'm thinking about other stuff. Well, and I think sometimes people think that unwinding is watching TV which for some people that's very relaxing, but I think that's a different.  Process when you're watching TV or watching a video if your kids are watching a video watching TV, it's not the same process. It's almost like your brain the sounds like Invasion Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but it's almost like your brain is taken over and filled up with what you're watching. Right? So your braid is just sort of like on pause most of the time if you're really into your show. It's just on pause and I think that there's a value in that sometimes we need that some  It's like sometimes my brains on pause and I'm not watching TV but there's a value of just kind of that brain-dead activity if it's if it's in limitation, but I'm talking about that that other space where it's not jumping from one visual to another it's maybe you're you know going for a walk or you're doing you know gardening activities or you're at the pool like you said or going on a hike those are things that allow your mind to just kind of wander.  Now, I think that having that mind wandering is where you can really just be introspective and it really does allow me to be recharged more when I do that then binge watching Breaking Bad or something, right and I it's it's a hard conversation to have with people who aren't Educators because everyone throws out that stereotype of will you get all the Summers off and you get this month off and you get that mother but it's it's something that needs to be said that there is so much work.  Crammed into those nine months of the school year that we don't get the time off that people do throughout the year. I mean we bring so much work home. I know I did and I know Tricia does all teachers do there's no I can't think of it. I'm not trying to knock another careers, but I can't think of many other careers where you have to bring your work home to get it ready for the next day. Right? Like right now this conversations people. I know a lot who don't don't have to take anything out of the office or because their job can't take in the office and their home is their home and that's their time to  Impress him. Unfortunately for teachers we don't get that too often as much as I try to separate school and home life. We are a school family obviously because we're both Educators. There's a lot that comes home and and whether it's stress or not, it leaves little time to decompress during the school year. So the summer is very very important for teachers. And in that sense. Well, I think for a lot of a lot of teachers are we this is true for me teaching was my job when I was in the classroom full-time. That was my job, but it was also my hobby.  Like I loved it so I could easily do teaching stuff seven days a week. I can be thinking about teaching working on teaching creating programming to teach 7 your shopping. It's shopping for teaching. I have a whole bag of Target stuff. I just picked up so it's it's something that we just I think for a lot of teachers, hopefully, hopefully if you're in the classroom, it's your passion and it's probably part of your hobby and you're always trying to improve your craft. So I  I get that because I can I can get kind of sucked up in that but at some point you have to just allow your brain to to step away for a moment or two, you know, you want to make sure you're paying attention to the other things that are happening your health your family your friends. You know, those those are the things that really matter, of course your students are counting on you so that they matter as well, but you know the your family and your  And your your health really important. So right I think the other the other thing too and we talked about PD quite a bit you and I because we both are part of the professional development world, but although this is an unwinding and separate in school from family is attending events during the summer to whether you're speaking or going because the networking that happens from those not just in the educational but in the friend world, and I know you and I both just got back from a big conference and a couple of conferences both of us actually and just  Surrounding yourself with the people who make you a better person. I think it is huge besides you framing because that sure your school family, right? You know, nobody else gets excited about many erasers like teachers to I mean, nobody does right. It's just a teacher thing. That's true. Oh and six-year-olds. But other than that, that's you know, that's it. Those are fun conversations to have and so you got to find the people that you can have those conversations with talking to a teacher who we were at a conference and she  Had attended on her own so she didn't have she didn't go with the group of people. She's just went on her own and she was talking about I said, what'd you do last night? And she's all we all went out to blah blah blah and I said, oh are you here with the group? She said no, these are just people I met and I thought how cool is that to go to an event and then meet people and kind of have the beginning of a, you know, support system outside of your building because I think sometimes it's nice to have a support system outside of the people that you see  Every day because you can sometimes we the people you see every day in your building fantastic support, but they're all bugged by the same things that you're bugs. You know, like, why do we have to do this bus schedule thing? Why do we have a meeting? You know, those kinds of things those irritants that you know, the scope of Life aren't big but they feel big when they're happening to you. So it's kind of nice to have some peers who maybe have different experiences that you do. I know that really helped me as a teacher having friends virtual friends, basically.  That were you know, elsewhere that exact. Hey, how do you handle that or how does your building handled this so that you can really think about other Solutions but it's good. It's funny. You said that too because there were a couple of teachers I ran into a Nationals that had met each other through the app like reached out because they were there by themselves maybe with the same group of T. I don't know and in one of my sessions the last day or the third day, it was one of those teachers 50th birthday and the other two teachers that were there who had never met each other or her before  It had built this bond that week went around the exhibit hall and bought things for the my gosh that's room and gave them to her as gifts. So like she got a planner from our friends Jose and Sean from Berto and Co and think for like all these gifts of my session and I said, oh my gosh here with your friends and they said no we just met each other but it's your 50th birthday and then here to top it off and this shows how how like-minded teachers are we saw them the next night at dinner and I introduced you to my wife and some friends that were with us and I said these teachers just met and they celebrate.  A birthday and they said yeah and that were planning the backpacking trip through Europe together and I was like No And they were serious to do not like they were looking at flights schedules and these three teachers who just met with the like-minded interests of going to this conference for the same passion are now planning a worldwide vacation together. How nice is that? Yeah, because you know, I mean classroom can be isolating. You know, it can't be isolating your you're in there with you know, your little little short friends, but you know, you don't, you know interacting with people all you know big  All day how nice it sort Fred that was good friends. So I mean how awesome is it that I didn't know. I don't know if they're the same people but they sure sound like they could people but I hadn't heard that that's cause pretty well. Let's go forward with that then. So how do you take this into the school year and besides the the conference tough one big thing and I think you do as well as Trish and I read read read a lot and there are so many great PD books out there. Maybe we can do another episode just on some of our favorite books, but that  That I love that there are so many to list that it could take a whole episode I guess but yeah, I think what you mentioned about that like-minded and the sometimes it can be closed. I don't know what the word you said, but you said turning bad. I know no other word you said about it can feel  The classroom isolated. So how do we you guys you all seriously I have a lot of camera with him so I could see him and he's doing like all these hand motions like they're gonna understand what I've tried to do with my grades. Okay, the first word what's an isolated. It is very isolating. Sometimes that's good. You're with the team that is, you know, maybe brings you down or rains on your parade. Sometimes it's good to have that and sometimes you know, if you're a person who really crave  Herbs that interaction, you know, we have these in reverse and extroverts. Right? Like I'm an introvert like I'm all about shut the door and let me do my thing where other teachers need to have, you know, other adults with them and or not, they don't need to but that's what fuels right right that's what feeds them and gives them energy for me. I get my energy through isolation. So I think it's really important that as you think about how are you going to keep your energy up to the school year once it starts you have to really kind of  I'm and what energizes you what gives you energy? Is it going to book club with friends or is it sitting on the back porch and reading your book on your own? Like those are the things you have to kind of think about like people are always surprised that I say, I'm an introvert but I am like, I wiii give me that Solitude on my arm up at that all day long. I love being with people but it I recharge through Solitude right? I  Think I think the mixture of those two things and why I think why those teachers clicked the way they did that we spoke about that met each other was they all had some obviously at some common teaching but maybe that isolation within their own building stops them from wanting to reach out to others or it maybe it's remember that brings them down. Like you said, hopefully that's not the case for a lot of you but one thing that I have found very successful in obviously it worked out well because my wife and I taught in the same building, but Justin I speak a lot about this when we go out and do talk.  On our family like structure in a classroom is to find what we call your tea BFF your teacher best friend forever and maybe that's not someone on your team and that's okay. So maybe because of the way your team runs or the way, you're building runs, whatever it maybe you do want to isolate yourself and that's okay if that's the way you are but there's so much learning to be had like DeDe and I did not work together. We've never been in the same school, but we may isolate ourselves at times but coming together like this Sparks so many ideas so  So if you don't have that on your team going into the school year or maybe you and your team get along great, but your ideas are just as so different which is which is okay my team that I taught with we got along just fine. We did a lot of things together, but we were all very much different styles and different philosophies, but I found that in Tricia in our building and we linked our classrooms together quite a bit with her second grade classroom in my kindergarten classroom. And now that I'm out of the building she's done that with a junior high teacher and they do a lot together with a junior high.  So I guess to keep this idea going forward of constantly learning from each other and taking, you know, maybe your decompress a little during the summer and you found some some fun ways to learn from other teachers take that with the year and share your knowledge. And that's another key to is you all are full of so much more potential than any of us give our credit yourself credit for yeah, and and your ideas are valuable outside your four walls and whether you want to share them.  Openly or not? Yeah, there may be a teacher there. That's that's seeking out something. You have to give so keep that in mind. Go to the year. I guess. I love that Adam. That's really that's that's that's so true. I feel like some up sometimes you know, when one of the things I love about presenting as I hear so many ideas from teachers who are in the audience and they or I don't know is that the right word audience but people who are there to watch me do what I totally understand why they are like, oh, well, we do it this way I was  Brilliant never even thought of that you know, and so I think I think sometimes people, you know think that their ideas may not be something that you know other people want to hear but oh my goodness so great. Facebook is a really good also for building those relationships. I mean, they could be the devil Facebook could be the devil but is also can be very supportive as well yet. So in your I'll plug your Facebook group for sure because I've learned a lot from  Not just you Indiana and people that are that are big players in that game. But some of the people who pipe into your group and share an idea. I've learned so much from just kill me being a random teacher listening to something or reading something and from a random teacher who just said. Oh, yeah, try this or here's a comment or utilized for a suggestion. You're right. It is a cool place. I'm going back to the conference presenting thing. I tell people that from the start of my sessions. I will learn just as much from all of you as you ever will for me because the ideas that get shared when people come together for a  One reason is huge. Yeah, I agree. I agree. So one of the things that I do try to do though when you get back into school year because I could be really guilty of you know, coming home Friday night kind of unpacking thinking about schoolwork doing a little bit of work and then working all day Saturday and Sunday prepping something from I mean, I could I could go seven days a week and never let up and so a couple things that we have tried works. Well is just a carve-out  Period of time where it's like sacred like nothing's going to get in this window of time. If I'm behind on a due date I mean now is a doing what I do. If I'm behind on a due date this is still sacred time because you know, you can't you can't go at that speed forever something suffers either you suffer those around you suffer or your or your craft suffers, so you got to make sure you have that time. I call like self care which I know is so  New agey, but let me just let me just light an incense and ring a bell real quick wise but I think it is really important. And I think it was a great. I like that image that I just got well, I'll just have to but that was too good not to put on our whatever those robes are called and just you know home, but you know, actually I love I love to meditate. I know that's like really really odd for those people who don't but  Okay, I don't think it's odd. It looks like right now you're so weird said ring a bell. That was the best everybody be quiet quiet, but I know how that I know that feeling like we used to do GoNoodle in the class. We would have that automatic quiet breathe. Yeah omote and it just sort of centers you and it makes you a little less monkey brain. I don't know if you got like monkey brain like you're all over the place, but by daily meditating that does it does help a little bit.  That's good. And I think that also the calm mean factor of that. I'm admit I don't meditate but finding that calming way surely you need to Adam Lee I need to if you looked around my office right now you would see that I need to get something in check. I don't know but yeah finding whatever it is that calms you is huge and I think the hard part about that like you said carving out a specific specific time for yourself or your family or your kids whatever it may be but reversing that and not taking yours.  Stresses of home into your classroom is a big one too. I interviewed a familiar face between United a prisoner named Cheryl Turner who's a phenomenal educator and presenter and she shared a really really cool idea with that. So teachers going back in your classroom and dealing with the stress of home life or family or bills or whatever. It may be just as it is important not to bring those stresses from school. Sometimes home to your own family. It's important not to take your family stresses to your school family because those little Minds don't  Stand what you're going through and and it means nothing to them. Really so her idea was this and I've shared it on my show Once time before I think on YouTube that she said she keeps a Post-It note pad in her console in her car and if something is driving her nuts on the way to school or if she's just got something on her mind or you know, like I said bills have gotten her down or family's got her down or something. Something negative is happened to not take it through the school day. She writes on a Post-It note. She sticks to her - and she remind yourself that that will still be there when she gets  Gets out of school for the day and doesn't let that bother her while she's at school. And I know that may seem easier said than done but I thought that was a cool. I guess I'm meditating for my guess. Yeah and yourself and let me just deal with this later. Let me just put this aside for right now and then I'll it'll be there when I get back, right? Yeah, maybe that's the easy way to find that balance. I don't know balance home and life and keeping separate but it's a challenge. It is a challenge and I certainly haven't mastered it. I don't think I ever will but I'm always striving and hopefully those who are listening.  We'll also have some some ways that they take care of themselves and those besides the little people than there with like that. Yeah, and here's the thing to you that I like that you just said that you're always striving. Is that what's the saying like once you stop learning you stop growing or something like that? Like if you're continuing to learn you're going to continue to grow and you're going to we're always trying to do something better for ourselves. So I think that's the big key is focus on you this year. Not just you as a teacher but you as a person and do what you can.  My big push for that just just go in with a positive mind and remember that it's it's not all that. It's not all that bad. Right? I always tell teachers just try the year school year try to be a better teacher this year than you were last year whatever, you know, whatever skill you felt like you didn't have last year work on it this year and make that, you know keep everything else going right keep everything else going, but, you know, just try to be better.  This year than last year. You don't have to be perfect. Right? You don't have to be perfect because there isn't such a thing but you just have to strive to be, you know better because you know more you've had more experience you had another year of experience you've had another year of learning along the way so, you know more so you should your your your teaching should change your over year and you should feel a little more confident and you know be better teacher this year there when your last year I like that better better. You not better than someone else better than oh,  Past that's a look at it. When you mention the word comparison earlier, I think about that all the time that that we need to stop comparing ourselves so much and and make it make yourself better for you and not for someone else. That's a look at you still now this like, dr. My gosh, but I know just call me. Dr. Phil dr. Dee Dee. I'm going to start baby. No. No, we sure enjoyed this time with you guys. Thank you so much.

Thanks for coming. Welcome to the podcast Monique Simon Tucker and Placida lunga.  Me about your shirt. Is that what Johnny Cash? Yeah, so just a Johnny Cash t-shirt. I got it at a thrift store like somewhere downtown. Was it a black market on Queen Street? I want the black market, but I didn't like that one too. Yeah, like it too much. That's a weird vibe to it as a really weird weird smell as well.  As you go down the smell gets progressively worse like it hits you. So soon as you're down there you're shopping through all the clothes. Like I'll just like you'll go. You know what you'll pick something up and then they'll just wet.  Right back on the rock artist.  I'm just happy I'm on the spotlight for this Pink Floyd. Don't no no, no.  No by her to start out. I think we'd like to do a recap of what happened this weekend starting out first game on Friday women's soccer.  Nothing against Laurie and Laurie a good for a middle of the pack. Will someone on oh you met Wes. Those are there was a hat-trick on that game was there not those are hot trick in that game. Let me you know confirm I do believe somebody got a hat trick. He oniy Johnson named oua athlete of the week by the way huge for her. I mean, she also want athlete of the week for York not surprised. No surprise there then Shoji  I'm not you and I should know this 100% I love to Ye Olde Latoya. Yea So La Toya who's also named a few of the week. Congratulations to him. So no shortage of goals with them to he's also a men's soccer, right? Yeah. Boom. Alright. Yeah and Lori as well on Friday 9 3 soccer game that is so they're holding strong at number one and all you a West nice little stir.  That's the most goals scored in a game and almost a year and the most goals scored by one team in oil a West since 2014 when Western beat a team. He scored two goals set out to Glow boy.  Like careers like what do you what do you do so I know proceed you I just cuz I used to do a triple jump as well. And I know you do triple jump to the so I we got that little bit of a form of a connection there and I love the ability to know that what it takes to be a high-level triple jumper, even though I wasn't at that point, but even when I did it there was people who were high level triple jumpers at that time and I would always talk to somebody would say man. We would train everyday kind of thing. They were too young to be lifting at that.  Time but they would be doing stuff always jumping always, you know, whatever they had to do at the time that was possible every day. They were doing it. So like what kind of training does it take at this level? I'm kind of curious about that at this level are requires a lot of time a lot of strength work a lot of Plyometrics just because like you can't have any weaknesses in the event pretty much like your upper body has to be strong core has to be strong hips glutes. Everything has to be strong.  I'll show in your jumps like your buckle and your breakdown. So for now like in this part of the Season, we're just trying to strengthen our joints. So we're doing a lot of stairs. So it strengthen our ankles our knees as well and we're starting to do like double leg hops just to get the Plyometrics right and get the Rhythm and then we're still strengthening the hips the core so it's a lot of work, but we don't start triple jump technical until closer to November.  Okay, just so that we don't you know jump her body into the ground right course, but yeah, it's pretty good. It's intensive but it's fun like when you jump well and you're happy with your jump. It just feels smooth and you know, you landed the sand and the sky. Okay, these nice new second team All-Star. It's like a team All-Star. How does it take? Because we don't do a hundred meter. No hundred mean. I remember we talked about that at the dinner at the breakfast. We're not  Here's about that. Why is there no hundred-meter a lot of the facilities in North it's they're not big enough. Okay, so they cut it to 60 meters. Oh, yeah. Let me get closer. They cut it to 60 meters. So like like he can how big this facility is like it'd be expensive to make 400 indoor track. So a lot of them are 200 there, right? Yeah. You're right. Okay. So even with your 60-meter same kind of question, what does it take to be a you know an elite I mean you  came second to know you weighs 8 in the night and the nation or sorry 13th in the nation 8th in the nation for for by 800 meter. No, no. No. Yeah, so to be a high-level, you know still Sprinter regardless, what does it take to be high level with that realistically mental capacity. Everything is mental like technically sound like my coach always.  Like he's like everyone thinks they can run 60 meters away. You can't like he's looking for a new design this year. Yeah really involves waking up early.  We do stairs. I have a playlist. I just put my headphones on Apple watch sets. Like if you people have phones it's heavier. So doing it with a wash or whatever. Yeah, that's my kickoff song is finito by Chief. So that just gets you like think of it 7:00 a.m. You're by yourself.  So three straight Chief. Keef songs came up. It was bouncing laughing to the bank and finito and I was just sitting there that's this is part of the reason I was late because I didn't shower and time because this happened so I was just sitting there. I'm just like, oh what am I gonna do today that I need to listen to cheap key because if you listen to Chief Keef at sea  Have been a in the morning these you need motivation at that point. You just need to know what you need. You need a whole container of that pre pre workout. You don't know you take all of it. Caffeine is what I take every like every morning just like shrink pill like I drink it like I take the pill and I'm like, I'm like, oh, yeah. I've actually I've been trying not to get into Kafka. I've actually wanted to try it. So I never drink so much.  I think what we've taught you brought we brought this up when I drink coffee. I put like it was a little milk thing that put like four or five of them and then I put like six seven eight. Nine ten bags of sugar. Yeah.  And a slight bit of a cock. It's 100% a milkshake and I'm like like is that it's not coffee about you know what I'm saying? Is there like an alternative for that? Because an iced coffee because coffee doesn't taste good. Let's rock. It does not taste called if anyone wants to disagree more. It's horrible coffee is horrible either. No, I don't think the gym was that we come here.  I think the worst because obviously people don't wear shoes on that money obviously is very very Lawless. I think it was 2016. I had a summer job done that some scarlet and one time I was taking so I took the bus that will bring me from darkness and Scarlet to Hyde Park Station.  Then Hyde Park Station to Jane station. I got on the 35 by Jane station. It's not making my way home whatever and I get onto the back of the bus and I had my earphones on but I'm hearing like some background noise. So I'm wondering what's going on. I kind of look over and these two ladies are arguing. I'm are cool. Right will see how this ends. So I sit down listen to my music and I'm just waiting to see which one of them will get off first. Oh Fox won. The ladies is here stop now, right so she stands up so I look at both parties.  It's not the other lady. She looked the lady that supposed to stand out. Yeah, she stands and she looks at her, you know her arrival her opponent as she says something whatever it was now the other lady that sitting down, you know has her rebuttal. Okay, you know is he didn't know it before you know it some Blitz on one person right some with those are water bottle the other way and yeah, man, I've countless stories from that bus, right it builds character.  That's all I can say. Just Boys to Men for sure to it Boys to Men. That's the thing. I love about Toronto. I mean because you're you're from Toronto. It's not too bad. It's not too bad. It's not the same but it's not too bad outskirts outskirts. You got it out of Province out of out of City. No, can we draw us your house yesterday?  I'm pretty much on the highway. Well, it's it they don't really have highways at home the way you think of Highways it's likely one. It's like a back road like one row only one line and then Kelsey's from Winnipeg which is where you guys visited earlier this year for your sports. What was your opinion on the city? I'll start because good cop bad cop airport told me about the  airport are peine de novo cow talk about the airport. So I don't tend to leave the city right unless it's for like track and field or family purposes. So most of my life I just spent in Toronto. So getting on the flight was pretty awesome. Like that was the second flight. I've got in on my life, right? So Toronto to Winnipeg so I had no clue what's going on. Yeah spending a week over there was pretty cool for me. Like, you know a nice little Escape right? It's always good to  You know, it's get away from the gym every now and again, it was cold, but it was quiet so pretty cool. So I enjoyed it. Yeah and yourself Maya my opinion was kind of dead in a hotel like that was not in the downtown core. So every other team was in the downtown core we were in like outskirts like it was basically Countryside of like if we go in anywhere in Ontario  Are you were what was the called the canid in you said?  Because we're not eating. You're right. You're right. Hooray. So we saw it like the forks and stuff, you know what that is, and then when we get back from that practice  Session then we would have a lunch later on. Now. You have a bit more time where you can either study your hang out with some friends and then you would have to have your dinner. And now once you've had your dinner, you don't want really want to leave the hotel because it's cold. You don't know where you at.  Hold it was Pitch Black. You guys get dark really quickly, you know we did time. Yeah winter. Yeah, so it's pitch-black and it's like seven eight o'clock and I'm like shit you watch out.  When they got back to the hotel story, I was just so happy I wasn't there because the way I would have reacted, you know, people say our place is not real. He's a snake he wasn't there for us.  Let's get out of here. The guy tries to put his hands on Quinn first and I was like nah, I was that we were pushing back. So you are one of the car.  Across the street traffic has to stop. Yeah, the guys behind us like everything is well, please please keep pushing their track and field athletes as well. You can run away from no no Mike.  Really? Sorry I missed airport. Mr. Airport. Yeah, I love this story. Mr. International. I had only gone on one flight my whole life and that was when I was first immigrating to the  Country, right and that was like 2003 and it was 20. Was it 20? 1929 National? Yeah, it was this year. So now it's March 2019. So that's what 16 years. I'm gonna cool, you know airport. So our tickets are booked and everything people are telling me aa download the was it WestJet?  Is already there can't you assume that I will be on my way. What am I signing in? So now I check in as I say, I walked into the airport and this is where like I had a misunderstanding. I thought that I would walk into the air point and then there's like the plane is just right there. Right? So I walk in and it looks like any of the instructions you posted in the yeah, it looks like a mole and I'm seeing like a bunch of kiosks and people are just walking towards.  Some like how do you know where to go and how people are typing in whatever information I see them print out the slip putting it on their luggage. Can I put this into context? Okay. Do you know when you go into the airport and you can do self check-in? Yeah, so we were doing that to get a look at what do I have to check in? Like you're going to see me on the play? You'll see that my  I see is filled and I'm there to distinguish my luggage. I put like No-Frills bag rapper. Like I tied it on there, right? So everyone knew that was mine. No bag tags.  The most was Jane thing. I have like people were laughing at me and I just want to distinguish my bag. I don't lose my items, right? What's funny?  You should do before you're late. Did you read it? Look I skip through it. All right, so whatever. So now we have two so there's a bunch of steps. So they scan your bags. They put a sticker on your bag and then they scan you and then they say it is open up your backpack again Oh, you mean like when you go to that?  About check is going and my process was not smooth. I'm like it. Why is everyone getting their luggage in my is not here? Cool. I open up my luggage you take out my lotion, right? So yeah, I need that. All right, and now apparently I could have lotion in there some reason. I don't know right he had the big one.  When I got there, there's like two guys that are working there and they're from like Derek. I think they're from Ghana one was a Kwame next was like cool and just like off the Jump we are busting jokes, right whatever and it was like, you know good times and how I met your brother. I can't get my lotion back. It's gone, you know how it goes, but I bought it yesterday, right? So now it's like, you know good atmosphere and now I think their supervisor maybe she sees that were you know, we're Bustin jokes. Yeah, she wants to get  Wolves, but it's like I don't know you like that and before you know it like she just told what she called me. She like now, you won't get your lotion actually boy and that's not to say I kind of switch. I was like wait, you know, it's not one of those we love yeah, that was a bit annoying. I don't like when people kind of like, you know, never mind, you know, I've been called a sheep.  So we're all trying to save the Earth and stuff. Right? But when I reuse my No-Frills bag or I use a milk bag to hold my shoes. I'm the bad guy, right but  Yeah, you had those. Yeah, I use that is the bags of milk milk. I mean, I'm so sorry. It's silk 25% off. I'm not even kidding you.  Gross it is. Would you be able to tell the difference? Yes, if I put them in you honey? 100 100 100 ever since I tried it the bag milk. Once I promise you I almost threw up. She begged bulk isn't a thing in Manitoba. Like we don't know like that's that it's like when I came to Ontario and like my roommate Chelsea Tucker at the time. She's like, oh, yeah, we drink milk like okay for sure and then  Forget it Leah my roommate now she we liked it the procedure cut the top off the glass and I puked in the sink because it was so nasty. I know how you guys do it in a carton put the lid tighten it back on. So it's nice and sealed so that when you throw up, yeah, the big milk world's gross. It's gross never again never again.  Is before on against Andrew do you want to finish up our recap of what happened this weekend? Yeah, we didn't finish that you've missed games. No. No, we only at soccer. Unfortunately I had to work so I wasn't able.  12 loss but that was only in like the fourth quarter is really close and oh right you have to but that's kind of what makes I don't know about so it makes McMaster the number two team in the province right now though. They're like ability just like overcome stuff like that, but got to give a shout out to Jackson Hume for that huge hundred and seven kick return touchdown. Hello record of some sort.  He showed some serious speed on that return, but I would also like to shout out my boy Jordan burger. Right? What's a high school together? You know, it hasn't been the easiest patch for him. But he's shining now and he's keeping the you know, the benefits of his hard work. So shout out to him and enjoy the be touchdowns on the day. He's on the opposing team. He's still my boy, right?  At their my guy I believe in I believe in so the other day I saw a picture on Instagram. It was I can't remember their names but it was three quarterbacks. It was Tom Brady and then I think it was last year his two backups. And now all three of them are all what Tom Brady's through know one of them's on the Colts. He's 300 Garoppolo and Brissette. Yes, those two those two.  Guy, so I mean literally shalt know crazy. Keep doing your thing. Keep doing your thing. Your time will come that's for sure for sure. And yeah, next up was a field hockey their three games this weekend. Their first one was a three nothing win versus Western. Would you like to showed already knew who was right now? I don't know anyone on the western team a shout-out to the York women's field hockey team another one.  Numbers Waterloo on Sunday and then they are lost 3-1 versus U of T as well, which is actually there's another stat their first or you a loss in 25 games. Yeah, they are. They're a team like I think of all the teams at York one field hockey doesn't get as much credit because people don't know too much about field hockey and second of all people. I feel our  more detached from that team. I don't know why they're one of the coolest groups of people I've ever met. They all have to shoot the same way. You know that you have to shoot right? Yeah. Yeah, right.  No, yeah, you can use the back. You're sick. It's like an automatic penalty goes to the other team or something. Yeah, like yeah, there's still they are skilled at all.  Forget CarMax, honestly forget CarMax.  Okay, but yeah, I guess moving on to the they were arguing about fascinating in case because you can't see what's going on. See you tomorrow little bit.  This is my personal one Leslie. I understand that all right, and just to wrap up our little recap of the week. Shout out to Men's Basketball huge hundred tons of 45 win against UTM. Yeah, not much to say about that as a slop. They play their plane in Nova Scotia that place st. Mary's. I think it's tonight or tomorrow one of the days but that's sick. That's nice. That is sweet. That's nice. And while we're on that I guess women's hockey on and I sold three game. We're on.  At the moment so - beating Western. Well last night in Clinton was a fun game. That's fun game. It was like the signing autographs and stuff, you know for a little one son signed a couple autographs.  Lots of people there and it was like for Courtney Becky was there from Goderich. So, you know, which is near Clinton for people who are unfamiliar with the geography of small town Southwestern Ontario. Where is that person so getting back into our conversation with you guys you both had  A lot of involvement with the school a lot of different jobs and stuff that you've gone through. What have you liked the best in your jobs working here? That's part of the jobs. I think having like just meeting every let me go closer. Which one was your favorite that's really hard like right now, I work at the underground. So like having food as a perk is really good. Like my I'm addicted to sweet potato fries.  So yeah, I think pause is one of my best jobs here like working with first-year athletes like seeing their transition like it's so cute. Like oh my gosh. I've been working there since like second year. So like I was a mentor and training then working as a mentor like the transitions like, oh my gosh, like you're my mentees.  Mentors. Yeah, that's huge. That's for sure. So it's going to say up with pause is even feel like a job at this point. You know what I'm saying? Like helping I don't want to say the youth but I kind of like the youth to us, you know what I'm saying? The children the children things so like helping them transition. Like how does he feel like a job at this point? You know what I'm saying?  I'll for me. I don't find it that I want to say difficult. No, I don't find it difficult. Like I wouldn't consider it a job in that sense because like the more you do it the more you understand how to do it. So for me the journey the puzzles bit different because I wasn't necessarily a good student in my first year or second year, right? So it took me a while to figure out how to do well academically while balancing track and so pretty much like from the way I learned.  My journey to becoming like a decent student athlete. I was just able to share that information with my with my mentees. So now instead of having a reactive approach in the sense of not having a sense of urgency from the early parts of the semester. I try to get them organized and have them understand that developed the good habits now and you'll be happy Come midterms. And then from there we just built onward and upward so it becomes easier the more you do it.  It but it's it helps as well to actually care about it and I'm sure really want to see other people do well for sure because I know what it's like to be on the other side of that. So yeah, it doesn't necessarily feel like a job and it's rewarding. Yeah, so did you something else about that money? I think we should also explain what pauses yeah.  Out of college students. So it's a mentor program that works with the upper years the lower years. Yeah, it stands for providing athletes with winning strategy speaking of pause. We had a good story about that blasted you want to tell us about the mystery man. Yeah. So first I'm just going to give people like just some background info. So me honestly, like I just like to mind my business, right but the stuff that happened in my life.  Like like and I tell my friends daily and it's like some stuff is just unbelievable. There's times. I tell stories and people don't believe me but you know the normally there's someone there to see this witness, right and I'm thankful for having Witnesses because it's like, you know makes the ridiculous stuff, you know, Leo course. Yeah. Yeah. So we're that pause and I didn't have a mentor group in the morning or mentee group. So I'll stationed in the bookstore. So one we're all in the stands. I see like one gentleman  Like a purple t-shirt and he's kind of like just in the back of the stands. I mean like who's this guy? And whenever I go off to my station and now we finished that we go back to the stadium for a bit. We do yoga. I still see him in the stands cool go to the lecture hall. We do our activities and I still see him in the stands absolutely is this guy and you can kind of see them walking around talking to a few people.  And now fast forward where you're having like our carnival games, so I think I was I was like shooting basketball Kenny we're doing basketball for a bit. And then I was talking to some of the track rookies because we don't meet them until either pause or when we actually start training in the first week of September. So I'm just having a conversation with them and I see the same guy in the purple t-shirt. He's just like, you know, maybe 10 feet away and he's looking straight at me and I'm like, well, this is a bit uncomfortable. Like, who's this guy? I don't know from nowhere right? Cool. So I look at him and I  This gesture like Elsa this guy walks towards me and he's standing like really close to me. Like it's uncomfortably close and he looked me dead in my eyes and you just tells me I need a mentor right? I was just super confused. I'm like, what do you mean like in the inventor? Are you on the paws program? No, I'm okay. Are you a York student? No. No. Oh cool. Have you applied to York? And  Guy told me not having applied to York, but I'm thinking of applying to Humber and I was so confused. I'm like, why is he here? And now it's like the tone kind of changes it goes from this guy just wants to be involved involved and I'm like, okay, so this for first year, you know student athletes, but you're neither a student or a  I don't know what to tell you. He's like, and then he told me no he is mad sketchy because he looks at me. He's like nah, man, I see what this was going on. Like I need a mentor. I know you can help me just help me out and I'm like what type of and I was confused. Now, you're thinking like does this guy want is it gonna want drugs to like set him up with like, you know, what type of mentorship I'm talking about. I don't  I talked to them they sent me here.  And then this guy says me to you. I know you sent me the other side of Campus. I'm not dumb and I'm gonna are not like I'm getting him angry. Like is it gonna swing right? Cuz I'm here. I hope this doesn't escalate here. Right and I look at him. I'm acting like you're I don't know man. I'm sorry. I can't help you and then he leaves for a bit whatever. He goes into the stands. He grabs himself up mentee t-shirt and he puts it on and now he comes back downstairs and I really kill this guy.  Like he just doesn't take no for an answer. Um, I think Michael spoke to him for a bit and then Jack göransson Shadow to Jack on the men's hockey team went to go talk to him as well. And I think the guy just really wanted to help so he helped like the setup part or tear down. I mean he put away like some equipment. Well, are you sure? Yeah. I got some food. Yeah got to play the fool are some ways rice and chicken, you know, shout out to him. Well, yeah, it was a funny situation. It wasn't funny from the other side of the story, but don't worry.  No one was there for me when it was sticky, but I'm here. I'm alive and well, right.  Continuing on the theme of our school jobs and stuff. Plus there's also a photographer. That's how we know each other. We have had a lot of just like sitting there watching soccer games taking pictures and videos of a little bit of milk. There's been a lot of times. I've been to Mike and Mike don't post those videos anywhere because in the background you can hear something.  Honestly guys if that footage leaks like everything that like not necessarily in trouble, but you know, you guys might not look at us the same like we don't say anything crazy, but you know just conversation. Well funny times good time. I really enjoyed that photography just like the worst to take pictures of I find.  Rugby is hard to take pictures of mainly because it's played at night. So a lot of sunlight makes your pictures easy to take you need that for your camera. So yeah in well-lit in their games held so rugby is tricky and also because the flow of the game changes a lot so soccer basketball any other sport you kind of know what's going to happen, but Rugby's like there's a lot of change of possession.  And also find volleyball heart just the net because sometimes the camera focuses on the net as opposed to the player. That's true. But there's some pictures where you'll see us in our numbers, but then it will be clear as day 1440p 100 see everything about the night. You can see the little wrinkles when it comes off all of it. What do you like taking pictures of who do I like taking pictures up? So my favorite sport is soccer.  Yeah played soccer growing up and I wish I was good enough to play soccer at a high level but you know, I wasn't fast so it's like I like soccer a lot. So I think for me that makes it easier to shoot just because I'm interested being there at the game anyways, and I have like a better understanding of the sport Kenny. Who's your favorite team has light US Women's Hockey and you already  You're welcome with women's hockey or just hockey in general, isn't it? I don't see difficult but like knowing who's who at? Okay. Well, there's an eight on the back of your jersey. So you know who's who but like what the masks on because I think the one thing was photography and Sports Photography, especially you want to see facial expressions because that's I mean the ugly ones the you know, the Hard Knocks ones with hockey.  Yeah full on hockey football fencing. You don't know what they're feeling. You don't know how they're looking. You know, I think you can sometimes and I think but I think it's it's difficult because sometimes it messes with like the focus. Yeah. It's like focuses on a mask and says your eyes are a little bit like blurry, but I think for the most part like it's so much.  Body language and what people are doing and things like that. This is so it's such a  huge huge emotions and in everything that happens. I'd like some some of these celebrating like you can tell that they're celebrating even if you can't see like their eyes all shout out to wash she scored yesterday with like a minute left in the game. That's Ellie I've ever seen in my entire life. He turned around to shoot the arrow.  Getting trucked and like their whole body being in midair while they're being trucked like I think that's the one picture. I want to see shout out to happen. I think it was Torey Krug and Robert Thomas and uh, the Stanley Cup finals last year. There's a picture of toward crew got his helmet knocked off and he just like runs over Robert Thomas. It's one of the best pictures. I've seen a lot of times. It's hair just blowing behind them like in midair running over this guy.  I'm just not pull something that long that's cool, but we'll talk about that. Later.  To find me yo run I think honestly and it's not, you know, no shade. No nothing but football right football struggles with the photo credits. So that's you know, that's a bit of that's a pet peeve of mine. And for the most part now like when I first started people didn't really know who I was so it was harder for them to give me photo credits. Although I tell them to give me photographs whatever right, but, you know, some people get used to the system.  Right. So the tag you or they put the little camera Emoji classic feel to your you know, now more underscore pass it on disk or field Z. So that's my photography account. And that's the account that people should be tagging now as opposed to my people blasted jpg underscore jpg.  Guys, please let's make an effort to you know, tag me because you know, we're all trying to grow are all trying to act. So the more profile visits you have the better, you know saying I've got to eat. Yeah, man, you guys have, you know thousand followers here, even if 200 people click my account. That's a difference. That could be a booking not one that takes one man. It takes one was trying to buy some designer shoes guys, please, you know take me so I get my  all visits and I can get bookings. You're excited to see now. I'm excited to see how you guys drip.  You know what I'm talking about. So yeah the pregame because Kelsey's got knocked out. We're going to get it knocked out see why we're going to get knocked but when tracks I know there's so many of you guys and there's so many drippy people on track. So I want to see how the I'm excited to see how that is, especially you being a photographer and you take pictures of that. I want to see when you're on the other side of the camera how it's going to look so for your first moment of drip. What are we going to expect? What do you expect from you guys?  Are things all we always wear headbands? That's our thing. Like you got that little ninja what ya got that ninja with the Nike headband or oh no. No, that's nice me. I like to make sure I stand out in a subtle way, right so pretty much.  UPS you want to wear red t-shirt or red top black pants by make? Sure the Red Top I'm wearing is a different result to one most people have rights and exclusive right the pants. Yeah, we're all wearing black pants white your black pants are like minded right and I like to wear it clean shoes clothes. I tend to have like a competition warm-up shoe. Right that is different for my practice shoot because I don't know how you can go to meet with, you know beat down.  Is I wear arm sleeve. So a red adidas arm sleeve on my left arm as far a white no-name brand had sighs, right? It's super swaggy. No glasses. I have my contacts in nice and then I wear my Breezy shorts. So if you guys watch track in the 1960s and 70s 80s 90s joints were all PS. Yeah.  Is because no one on the guys side wanted to wear them and I'm like you guys don't want that. That's crazy. Right? So the second we got those I was on it and it kind of it really grew on me and people started to see like whoa, like your place is rocking it and we work hard so, you know show off the legs down. You can see the definition. It's pretty cool man. I like that. I really like that.  I really like that. I'll ask you guys less than what are you guys most looking forward to coming this upcoming season, so I know I'm not I'm not sure so I'm staying FaceTime call.  You sport having that little chip on your shoulder and wanting to you know, go back because I think that's the biggest thing once you've gotten a taste. You don't want anything else. So I'm me give you the floor. I think for sorry. I think I mean this Mike thing for me that  You Sports was kind of like a downfall for me because I tripped out of the blocks completely. So that's that's why I came 13th. Like I was not set up to come 13th. So it's like oh like I set myself here. Like I was supposed to be up there and I was just like I was really like, I'm not the person that gets mad and starts throwing stuff or whatever like my teammates saw what happened and they literally all started like clapping from the but I was like I was like, oh my God  Like I love my teammates, they're amazing. They literally got me through. It. Looks like nothing shit. Like look at me Tom. Yeah because like you just don't realize that like, there's eight Lanes. Yeah, and it's like everyone is watching. Yeah. That's one it on like like I realized that pressure most in the Olympics 100. Yeah. They stopped all events. Everything's quiet for that.  At like that's what my event is. Yeah, like everyone just like types of but I was like, there's so many others.  I think it's so easy to cheer for it because you don't have to wait for the officials to come out and measure your distance and stuff like that. It's like ends and you saw who won and you can like cheer for that instantly. Like it's just that instant gratification. Yeah all for me. I'm really looking forward to see what to seeing what we can achieve as a team this year. We made some really solid additions on the men's side on the women's side as well. So we have a lot more athletes that can score some serious points for us and it makes the come  Petition inter-squad competition interesting especially in the field of events in the long jump. We're deep triple jumper deep and I'm learning to high jump now. So that's another thing. I'm looking forward to doing. So yeah, I'm looking forward to us, you know, just yeah shout out to Berkeley. I'm looking forward to really having our team perform better and score better because all you ate two years ago on the men's side. We came forth by one point and how I blame myself for that.  Because in long jump I didn't perform as well as I should have I think I finished eighth as opposed to like at least 6th or 5th. Right? So those extra points could have, you know been the difference. Wow. Wow didn't accomplish what we wanted to do as a team last year and seeing as this is my last year. I really want to make sure that I can write my wrong. I'm sure you know two years ago and hopefully, you know, the home field advantage home court advantage we can execute.  And you know come to other three. So yeah your client's Nation. If you're listening to this, please come out and support us makes a difference. So what that does kind of one last question just kind of give us a little update with your season. How's that going to look the the meet you guys have? What are you guys looking at? The meats? We have lined up we start with our red and white meat, which is our first home opening meet. That one is the one where we kind of finalize the team that the people are able to  Sorry, sorry, it's okay. It's okay. The we have a lot of Walk-Ons and try out. So that is their chance to try out and make the team. Yes, after that. We kind of go on like Christmas break where that's our hard train because he's like, oh you don't have classes exam period we're gonna have long hard practices. Are you guys like those practices? Were you just crying? Yeah, you're literally have to go again. Really right now. I can't  I'm um like January is one like every weekend. We have a me. Like wow, that's a back like some are we have first went to U of T. Then we go to Michigan and we all like we go to the US for a lot of meat because we don't have that many facilities. We don't a lot of traffic we have us you have t in Windsor. Yeah, you've teased facility is quite small cousin is they have an outdoor track as well. Do they?  Yeah, but  I'm really looking forward to we have our Guelph tanky classic. It's not Army. It's the wolf meat. So that's think normally the second week of November. So the first time we can really open up so I'm looking forward to that one because that may be the first time I high jump, you know of training goes if training is going well. I'm jumping wall and training now. I'd like to break that duck there. So I'm looking forward to that and then just honestly any Stateside me. I just like going to the state level log, right so, Michigan  In Ohio, wherever we're going I'm happy real quick before we wrap off Ohio. Would that be Spire Institute? Would you be going to Spire?

Welcome to today and True Crime app are cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're covering the final hours of Johann ho who was sentenced to death after marrying and subsequently murdering countless women. Let's go back to the morning of February 23rd.  shortly before noon in a County Jail in Chicago  Johan was Restless he'd laid awake all the night before even a Hearty dinner hadn't been able to lull him to sleep after all. He was scheduled to be executed today and didn't want to waste his final hours of Life on Slumber. Of course. He hadn't fully let go of the hope that maybe these wouldn't be his last hours after all since he'd been found guilty of his late wife's homicide, Johan and  Lawyers had worked tirelessly to overturn his conviction. He had persuaded an endless stream of journalists visitors and female fans that he was innocent. Hopefully the judge was similarly susceptible to his charms. The only way to know for sure was to wait the hangman was supposed to arrive sometime between 10 a.m. And 2 p.m. Now that noon approached. He could only hope that the window would  Pass, and he wouldn't be summoned.  The sound of footsteps approaching his cell dashed his hopes soon enough the deputy sheriff and a Jailer arrived to read him his death warrant. It was too late or perhaps too early. Johan announced. I want all that is coming to me in the way of time. If you try to take me before 1:30, I will fight.  His argument seemed to work neither the Jailer nor the deputy sheriff insisted that Johan face execution a minute before 1:30 p.m. Once again, he'd said just the right thing to get what he wanted the minutes ticked by Johann sat on his bench pretending to make the most of the final hour and a half. He bought himself. He kept his face and inscrutable mask.  Never let anyone else see his fear. Johan intended to Die the same way. He'd lived in complete control over the people around him. But all too soon the Fateful hour arrived at 1:30 Johan Rose from his seat resigned to the fact that he couldn't fight his Destiny any longer but to his surprise now it was the guards turn to delay the inevitable.  And he refused to a skort. Johan to The Gallows they'd been friendly during his internment. Now the keeper couldn't bear to see him to his death. So Johan earned another few seconds of clemency while another guard was found to a skort him on the last walk he'd ever take  Finally at 1:30 2:00 p.m. Johan reached the scaffold and took in the sight of the Noose that would end his life. He stepped up onto the platform and realized he needed to make his last few seconds count. He said father forgive them. They know not what they do. I must die an innocent man. Goodbye. He waited to hear if anyone would respond.  Argue with him or even recognize he was quoting Jesus Christ. No one did instead. The last thing Johann ever heard was the trapdoor opening beneath him.

He'd been convicted of murdering his wife and was suspected to have killed dozens more women, but even after johanns violent manipulative past was revealed. He continued to charm everyone around him. Johan didn't come across like an expert.  If you later, he was overweight underpaid and in poor health, but he probably learned the value of Charisma soon after he immigrated to the United States around the mid-1890s at the time. He went by the name John Schmidt and was likely in his early 30s. He began courting Carolina Striker a Dowdy middle-aged single woman. He married her soon after they met helped himself to her money.  And disappeared Without a Trace 11 Days Later by most accounts. Karolina was one of the lucky ones Johann habitually courted women took their money and then skipped town and occasionally, he'd tie up Loose Ends by fatally poisoning his latest spouse with arsenic.  This was a modus operandi. Johan would use dozens of times over the next several years. He adopted various aliases Jacob Huff Martin Doats and his most famous named Johan. Ho the shifting names helped him stay one step ahead of the police. He was an expert at escaping Justice and at wheedling his way into vulnerable women's lives. He regularly wedded ladies.  Were middle-aged and not conventionally attractive. They were generally viewed as less valuable by mainstream Society. So they were particularly susceptible to his flattery Johann ho was essentially an early 20th century pickup artist his behavior finally caught up with him in 1905 in December of 1904. He married candy store owner Marie Volker after murdering her.  He quickly seduced and wedded her grieving sister Widow Amelie Fisher, but Days Later a friend of amélie's tipped her off that Johan was a con artist only after she'd given him most of her life savings when confronted with the accusations. Johan fled Amelie put two and two together connected her sister's death to his theft and notified authorities.  By the time the police were involved Johan had already moved on to his next Mark. He was living in a boarding house in New York and had recently proposed marriage to its proprietress Katarina Kimberly. She declined and complain to the police that his intensity frightened her her tip helped the Chicago investigators find their man.  After johanns arrest the police uncovered dozens of past marriages that had all ended in one of two ways with Johan disappearing or with his wives dying of symptoms that perfectly matched arsenic poisoning. He was a bigamist and a serial killer on May 19 1905. He was sentenced to death by hanging strangely. Yo,  Runs conviction did little to hamper his skill at manipulating others from behind bars. He frequently protested his innocence inspiring sympathetic newspaper coverage a group of Psychics reportedly claimed that the ghost of his dead wives had exonerated him. He Charmed his guards who apparently bent the rules to provide him fine meals and regular walks outside. The prison grounds during those walks here a  you'll early flirted with local ladies. He received dozens of love letters and even marriage proposals in the mail and his most recent wife Amelie Fisher Hulk visited him in prison every day to apologize for her role in his arrest these attentions continued right up to the date of his execution, February 23rd. 1906. Johann went to The Gallows.  Being his innocence. Although his charm couldn't save his life Johan demonstrated. Just how valuable Charisma can be in the short term. It can even help you get away with murder.  Thanks for listening to today and True Crime. I'm Vanessa Richardson to hear more stories about Charisma gone wrong.

Episode 8 shame won't make you a better wife.  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dreams. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self awareness along the way.  Hey, you guys. I am so excited to talk to you about this topic today because I think this is one that there's a lot of confusion and I'm really hoping that this episode will help to empower you and give you room to grow and kind of give yourself permission to get off your back a little bit when I was a newlywed one of the things that I remember is a lot of feeling.  I would say shame or beating myself up sort of coming at it from a very like perfectionist place. Right? Like I want to be a good wife and I had this image in my head of what a good wife is and I certainly had an image of what a good wife was not right. She never snapped her husband. She never complained. She was always smiling. I don't know whatever happened man of you know, this is the behavior that I kind of expected of myself. What would happen is I'd have a hard day or something would happen or we have a misunderstanding or he would just do something that  You know straight up annoyed me and I would behave as humans do and a negative way. Then I would come down so hard on myself and I really think it was almost like this drill sergeant in me of like if I can just beat that behavior out of me, then I'll get in line and I'll behave the way I expect of myself. Now. Let me be very clear. This is not what my husband was communicating he expected of me right? I'm not saying that and it's definitely not what was going on.  What was going on is that I have a little bit of a perfectionist streak which many of us do and I had in mind like how I felt I should be behaving that was helped by looking around and seeing lots of couples who've been married a whole lot longer than us and how they never seem to do any of the things that I was still doing and I'm definitely had a hard time transitioning to being married. It came out looking back at it. I don't think any of it was really as bad as I felt like it was at the time.  It wasn't even the behavior but it was kind of my reaction to my own behavior. That was so exhausting and caused so much anxiety and so much drama for me trying to again like kind of drill sergeant muscle my way into behaving in the way that I expected of myself. So I want to just offer you a couple thoughts. If you're resonating with any of this, right if you're ever beating yourself up for the way they were acting or if you ever just coming down hard on yourself.  I want to offer to you. What if it's just normal that sometimes you get to be human. Right? What if it's totally fine that in the context of your marriage you guys can handle sometimes one of you not behaving perfectly and sometimes he could just say something that's just mean and you'd be like okay with that because you get it because sometimes you're human too and like you get it for yourself so you can get it for him. Do you see how sometimes when?  The people who are the biggest perfectionist on themselves can become sometimes the most judgmental like I see that for myself the more that I'm pushing myself the more negative. I become towards the people around me because I kind of feel like well if I'm suffering like let's all suffer with this perfectionism, right? But when you cut yourself some slack, it's amazing how much you can just totally get where other people are coming from be totally fine with them being human and making mistakes and saying stuff. Sometimes they shouldn't say or just having like I call them temper tantrums, you know, like sometimes I'll just be like, I just want to go have a tie.  For tangent. I'm just done right now. Right? So what if that's fine. What if that's totally okay, like there was no part in my brain that considered that that might be okay because I was so caught up in what I was trying to be and how I was trying to show up then it actually was totally an authentic. So instead of me just being who I was and I don't mean like no self-control no morals. No, you know, I could just treat my husband. How are you want? Not at all. But what I mean, is that what happens is we kind of think that we can  Shame ourselves, or we can push ourselves into becoming a better wife or a better husband and I want to suggest to you that that's really wrong. It's just wrong doesn't work. It's ineffective. So there's so many experts out there and coaches and Instagram accounts that are full. I don't know if you follow any of these marriage Instagram accounts, but sometimes I would want to claw my eyes, you know, they're full of these lines that I just imagine like some angry school teacher like waving a ruler at you like saying that right like good husbands always do this good husband's never do this.  A sphere a good wife or you should never do this. You should always do that. So if you want to have a happy marriage you have to do this, right and she needs this five times every day and Hugh have to say this to her and all this stuff and like okay for you know, I honestly honestly and I'm not saying this ironically I really do mean is if this is working for you and if you're getting good ideas, and this is motivating you awesome awesome. But if this is filling your head with all the things that you have to be doing like a good marriage has to have XYZ I want you.  Really question any of that before you accept it as truth and the bigger the expert the more you're going to have to be careful to really filter it through your own wisdom. And when I say filter with your own wisdom, this is what I mean. I'm very interested in the results of our thoughts. I'm a lot less interested in which thoughts are true.  So here's an example if you're feeling resentful of your husband because you're having a thought about him. What's going to end up happening is you're going to communicate less with him. So let's say you have the thought a healthy marriage has good communication and you have in your mind what you consider good communication and you don't consider your husband a good communicator. So you feel resent resentful and anxious. Okay. So what's going to end up happening is you're actually going to start to communicate less with him because we don't like  To talk to people who bring up feelings of resentment and anxiety. Yeah, you following me on this. So the thought that I have sounds very great. Right good marriages have good communication. I went to a good communication. Look at me being all growth-oriented, but what could actually happen? And again, this is different for everyone. This is why everyone has to run these models for themselves. What could end up happening is that now I start to interpret that against my own marriage and my own definition of good communication.  And side note if you haven't listened to the podcast episode your husband doesn't need to tell you how he feels that will totally change your perspective on what good communication might be considered. But anyway, so let's say you don't consider your marriage to have good communication. And so now you're feeling resentful and anxious and so you now you're communicating less. So actually what is the result the result is that you're not in an open and communicative relationship with your spouse the thought that you were having that a good marriage needs good communication actually created.  Opposite result for you. Okay. And so you're now you're like, oh, I'm in a bad marriage with bad communication. Right? So you always kind of prove it it true in an interesting way. Sometimes clinging onto these very holy sounding like a dogmatic sounding lines can actually really hurt us and the same thing with trying to sort of Shame yourself into being a better wife. I want to play this out. So let's say you do something you snap at your husband and you storm out of the room and then you're like, oh my gosh, what did I just do that's  Like a grown-up wouldn't behave that way right? How are you feeling? You're feeling shame and guilt and like embarrassed about yourself. So what kind of action is that going to lead to?  Well, you're probably not going to really act like much of an adult right now, right you feeling shameful guilty and embarrassed.  The result this is not going to bring you closer together to your husband. So what we want to do is we want to look for a result that we want. Okay, so you snap at your husband? What do I want in this moment? What I want is for this not to hurt my marriage. What I want is for this not to break our communication or break our connection. I want to stay connected to him even when I make a mistake. So what if I have a thought normal people snap sometimes  So how is that going to make me feel?  I might feel relieved I might feel sort of okay just why than accepting and so then what am I going to do? I'm going to communicate to him from a place of like, oh, I'm totally human. Sometimes I think of it as like meta feelings. Like I see sometimes the most successful couples, they'll like explain what they sort of want to do like instead of having the tangent know like I really want to have a tangent right now. They're kind of like observing their feelings from the outside and sharing them with with each other which I think is like the most beautiful thing. I would create a podcast  Episode about it, but I don't know if I'm able to get to be to be continued one day but you know if I'm coming from a place of feeling accepting of myself and why so the result that I'm going to end up with is I'm going to keep that communication because the action that I took of snapping at my husband and I had a thought that like, okay normal people snap sometimes so this didn't threaten the relationship anymore right where if I have a thought that like snapping at your husband is bad for your relationship.  Ship so now all of a sudden the thing that I just did which was totally neutral now all of a sudden it's like got all of this baggage of being bad for my relationship and that's actually going to make me spin out into a place that's more negative. Right and that's more dangerous and more harmful to my relationship where if I can kind of accept what happened and I can accept myself with all my emotions and all my behaviors. And again, this doesn't mean I'm not going to try and grow this is the really fascinating thing right because again as a perfectionist, I really  Always thought that growth came from really hard work and mastering self-discipline and I was wrong about that. And what I discovered was that growth comes from understanding yourself better growth comes from opening up the brain and peeking inside and saying what is going on in there that's making me act like that and having some curiosity and some compassion for yourself and just being aware and noticing that's where the growth comes from.  Um because you don't have to bite your tongue if your thought never got you that upset in the first place and so many Studies have come out about self discipline and self-control and how you have like a limited amount in the day and that's why people always binge eat at night right because all day long they've been getting themselves to eat healthy and they just ran out of steam now, I wonder if that's even just a negative thought by itself. Either way. It seems to be the case of my house. I really want you to just question any of these dogmas that you  I have about what a good marriage looks like and what I don't want you to do is question. How true they are. Okay, that's where my clients get hung up. They want to know which ones more true and guess which one feels more true. Usually what feels more true is the one that gives you that really visceral hard gut reaction and it's usually a negative reaction. So guess what? It's usually the negative thought that just feels more true. I don't care which one's more true. You have to believe it. But when you're looking at your thoughts what you want to  look at is not whether this is true or not because usually it's in it's just your interpretation. It's just a thought that you're having what I want you to look at is how is this making me feel and behave and what results am I getting because of this thought and if you want something to be different in your life, you need to look at what the results are that you're not getting or the results that you want to be getting and you need to go backwards through that model what thoughts are going to help me to get those new.  Else that I want. So again what I really really want you to get from this is that if you're trying to sort of white-knuckle your way into being a better person not only does it not have to be that way does it not have to be that hard but I even would say it's not going to work.  It's not going to work because when you're bringing in that like inner drill sergeant and you're bringing in that inner perfectionist, you don't measure up and nobody is at their best when they're coming from a place of not measuring up that's not where we show up as our authentic selves and at the end of the day your husband or your wife chose. You not the facade you were putting on not the person you were trying to be the person you are.  And the biggest disservice you could do is to not let them be with you now that they chose you now that they chose you at the exclusion of everyone else in the world. They picked just to be with you right? So when I think back about the first couple years married, I don't have regrets about the times that I had like strong emotions and act it out or whatever. I'm not so concerned about that. But what I'm so grateful that I got passed.  Was how it wasn't allowing me to be totally open and vulnerable with my husband because I was trying so hard to play up to this part this perfect wife character that I had in my mind and that's not who we picked. Guess what your husband or your wife is really smart. And even if you think you've been tricking them and that they think they married that perfect person they know better. They know who you are. They know better. So  Let them have you right and again, I'm not saying that that means you just get to act however you want and if I feel that I say it and that whole mentality. I don't think it's healthy. But what I do mean is that this this kind of like this white knuckling this perfectionism this drill sergeant. It's not going to get you where you want to go. Okay. Alright, so thanks so much for tuning in this week. I hope that this resonated with you guys. I'm really as I keep saying, I just love hearing from all of you and getting your feedback. So please keep reaching out. I'm on Instagram at first.  Married, if you haven't yet, please subscribe to the podcast and I'll see you here again next week. Bye. Bye.
Hello and welcome to my daily meditation. My name is Jill and I do a live broadcast of my meditations every day. I'm an app called Periscope and this is the audio version of that meditation. So today's meditation is relatively simple, but can have exponential effects or meaning for some in this meditation. We start in darkness. We start in a cave.  Cool damp cave and from there we venture out into the light. But before we do before we venture out we manifest what it is that we feel we need to manifest that so as we walk out into the world that manifestation comes to life and we get to explore it and then the end of the meditation the word that we truly need comes to light.  So it's an interesting. It's an interesting take on needs and wants and what what we see when we really connect and and the perspective that comes from that so I hope you enjoy today's meditation. I know I certainly did and as always I hope it brings you homeless all my best.  Go and take a nice deep breath in all the way down the belly.  Expand my belly out and slowly exhale.  nice deep breath in  and slowly exhale  last one deep breath in  and slowly exhale  And relax the breath.  Bring you back to the nice even flow through the body.  feel the shoulders relaxed  for that relaxation move down your arms all the way to the ends of your fingers taking that breath moving through the body nice and slow.  I mean that even Rhythm just like an ocean wave.  The breath comes in and tide comes in the breath goes out tide goes out.  Your mind begins to focus on that breath.  Hear the Rhythm of that breath and your ears.  Just like the subtle sounds of the ocean crashing to the shore.  Just going deeper into that relaxed state.  Letting all those external thought sort of push to the side.  As your mind just focuses on that breath.  I'm feeling the rhythm of that breath in your body.  Hearing the sounds of your breath in your ear.  We're going to begin today visualizing ourselves.  sitting in a cave  Cool and dark slightly damp feeling moisture in the ear.  I cannot see outside.  You're far enough into the cave.  or a lot of light from the outside is  it's not penetrating the depth of this cave.  Around you can feel the stone rock.  Might be sitting on it or standing.  As you begin to visualize this I wanted to come in more clearly for you.  As you start to smell earthy damp wet Rock smell.  the coolness of the cave on your skin  under your feet hard Stone feeling very connected to the Earth.  Hello, or sitting or standing in this cave, we're going to be trying to manifest something for ourselves.  And I'm not talking about physical things.  I'm talking about the manifestation of joy happiness. Peace. So you think of an emotion?  You really really need in your life.  Not necessarily want something that you really need.  Perhaps you need balance needs serenity.  You need love.  You need patience.  You need perspective.  You need forgiveness, whatever that is.  Just sit with it here in the depths of this cave and the belly of the Earth.  Where we have no other stimulant around us.  We're completely alone.  Doesn't just have to be one word or motion.  His focus on that thing that you need truly in the depth of your being.  When you're ready, I want you to make your way to the front of the cave.  Finding our way out.  See you make your way you'll notice.  The light is starting to sneak in.  The cave is becoming lighter.  illuminated by the Sun  tell you finally reach the edge of the cave.  For you walk out into the world.  I want you to pause here for a moment.  because when you step out  into that world  That is what you need as what you have asked for.  Try not to shift or change your view.  Except what you see.  This Is Where I Leave You for a while  I'll call you back when it's time.  The countdown from three to one on one. I want you to step into this bright world and explore.  three  two  one  Quinn step out of the cave  begin your exploration.  I'm not going to make you go back to the cave.  Some of you wouldn't go if I asked you to anyway.  But I want you to do is the image that you're seeing or wherever you are in your meditation. I just want you to feel yourself very rooted to the Earth.  Feeling the ground underneath your feet.  I want you to make a mental note of the things that you saw on how they made you feel in your body and your heart.  I want you to place your hands over your heart.  Take a nice deep breath in.  and slowly exhale  There's one word to sum up what you've seen today. I want you to see that word cross the front of your eyes.  Just hold on to it.  Take one last deep breath in.  Your hands in front of you in prayer position and slowly exhale.  Just seeing me being affirmation to yourself.  flus words to yourself  When you're ready, go ahead and open your eyes.  And come back.
episode 48 short-term gain  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dream. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self awareness along the way.  Hello there ladies. I hope everyone's doing well. I learned something this week. And I thought even though I learned it in this totally different context than marriage book or anything like that. I thought this is something that I think all of us could use. So this week is going to be not so much thought work but more just a hack and I have to admit I'm a big fan of hacks. Maybe you guys can all send me your favorite hacks. I would love to hear them. I just think they're so on.  Well, and that's why I probably have this podcast is hacks and half of it is the thought work. Okay. So here's where I came from. So there's this guy named Adam Brown and he's a writer for a website called diatribe and diatribe is a nonprofit organization that helps educate people with diabetes on new tech and ways to manage it and you know just different things that can be helpful in new studies that come out and things like that. So he wrote a book.  Called bright spots and landmines, which I've been reading because as most of you know, I just celebrated my one-year diver SRI of being diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic which of course I did during diabetes awareness month. So I'm like very on Trend over here just as a you know, part of my like self-care and trying to be whole responsible adult Ting adult. I'm reading his book and just trying to get some new ideas and different things. They've been proven to help diabetics. That's where I found this tool, but I think it's such an awesome.  Really really helpful tool. Let's do it Adam Brown writes about the benefit of the short-term goal for a lot of diabetics the way that things might be explained to them is you know, it's really important that you maintain really good glucose control because if you don't then it could you know, cause like really severe health issues down the line or it could shorten your lifespan. We all want another down the line down the line down the line. You'll have a lower quality of life down the  Line, okay, but it's always really far away. Okay, and when you have a person who's sitting there right in front of either the thing that they know if they eat it, it's going to be hard for them to maintain their control or the gym class that they don't want to go to through this basically the sneakers. I don't want to put on right and you're in that moment of wanting to do something and you know, you should because it's like really good for the long-term that shockingly is actually not very motivating for most people most  People are not motivated by a very long-term goal for some of us. Yes, maybe I don't know. I'd like to hear from you. I'm for sure. Not what he talks about is to figure out what's the short-term goal now, I'm sure this is talked about somewhere else. So if you know anywhere else where this is discussed, please share with me and I'll keep stirring it around because this just feels familiar when I was reading it. I was like, I feel like I've heard this before but I tried to do some research and track it down and I couldn't let me give you some examples. So let's say for me as a diabetic if I'm going to eat.  Something that's like very refined even though I'm insulin-dependent and I can take insulin. It's going to be much harder for me to maintain my glucose control. What does that mean? That means I'm going to be feeling lethargic. That means I'm going to have to spend a lot of my time and energy like managing and checking myself to see how I'm doing that means, you know, it might get kind of cranky because I get cranky on my sugars are high, right. So all these different things I might take too much insulin I go low and then I don't feel good. Right and I'm like lose a lot of energy so  Said of thinking. Oh, I don't want to eat this thing because you know, I want to make sure that I'm a healthy eight-year-old. What I could do is I could just say well if I eat this thing then the next like ours could be really hard. Right and so that's a lot more motivating. So let's do it for the positive because I think the negative as a little harder but let's look at the positives. So let's say someone wants to exercise so trying to motivate yourself to exercise because there's some numbers that you want to look good. Next time you go to the doctor or because there's like some certain amount of weight.  You think you're supposed to lose there's some reunions coming up or whatever. It's just not that motivating. Right? But if you start focusing on how you feel after you exercise, what's the rest of your day going to be like after you exercise does it lift your mood? Does it give you more energy? Do you just feel that sense of accomplishment? Like you got it done and off your list. What is it that you're going to get in the short term today or even in the next couple hours that's going to be more motivating than a long-term goal.  What about laundry? I was going to come back to laundry. So I'm just always doing laundry. So I'm thinking about it a lot. Okay, so we're managing laundry or any kind of housework. Sometimes we make it about like us or our abilities as a homemaker and I'm I organized my not organized know my with it or on top of things or not on top of things in my attic controlling control, whatever. Okay, that's all very like big picture.  But you could also think something along the lines of when I go to bed knowing that I put away all the laundry first. I'm going to feel really good because it's going to be off my plate.  Here I am saying with us. Okay. How about this one, which I can't believe we haven't talked about in a really long time, but it's so critical. What about investing in your marriage going out and flexing some uncomfortable muscles? Okay, and I don't care if this means you're picking up his favorite drink from Starbucks or if this means that you're taking him to that restaurant that he loves that you don't really like that much or going to the movie that you hate that he likes to go.  O2 or if it means biting your tongue when you want to say something or it means spending time with your in-laws because it'll make him happy and again not from a place of then maybe a tit-for-tat helping it back to you know, just from a place of I want to be flexing my muscles in my ability to invest to go out of my way to put extra energy and effort in towards my marriage now, it's really important when we're doing this one. By the way. This is a little bit of a tangent that you find something.  Feels authentic for you. Okay, so different people different ones of you out there and in the podcast atmosphere are in very different places in your relationships, right? So for some of you investigator marriage is like you just got married. I mean, what else are you going to do with your energy? You just that's all you want to do with your energy, right? It doesn't even take any energy. It's just all you want to do. Right those of you who've been married longer might take a little bit more conscious effort for some of you who are in a little bit of a rut right now.  It might feel like it's the last thing I want to do. So I want to suggest to those of you it is the best thing for you to do. And when I say invest in your marriage, I don't mean that you need to go out and do some like crazy over the top romantic gesture if that's not how you're feeling right now, right? It could be as simple as like I said the Starbucks drink, it can be something very small and very simple but it's something that you're showing yourself as much as you're showing him.  But he's worth going out of the way for and that more than that. The relationship is worth going out of the way for right it was sort of training ourselves to be more focused and more invested. Okay. So what about that one investing in your marriage? Is it going to be motivating for you to think like oh, but maybe in 20 years we won't have a very strong connection may be right, but what if you think about how it's going to fill in the next two hours? Yeah. Just feeling like a person who puts in a little extra effort feeling like a person who prioritizes  Has this relationship to me? That's a lot more motivating. So for those of you who feel like maybe this is a hack gets a little bit like not being a good student make those of you who want to be perfectionists. This might feel like you're kind of breaking the rules here, right? And so I just want to give those of you permission to embrace this and as always we want to look at like what is my ultimate goal if I go back to my example of a diabetes if my  Ultimate goal is really good glucose management over a long period of time. It doesn't matter that my long-term goal is long-term. What do I need to execute that goal? What I need to execute that goal is to short-term gain. Okay. So yes, you want to have a long term Vision. Do you want to have a goal for where you want to go in your relationship in your life with your health with your job for sure.  But what I want to offer you is that one of the most powerful tools and I've been using this one since I read it and I've been really really liking it and finding it to be very very compelling and helpful. So one of the most important tools for realizing that long-term goal is going to be this the short-term gain, what's it going to be like now? What's it going to be like in the next couple hours or at least by the end of the day? Why is that worth doing this?  And for all of you, I hope you take it and run. I want to hear from you want to hear what examples you use this on? I didn't give any work examples. So I would love to hear that. I mean this could for sure work for not hitting the snooze button or at least not hitting it until your alarm clock runs out of battery and it never goes off or it could go for showing up at work on time. It could go for preparing a little bit more for the meeting right? There's so many places where this could be applied. So I'm really curious to hear.  Where you think you might want to try this out? So please reach out to me as always Kayla at first to marry.com, or you can get me at first you're married on Instagram. I would love to hear from you. Even if you want to like take a picture of it and you know tag me on there so I can see what you're doing. Okay guys, that's your focus for the week identify the long-term goal and then use the tool of a short-term gain to get there have an amazing week. I'll see you here next week. Bye. Bye.
Hey everybody. This is how you are.  I just want to talk to you a little bit today about some happen to me the other day and they've asked me if I tell you about it just because it kind of changed my life. I think it'll change your life. It changed his life changed my aunts life changed everybody's life. So I was down at My Cousin Skeeter shop. But today I walked in there and I was trying to steal couple parts because my Ford ain't working right and Skeeter walk in he didn't know I was doing two skaters kind of stupid and he was like, hey bud. I got something I need to tell you want to take a seat right there.  Tie a seat right there. He said I want to tell you about something that I found out they if you haven't heard about it. I think it's wrapped right time. You did. He says it's called anchor and it's the easiest way imaginable to make podcast and I was like, well, that's like Skeeter. All right. Well, I'm you got my you have my curiosity got my attention. But so he said well, let me talk to you about it. He said it's free. There's creation tools on it. They allow you to record.  Edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer and it will distribute your podcast for you. So it can be heard on Spotify on a podcast many other things many more many more platforms. You can make money from podcast no minimum listenership. It's everything you need to make podcast in one place.  And I started thinking about it and I ain't never heard Skeeter say none of these words before so obviously it took to him pretty well. It must be pretty important to him. So I just want to come on here and tell you that you should download anchor today and you know, just just do with it what you want to do man. Just just have a good time with it. My cousin skaters making a podcast now and he just is just having time with life with it. And you know, I keep stealing his Parts but he's making money from anchor and it kind of offsets it all so he can keep  Even and he can feed his kids and family and all that stuff right there. So it's a download anchor Today and and maybe maybe you can be you know the next Skeeter. I don't know.  My name is indrid cold. What were you hoping to your podcast about creatures or The Unexplained from to suspiciously qualified individuals. I know you were I've been watching these two for long enough that's listening as David Austin take you on the tour Inspirations and theories behind pop culture's most interesting monsters.  Welcome to Tosh.  Hello and welcome to the cryptic cast. My name is Dave chaffins the card-carrying cryptozoologist and joining me is my favorite son of a moth man, Austin O'Connor. How you doing? Awesome? I'm good. I'm doing great. You're doing great. I just interrupted the intro four times in a row. Yes, the things that people won't hear. I think the people want everyone the intro to the things that were lost. Yeah. Yeah in the edit. There's a lot of editing a lot of this week a lot of editing.  Between us sometimes I mean, I think that we things that we don't say. Yeah, I mean it's like hours and hours that and we just like we make it to the conversations flow perfectly. But oh I'm doing great. How are you doing? I'm doing well. I would be I guess it wouldn't be very on-brand for me. If I didn't comment on how hot it is outside still. I think that's the perfect thing. I think if now here's the thing that here's the theory. Mmm. If you didn't say that then I would suspect that there's a  ganger in our midst or a skinwalker sort and man our last episode I said too much they got me they got you and now they've had to go I had to go for reconditioning had to go for reconditioning go to the overseers thing. Yeah, whatever it was whatever it was. I tried, you know, I was respectful last week, but now I don't really I'm just going to crack some jokes. I don't really care accessible jokey jokes just having a joking around good old time for those of you who don't know.  Martin kicked me out. They did. Yeah. Well, it's all out right now. I know but I'm still taking it personally. I think it's I think it was a personal attack to know so the subreddit that we covered last week is now private as a recording. It might be well the day after the episode came out they they had posted about our episode in the subreddit. Yeah, which is funny because it wasn't like I intentionally was like, I'm curious if they'll be able to find it. They found it pretty  Quick. Yep, I was shocked they had to have had like Google alerts or something going on. I have something going because that was really fast. Yeah. So we've been in contact with some of the people as well Alex who is not here today. Yeah. He's obviously under reconditioning right now. But right now it is private the mystery will continue to remain I suppose. I'm eastery although I did I did have a resource reach a  We recently named Norman. Who's it's a fake name stormin Norman Norman reached out to me and gave me some information on the Freemasons some some interesting things about the Freemason conspiracy. So I'm interested to get with Norman your soon and explore more of the Freemason conspiracy. And and yeah poor right now for dick P old dick Prendergast. That's his name. Yes, dick Prendergast we  Learned that we learned the this the mystery the mystery was revealed to us. One of our one of our listeners looked up Richard Pendergast on like some of the different like New Zealand sites. Yeah and find on named actually printer gas, but well I got to give it to them. It's a great narrative like it's a great story. Wonderful. I think we both have concluded as long as well as Alex. I think all three of us concluded that it's like it was just all it's clearly a  It's not real but it's fun though. It's still great. Really fun. Read I think whoever did it very well thought out, you know, it's a fun ride. Everything has to come to an end. All good things must end, right, you know, don't cry because it's over smile because it happened right is the way I like to live if you were a listener in the first see this is the benefit of listening on the first week. See this is my at is we're gonna cover stuff and you may not know you do not know how  Since its of this stuff is and now this is gone. It was about a week. Yep, time-sensitive a week and it was gone. You want me to read it, which is what we all theorized would happen Yeah, we actually literally said I bet this will be gone. You're like I bet this when this comes out they're gonna end up like a lean everything and yeah. Yeah, we're good at what we do. It's it's cool. It's fine. It's whatever it's but yeah, but yeah, it's really hot outside back to that. It's very warm.  It into here recently. We've been doing this kind of traveling all over the place like always it seems well, I mean we went we went to we went to a festival together went to the Mothman Festival good time. Lots of cosplaying it was incredibly crowded. Yeah, the gate wasn't nearly as hot as last year was actually very comfortable very kind. I was shocked I was amazed but there were a lot of people it was impossible to walk.  Which is good. I'm happy for them. But that when we left that traffic going into town. Yeah, like backed up all the way on the interstate. Yeah, it was pretty rough. But that's good A lot of people go into the festival. It seems to be growing. I'm curious how they're going to evolve that for more people as the as the moth Mania continues. Yeah, they're gonna have to change some sort of traffic pattern or they're going to have to prepare for that better because that was pretty bad even when we got there. We got there early.  And we had to park pretty far away and the traffic was already picking up. So I don't know but it was fun A lot of people dressed up as a lot of different things that I didn't pertain to the Mothman, but I was you know, I was there for it. So Negan, it's like 3D games. We saw like three negan's. Yeah. There was some guy just dressed up as  I think there was I saw a Freddy Krueger. Yeah, these are Jason. There were a lot of Men In Black that obviously does pertain to it. But a lot of them were the same as last year dedicated though. They were just kind of stand in the middle of the street with their hands crossed in front of them just staring off into the distance. My favorite moment was when so we milled around and innate and look at some different stuff, but we watched a costume contest and there was yeah it was in like the real young ones and he was dressed up like  Vault dweller and they were like, all right, we're going to do the one who they had. Like. The one thing is that too many categories for the contest. Yes. It was a bit cutest one and the coolest one and the but it was for each age group. Yeah, so there were just it was really it was very kind of awkwardly setup. I wish that they would just do the age groups and give out like first second and third place. Yeah, just give you better go for it. Yeah, call it a day trade really dragged on a bit really dragged off, but the questions you didn't really know.  No, you know what kids say the darndest thing. Yes, because this little kid that was dressed up like a vault dweller. Everybody was like, where are you from? I was like, oh, I'm from Milton West Virginia or oh, oh, I'm from Huntington and they hand this kid the mic and they're like, where are you from? He goes up the Vault. He's a fresh out of the Vault. Yeah, and then he like crossed his arms. It was kind of like one of those deal with it. Memes were like the sunglasses shop.  Like the sunglasses drop down and like the do be like yep floats into his mouth. That was like one of those but knows it was it was cool. We had some pretty good barbecue. Yeah. That's a good food truck good. I think they had the I feel like the food was there was more there were more options this year. I think I think that we experience the the curse of Chief cornstalk though. Yeah, the the amount of bees Kai there so many bees or they were yellow  It's yeah everywhere every time we sat down to eat there were like three of them flying around so but it was fun. You wanted to take a picture with cornstalk statue. I refused because I am not I'm not about that. I think if he's listening Chief cornstalk, I'm sorry that he even thought about taking a picture with your statue. I will not disrespect you like that. So if you don't know she cornstalk put a curse on the town of or allegedly alleged now, I don't know what  Lady put a course on the town of Point Pleasant which created a number of different problems for over the years including Mothman, which is more often a problem. Whereas Mazda wooshin he put He it was not allegedly it was he was like Kobe dropping 82 in one game. He he that was like his his MVP performance was that cursed because it's still happening. I don't know. I don't like Crossing Bridges and to Point Pleasant. I do not like it like it not one bit nada.  A fan not a fan at all. And then when they had that traffic on the bridge going in when we left not a fan of that either. Nope, not me too. Many people too many too many Cuts as they say in Martin New Zealand. There's too many eyes on this. Yeah, which is my buddy. There's too many eyes on the bloody phones ringing off the hook. I saw that all the time like, he's calling you bro, My Buddy Guy Williams dick Pilon today, which I watched more of his videos and I enjoy is the life.  Enjoy his videos particularly. I don't know. There's like a New Zealand kind of feels like West Virginia in a way. It does I could see that just like the way that they were talking about like he did a whole segment where they were being cell phone service like this community and it was like they all have internet but he's like, what are you gonna do when you have cell phone service in they're like not damn thing. What are you gonna do? Wow?  Funny though. I like him a lot. But yeah, so we went to that I got to you know went to the Marshall game this last weekend. We got destroyed by Cincinnati. It's cool. We're all here. We're all here where I can't tell you. We all had fun. I can't tell you what's happening in the Wide World of Sports. Yeah, and I it's a hundred percent support the Kentucky Galaxy if the Frankfurt Galaxy from overseas, Kentucky got Germany the Kentucky Galaxy. Okay. Wow.  Colonel Sanders here. I will send them and I support I will I'll send your regards the gamma Galaxy. But yeah, I don't know I'm ready for fall. We're getting some fall color, but the temperatures aren't really dropping. I wouldn't say we're getting fall Clara so that it's all really hot and really dry. And the leaves are just like slowly turning just Brown. Well, the here's the good news. I think we're going to this is my prediction. I think we're going to get some rain. Yeah, I think it's going to be a miracle. I think we're going to get some rain. I think a  Two places in West Virginia right now do have fall color because it had they haven't had a drought. I think it's going to turn around. I saw your I want us to I went up to some of the higher elevations last week. I was up around like 4548 hundred feet above sea level and it was beautiful Reds and oranges and yellows all kinds of stuff. Yeah, so I think it's going to catch up. So I would you sacrifice to the fall gods. Did you like get your UGG boots out and poor?  Pumpkin spice latte over them and then like yes, the stab them with like a yes turkey foot or so all of the above. Okay, I am ready. I am pumped. I am just giddy for fall. Well, I'm getting bad fall. But before we even talk about fall, let's get the sound effect.  Have you ever watched The Conjuring?  No, so I've never made you watch The Conjuring. No, I don't mess with demons. You don't mess the demons whatsoever. So The Conjuring is a movie. That is one of my favorite horror movies. It's got Patrick Wilson who's delightful and just about everything that he does. Yeah, it's popular if you like Annabelle, I suppose I noticed that either Annabelle. So all these movies are based off of these real demonologists. So they're like real people.  It's just like a done up for the movies. It's like a dramatization of these things that actually happened to them. So this particular story is about these two demonologists the warrants fighting Bigfoot. Okay, the Warrens had apparently been contacted by a news reporter at the same time who said something in the Wilds of Tennessee had been menacing terrified locals in a poverty-stricken area way.  Way out in the Boondocks the witnesses had said that their Tormentor was none other than the legendary giant hairy wild man called a Bigfoot and other Tennessee is actually quite a hotbed for Bigfoot sightings. The warrants had never been particularly interested in investigating the creature until then the warnings headed out to the heavily wooded back water Hill Country. He's tough now I try to get through that to check it out the area where the sightings had occurred was described as a little more than a collection of flimsy Shacks without running.  Water and with lights provided by a single electric wire that meandered through Lorraine. Who's the the supposed to psychic and Patrick has more Patrick Patrick Wilson. Thought that's one thing but Lorraine who's the most like one says she felt very sorry for these people and their abject poverty and want to do something to help them. So the Warrens spent the day asking them about what they thought and what they had seen among many reports one of the residents claimed that just the day before a massive ape-like.  Like Beast appeared from behind a tree and grabbed a or try to grab a two-year-old child after which it was chased Away by men with clubs and the whole settlement was completely terrified of whatever that was. The warrants went about venturing out into the surrounding Wilderness to investigate the landscape of the area was described as nothing but vast Hills and for so impenetrable they seem beyond the reach of civilization and the next morning when they headed out the thick trees were  Ethereal fog to lend its rather otherworldly dreamlike Ambience. The warrants had their team headed out into the murky Wilderness and spent most of the day uneventfully climbing about and struggling through the brush, but this would change when they stopped for a rest at a clearing around 4:30 p.m. They first noticed that something had smashed down the tall grass and that was been laraine claim to have seen the Beast and even made telepathic contact with it quote.  He did in fact appear to be a fusion of man and ape at all slope shouldered animal with very long arms that were covered with almost shaggy hair. His face was flat and presented with a protruding bony shelf above the eyes to things about him were especially disturbing first his eyes which were shown with intelligence compassion and fear second his ability to project images telepathically into Lorraine's mind not so dumb the know  This evening those so-called dumb animal is able to accomplish such predictions Lorraine instantly knew that she was dealing with creature who despite his fearsome an ugly appearance was not the prehistoric Beast. Most people assume him to be Lorraine would claim that the creature had sent a flurry of images and emotions into her head like a projector onto a screen including its standing and a cave by a river with a family of similar creatures suppose. That's like Harry and the Hendersons and an image of an injured foot which it  somehow conveyed was keeping it from seeing its family again as well as waves of feeling of isolation and sadness. It's all rather speculative account and also interesting in it fits with similar reports of telepathic Bigfoot, which are more common than you think. What was it Lorraine saw was it even real and any sense at all Ed warrant her husband would later speculate the bigfoot was not even flesh and Bone creature at all, but rather a tulpa also known as a thought form the concept originally comes from Tibetan.  ISM and is basically involves a visible construct entirely from the mind and belief of human beings basically willed into being with enough will and thought they are even said to be able to take on a life of their own become a sort of independent Apparition that can exist apart from its creators and could be seen and even interacted with in the world around them.  So told us are you familiar with tulpas at all?  Now know how do you feel about all this? What do you what do you what were your what's that was something that was so that was definitely something getting some telepathic images from big guy. I I keep coming back to like you have like why is nobody filming anything glass? What like why I got a team of people in the 70s. I don't know it was that when was that when that was but I think they were active in the 70s and 80s. Okay. I for some reason thought  Was recent I don't like this is this is just an old an old story. Yeah. I for some reason I kept thinking that was now right but like I don't know telepathic sure. I don't know. So my thought is for Mothman as we always bring it back to Mothman if we thought about Mothman hard enough and long enough the Mothman would appear of course. Yeah, I don't think so because I think about him all the time.  But it was so whoa. Wait a second. How often do you think about?  Every waking second of every day. I'm thinking about mod then I wake up I think about Mothman I eat breakfast I think about my - if it's our true old YouTube video the the the the girl that's like a doing the eHarmony profile and she's like, I love cats that's just the kind of cat. Yeah, that's me. So anyway, I'm a cat lover and I like to run. I'm sorry. I'm thinking back. She's like starts.  He's like, I'm sorry. I'm like thinking but I'm not man lover know. It's like I wake up and I think about this big red eyes and I'm trying not to I'm fine. I'm fine. Like I run I'm I just keep thinking about those wings and he's just so cute and no, but I so if we think about Mothman hard enough  Is that make him a Kapoor? Yeah, kind of like Tulsa. They only like piece of media. They can think that deals with is Twin Peaks, which I'm probably like that's like I can any point of the show could be like, oh yeah Twin Peaks. Oh, yeah lying at 20 weeks, whatever specifically mentions like thought forms in like beings like so the villain in that the spoiler alert is a tulpa that's like a thought-form and that's like I think in Tibetan Buddhism that is like it was part of the mysticism part of  That yeah, I just thought that was a very like weird little story of these people go out of the woods and she has a psychic encounter with no and that it's very specific the psychic encounter the fact that he projected his family and then his foot being hurt. It's very weird. It also sounds like she was very very high on something. Well, she's like an experienced and so like she's done all these different things. And so this is like, I mean, this is like a side quest, you know, yeah, this is like well,  I mean, I'm just I think personally do I think that there is something Bigfoot esque out there somewhere or was yes, I don't believe most of these encounters that people talk about that. I think I think I think that there is a high possibility that there could be a Bigfoot ish creature like because just think about how much of the world that we don't know. Yeah. There's a lot of forests. There's a lot of weird stuff that could that could happen.  There's a lot of weird animals that could be there still discovering stuff. So maybe we even have we ever have we even all been to every corner of West Virginia. Yeah. It's like some of the hills probably people still have never liked actually actually walked up into and yeah, so and if they have I mean it's probably been like what 300-400 years. Yeah, like it's there are there are Hills and West Virginia, Virginia North Carolina all through the Appalachian Mountains the Rockies different mountain ranges.  Is an America that I'm sure people don't go we don't know. What's there there could be something 20 miles from here that we don't even know. I mean, I mean Sheepsquatch is a good example. Mmm. So who knows? I think a lot of the reports are made up but I but I do believe that there is something out there that exist like that. I think it was interesting that they're like, we're going to look for bigfoot all we found Bigfoot. Actually. We didn't find Bigfoot. We found a thought-form. Yeah. It was telepathically communicating with us.  It's yeah, once we've gone down that that that pathway it's like, okay. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'll give you that I give you that one. Yeah, why not? No, but yeah, it's interesting. I guess. I don't know not really buying it though. You don't you don't you well, what's your experience of telepathy? Have you ever like met like somebody who can do like some my reading or have you ever gone to like a seance or like yeah, you know like a psychic you ever seen the movie Matilda. Yeah. What are you kidding me? It's one of my favorite movies.  That's my experience with telepathy.  That's a but it's a good movie. That's good. Just have a crush on Miss. Honey. Still do actually still do still see those going strong for Change and things never change with that. We will get into an ad from our sponsors. Have you given robots around table a shot yet? This is the new show where the hosts from the robots radio network podcasts all of your favorite hosts get together every week and they talk a little bit more deeply about some of the things going on in the games in the things that they're enjoying.  Recently, so if you're looking for a fun show talking about games entertainment with all of your favorite hosts and also a really wacky competition at the end of each episode give robots Roundtable a shot. It's available on iTunes and Spotify and basically everywhere.  Can we can we talk about something that's very near and dear to my heart. Yeah, we can the Ghostbusters movies. That's what we're I want to talk about when there's something strange in the neighborhood Who you gonna call? You know, my favorite part about that song is that it took me years to realize okay. Yeah. What's your favorite part about that song? It's a great song. It's like, you know, it's a tradition like it's right. You can listen to it all year, but around Halloween, you'll hear it all the time Bubba Ray Parker jr.  Mmm went to the studio one day and decided that in this song He's going to yell busting makes me feel good and he just put it in there. He just put it in the song and he left it there and it's 2019 and it's still there. He just goes bust it makes me feel good at the end of the song. What is that? Even what does it even mean? It could mean so many that mean but Glory reference. Nobody knows what it means. But I mean  If I can think of things that I think it's funny and what it means but you know, he could have just like in the Rhythm he could have said ghost busting makes me feel good. But no he says it makes me feel good. Yes. Oh Charlotte. ER. I mean, that's a pattern. That's a legendary move by Ray pollutants name me a better theme song name me.  I personally there's Ghostbusters I can think of that and then in Matilda was like Mona way doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo all the way that I think that's good. That's another Matilda. I feel like you're not going to like Harry Potter or like Star Wars. Well, okay. So like Ghostbusters like it literally like it's like their song. Yeah, and then the theme song it's like if they were to come out to the plate to hit the ball with a bat.  You know, how you doing the game of Base? Yeah, they play that.  I walk up song a walkout fun. Yeah, that's what I mean. Well, I'm so first in sports. I just know these things, you know. Yeah Ghostbusters that it's that was I don't know but I love the Ghostbusters movies. I remember that when we went to the Mothman Festival the first time we saw the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Yes, and you like had like a like I could tell like you freaked out a little bit but in your brain it just like you were so excited. I was a little late again another this kids.  That opened the Nintendo 64 Christmas that was kind of you when you saw the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. You were like, yeah. I just I remember as a kid watching Ghostbusters and is when I was really little and I guess I didn't really like at the time get it as much when I was at little but I loved the movie Just because of that scene when the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man comes out. I thought it was hilarious.  Hilarious as a kid and I still think it's hilarious. I think it's one of the more ridiculous because that movie it was like  In any other movie having a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man all of a sudden show up would ruin the movie. So in the research for today, I was watching some video essays on just Ghostbusters in general and there was this one guy that was essentially talking. I think his name was Patrick Williams and he did a whole video that was essentially like Ghostbusters is the only movie that is literally about nothing. Yeah. No one involves like there is no point. That's Sigourney Weaver and  Mary kind of had their not it's like it's never like this analyze. She the only thing that they came up with was that she learned to like stay in him more. He still giant jerk at the end of the day there. Yeah, like that's still so his thing it's the only movie and but like it's kind of like Seinfeld like they kind of Revel in yeah the lack of it's like it's not like about like, yeah science versus religion or their like postmodern. I guess you could even say like  It's really not like a it's just there. It's just there's not really an overall destination drawing painting and wildly successful. Yeah. Well, I just I don't know. It's just hilarious the this the scene itself when it's like there's like the cryptic message from what is it Gozer the no. Yeah goes. Our that goes area and or whatever and they're like thinking about it like, oh wait no.  So whatever pops in our head and then you just look at Dan Aykroyd just standing there with his eyes rolled. It just cracks me up there. Like what did you do? Ray. What did you do? What do you think about it? It's like identify identify with the Ghostbusters. If someone told you don't think about anything.  You're gonna think about something ridiculous like right off the bat I would wear and he does and it's very rare. It's relatable and they're all normal guys who don't have any they don't have any idea what they're doing other than the fact that they're good at science, but they though they're all good at science, but do they like even need science? Yeah this way they very much like they have the scientific knowledge, but they go into everything just sort of like well, we're gonna go try this. Yeah, like they walk up like 50 flights of stairs to get to the top of  Get to that thing and then just kind of have zero plan whatsoever. They just have their little machines. So they just rolled. I feel like that would be me. I would just feel like you know, what like we're gonna give it the old College try but maybe who knows we could all die. I don't know. Yep. So, yeah, but and then the Slimer I think is what we kind of like, I guess challenged each other if you want to do a Ghostbusters episode and so we were thinking of ways we could do it and so we  We were each tasked with coming up on some like real-world Inspirations and like ideas and just kind of like Norma, you know, the normal situation. Yeah, it comes to us for both Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. So I want to start off and adult the point of it is we're supposed to give our findings and at the end of it we're going to have a little debate and see who would win in a fight and I'm curious of how that will go down because a lot of this information. We're just going to pull from what we tell each other and then feel  You to come on disk or Twitter or whatever and think about who you want to win fight or I could lie about all of this and you never know. You never know unless he did the research part of it. All right, Austin, what have you got for me for this? Fella knows State Puft Marshmallow. So I think we should start with the Slimer because it's actually I actually more so just have I took my took the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and more so was like, what else would be terrifying? Okay, because  The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man himself. It's pretty self-explanatory. He's just a marsh. He's day Puft Marshmallow Man. Yes. It's in the name. He's just a pup Marshall and mass and overall it all stems from the fact that Ray is told by goes are they ghosts are in second of his name that he said we get it. We need to make sure we do it correct or told not to think of like whatever you think of will be sort of the destroyer of  World like a tulpa. Yeah, and so he thanks accidentally. He's like it just popped in there. We used to he said something about roasting. It was it was I should know this off the top of my head. He said he said I couldn't help it. It just popped in there and he said I tried to think of one of the most harmless things something I loved from my childhood something that could never ever possibly do.  Destroy it. Mr. Stay Puft. We used to roast a puff marshmallows on the fire it Camp wakanda. That's like just something about that scene. So I didn't really know what angle to take with it because it's not really like a there's like destroyer of the world blah blah blah, but I have so after you talk about this climber. I have something fun. I want to discuss that I think other people could jump in on discussion with so Slimer. I actually found it should be pretty dry just down from  Slammer so it's first shown and it's not even named Slimer. The first film is just like it's just a ghost they get but the idea was that they were going to create a ghost that was like Bluto and Animal House. So that's the John Belushi character and oftentimes in production and Dan Aykroyd several times afterwards would refer to the ghost as the ghost of John Belushi. I thought makes sense there's fire. So I have on here the notes he eats a lot and he haunts a  Tell well that's quite an informative. So he runs into Peter Venkman and the first film in leaves him covered in ectoplasm, which I will get to that and on the set. They refer to him as the onion head ghost or the potato ghost just because of one he was smelling like an onion and to his head was shaped like a potato. So they named the ghost Slimer in The Real Ghostbusters cartoon as sort of a series mascot, so they didn't have the idea for it until they made the cartoon. Yeah, then they came out and they were  Okay, we need to name this and then when they did Ghostbusters 2 they try to incorporate more of what the cartoon did into it so that they can like have a thing and so they had this like whole subplot for Slimer and they ended up cutting a lot of that for him. But he's so he was only like in like he had like two major scenes movies those any driving a bus or something like that. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, but he like a whole subplot originally planned for that, but they had to cut it because they you know  They don't want to go overboard with it. I can write you know, they don't want to get all Simon. So there's two theories of where like the origin of this ghost like the Slimer goes came from so the first one is from in the comic books. They go to explain that he is this Old King named King ra Mills, which reveals backwards is Slimer and that he just ate Bunch ate a bunch until it.  I'd and then Peter Venkman has to go back went back in time and convince him to stop eating but then there is no Slimer goes to help him. And so then they had to fix that somehow. I try to get into this comic book situation. It didn't work out. The better version was Paul feig who's one of the writers for the new Ghostbusters movie the one with Kate McKinnon and most of McCarthy said that he wrote out an origin story and they were going to play it but it got cut from the movie was like fully scripted ready to go. Yeah, so  that he was a gangster that would frequent a restaurant in the man food a waiter ticked him off and he killed the waiter. So the gangster was sent to jail and executed and he came back to essentially haunt the restaurant and eat food. So when the Ghostbusters first arrived this Kate McKinnon and the group say Kate McKinnon because she's great when the Ghostbusters first arrived they shoot the ghost with their what is the proton beams or whatever.  You don't you don't whatever they are. I've gone I've gone back and forth with what with what they are. I've read a lot about Ghostbusters. So please excuse me. They shoot a but the beams are too hot at this ghost. So hey, they burn off his legs. Yeah, and then the ghost becomes bloated look like Slimer. Okay, so I'm laze Slimer.  Social commentary on gluttony, I'll get to that okay here in a bit. So first I was like, how do I do this? I like how do I go and like figure out what is going on with him? It's like, okay. So obviously, he's slimy that's number one any covers Peter Venkman and act Applause. Mm. And then he also eats a lot. Yeah, but then he might be a gangster. So I started with the gangster thing. I lift up Gangster ghosts.  Not a lot of gangster ghosts fun fact, there's a lot of people killed by gangster goes. Ah, which I'm not surprised about. Yeah, and then I was like, okay, let me like, let me like shorten that search. That's like just New York, New York. No gangster ghost. A lot of people that are killed by gangsters. Also learned Anderson Cooper's house in New York haunted by a fireman that hung himself. So there you go. That's he has enough money to move. Why would you not move because he likes live in this Old Firehouse in the looks cool. I don't understand that.  I will never understand living in a house that's on it. He likes it. You know, it brings excitement to his life. He works for CNN he gets to go all over the place. Well, you know, he doesn't lead that exciting of life as you as you know, when he's out covering literally everything. Yeah, whatever. So then that lead became absolutely nothing. I didn't find anything. However, I started to end this the the train of ectoplasm which I was very curious about which I have no clue other than it's like a gooey.  Slimer lip that's like and the fact that they had the ecto-1 was kind of the you know the car and it's like oh ectoplasm ha ha ha. Yeah. So my first search result was this YouTuber  It was like the classic YouTuber like the what's up guys? I'm here. We're gonna give put a like And subscribe down. We're - that like button smash that like, let me know what you think in the comments below. Make sure you subscribe like we're gonna make some fluffy slime at 3 a.m. So this dude is he's two cans of Barber Saul he's squirting of it this pan and he like it's like all like heavily lit like this dude has like 14 million subscribers like this is like a YouTuber. Yeah like through and through  And then he has these little electronic candles all around where he's making this lemon. So he's pressing up the slide and I got to the point of video where the candles mysteriously God. He's like. Oh no, what kind of slime did we make we made it the witching hour? Oh no, what kind of things you're like? Okay. Well, I'm gonna shut my computer now I so I decided that I wanted to go a little more what's a good word researched, you know hybrid research-based research-based ectoplasm.  So what ectoplasm is is spiritual energy externalized there is nothing. There's nothing that says it's lime. It's just spiritual energy externalized. So like any sort of like a physical like ghosts. It is predominantly formed by physical mediums to like like a seance or Long Island medium or whatever you are when they're in a trance state so it's like yeah evidence of something, okay.  Okay spiritual happening. Okay. So ectoplasm on many occasions has been proven to be fraudulent many mediums had used methods of swallowing and regurgitating cheesecloth textile products smooth with potato starch. And in other cases, the ectoplasm is made from paper cloth that egg white or butter muslin. So this is like a proof is getting Wild Man idioms. This is a proof that mediums were cool or  We're with it back in the early nineties. Cool, man. Are you cool late 1800 by producing this ectoplasm whenever they did their little bits. So it was like Just an Illusion. Yeah. It was like, oh, this is the classroom that you the ghost left when they were all what is that this has this is evidence of ghosts. They're all like he's cloth. I just vomited up there like holding hands around the table. She's like, all right, I can sense something and then there's like her like cousin Billy's like behind the curtain.  Like throws a bunch of stuff onto the table Yemen or so ago still be holding hands and then we'll just start barfing up cheesecloth. And if you were like what the heck is going on and then after they're done barfing up the cheesecloth and they'll be like, it's your father. Hey, look, it's your dad look at him. So there is disgusting. There's this lady named Eva carrier. They claimed she could conjure ectoplasm to create an image. So like she could conjure it and it would create an actual image rather than just being like goop or whatever. Yeah.  Reporter David West investigated that the images that she conjured were two dimensional faces that have been clipped from the back of magazines which included Woodrow Wilson King Ferdinand of Bulgaria and various other modern popular pop culture figures in the 1920s. This lady was literally just like crumpling up some magazine paper be like look at this ectoplasm. It's like a face of Woodrow Wilson was nobody like it took that guy to tell everybody that it's like Franz Ferdinand or like Woodrow Wilson. Yes.  Yeah, well, whatever. So again, just like I people really were dumb. I think like it's just her like look at this thing. It's like stage effects that I guess her so like involved in the world of like sound effects and Stage effects and like digital effects all this stuff that it's like when we see stuff that's out of the norm like we have to make up an explanation for it like that. It's like back in the day. It's like if you saw a cellphone, what would you call that? I sometimes like I If I buy something new  Like like a new phone or like some new piece of technology. Sometimes I randomly will think like what have you brought someone from like 1815 what did to 2019 for like 10 minutes or even like in my car? I have like the middle console with like the like backup camera and like digital this. Yeah. I'm like, what would someone just 10 minutes into 20 just 10 minutes in 2019 and they go back they're going to think it's all like witchcraft like weird like if your  if I put a seance and they start barfing up cheesecloth. Yeah, I'm gonna be like that's totally active plasm and they're totally possessed by a demon. I'm gonna be that's I think even today if they would still be we're at yeah, I'm going to be like hold up a minute that one I will give them that one is pretty weird. And that's actually you know, that's clever it's gross but it's clever clever the one with the newspaper thing that's stupid. You stupid. If you fell for that you're stupid. It was particularly popular in Europe. That was it was  He was the thing. That was big then true. So Danish medium. Oh, yeah, this is what Danish medium Mina Crandon known for producing an ectoplasm hand was no excuse me was known for producing a neck spasm hand from her stomach which waved in the darkness. So it was like the hand and Poltergeist, you know, the kind of comes out TV and swats and grabs the things so biologists examined this hand and found out that it was just carved.  Deliver that she had like puppet it up to move that rascal little rascal little rascal and then I also so I looked into all this ectoplasm stuff and then I looked into a core. Yeah just because it was in the search results and also reminded me of a key which is kind of what I think about Slimer and it turns out that it cor I didn't know. What a core was is God's blood. So like what a hero goes to like kill a beast or something. They may drink some liquor, which is  The blood of Zeus and they will blame powers and such which is not really a disclaimer. I don't think the other thing that got me thinking about was Luigi's Mansion. Yeah. So in the new Luigi's Mansion, you're already familiar with the classic GameCube. I played it you played it. So you're okay. He's walking around. He's got a vacuum gets ghost much similar to a Ghostbusters. So in the new one, he's a partner that you can play the second character named GUI G was an echo plasm version.  Luigi so now I'm going to be thinking about why play this game that it's like vomit Luigi you done you done messed around done ruined it for yourself animal livered Luigi. I'm here to help out this for the under and down the hall read the whole nother level to get it does it does so that's what was my trip into ectoplasm. The next thing I have are hungry ghosts, which I learned earthing that there are a ton of hungry ghosts and it's a  Big worldwide on not particularly world was more like an East Asian kind of thing. So hungry ghosts are the demon like creatures described in Buddhist. Tailless Hindu Sikh and Jain I'm probably putting all those names text as the remnants of the Dead who are afflicted with insatiable desire, hunger or thirst as a result of bad. Deeds were evil intent carried out in their lifetimes one story is of a rich man who traveled selling sugar cane juice one day a monk came to his house.  Looking for some juice to cure an illness the man had to leave. So he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence instead of doing this. She secretly urinated in the monks Bowl added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived. He poured the bowl out and left when the wife died. She was reborn as a Hungry Ghost. I thought that was the weirdest like that is like like  They home and get him. I'm gonna get her. All right. I see it's like the they poured out of the boat left years later. Just woman dies. You know what you peed in a bowl and you try to feed to somebody. So now you're hungry go. So now you're a Hungry Ghost. You know, what you little rascal that's what you get is what you get. That is an interesting story. So the seventh month of the Chinese calendar holds a Hungry Ghost Festival according to tradition during this month the gates of hell are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the Earth.  The Earth where they seek food and entertainment these ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who had forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their family's tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn quote hell money. No money that quote how money is a valid currency in the Underworld and helps ghost to live comfortably in the afterlife people. Also bear in other forms of Joss paper.  Such as paper houses cars and televisions to please the ghosts.  So I getting weirder and weirder man, I got there and I was like I could go I probably all day on this Hungry Ghost business. So it seems like it's just like spirits that like we're bad. I was expecting like spirits of her like gluttonous. It's like no this lady just like peed in the bowl. She's just a little little trickster. That's yeah. I got a little weird there but it's like a comment like hungry ghosts are like a common thing depicted in in the Eastern religions, which I think is interesting. Well as  It is it was I I respect the effort. You went down that rabbit hole and found that yes. I also thought that it was kind of like The Walking Dead like maybe the Americanized version is like zombies of that. Yeah, and I have one last thing to talk about ghosts that like to eat what do ghosts eat for supper? What spook Eddie?  I hate you so much. Oh my God. I want to like throw up after that. That was like the epitome of  Pretty good Kelly. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that's that's one of the things that I found in this I went down some rabbit holes to find this goodness. I thought there was going to be like one of those like boobies boobies. Forgot. What the hell? Yeah question to that is but boobies. Yeah. What's a somehow we having? Oh, hi. He knows something about  Allergic just something they're allergic to what type of bees are they allergic to boot a ghost allergic to IVs. Yah-ha-ha-ha-ha her that like first grade. But yeah. All right. Let me hear about so I took a much I didn't go down a rabbit hole. It's Island out a rabbit hole in my own mind. Okay more thing. That's more fun. I think we thought about the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and how ridiculous. Yes. They Puff Marshmallow Man becoming you know 350 foot tall right monster being is  There's no like Stay Puft brand marshmallows. Like in real life right there. Is there is what's this? What's this? Is it as a just marshmallows? There's something special. I'm pretty sure it's just a puff marshmallows. I don't know if I think that they used to there used to be like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I don't think they do that anymore, but I could be wrong. I don't know if there ever was an actual stay-puft marshmallow man. But so I started thinking okay and we kind of discussed this. What other  Like company mascots would be absolutely horrifying. Yeah in that form of coming to destroy your city. Yes, and so I put a list together here.  I'm ready for the number one literally any of the Chuck E cheese animatronics.  Think about this think about seeing like the like eyes that are like closing and opening but like you can tell it's like like just the slits that open and close and then like rocking very weirdly and sink like up and down and back and forth like bending over. All right, because those used to give me nightmares. Well, they have those at the Huntington Mall. You know that well I Billy Bob's yeah and right next to the mall there and there they are like 30 years old falling apart even more horrifying. Yeah.  Like kind of like Five Nights at Freddy's there in like 80s at tires though. There's that then I thought about the Michelin Man and how similar as the way you just said he is so stay-puft marshmallow man. He's like kind of like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man Tech long-lost cousin Joe Camel Camel cigarettes, Joe Camel. Who's Joe Camel the camel with the sunglasses on it's like the Camel cigarettes logo. I'm familiar with the camel. I didn't know that he wore sunglasses. Yeah, Joe Camel in the 90s big sunglass guy big sunglass like a freak.  Me out because like I feel like he just looks like he's gonna steal my girlfriend like he's like too cool. He's like, he's like Mister Steal yo girl. Yeah, so I'm like, all right, Joe Camel and then like I hadn't thought about this a long time about the Jolly Green Giant. Oh, so he's already big from like the canned foods like he's already big. So like what's gonna happen to him? He liked why I mean that's like double big. Yeah. He's buff to the Jolly Green Giant plus Stay Puft was slow Jolly Green Giant looks like he like works out a lot. He's pretty quick. Yeah.  Quick twitch muscles, like if I got this is like his like body here is party turned into a forest and like you got a lot done. But he also here's the thing. He like wears like a like a like a loincloth skirt. So you looking up at that like that's not something you want. That's not something you want to see and hear and I mean if that's a large to be fair, actually I kind of would want to see it. I'm not like rock I'll be honest. We're all friends here. I would actually probably be like they like, you know, I was impressive that's some pretty cool shelter a giant for you Jolly drink at Green Giant.  Let's see. Mr. Clean. Mr. Clean. He scares me. So like as a giant bald All White Everything like gonna scare me probably right? I think about Hitman. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's like the old version like very like bald head like very like androgynous kind of face where it's like he is just it's like I like Slenderman, it's kind of like Slenderman. Yep. I think that yeah it is. I don't know. So there's  That this one's kind of self-explanatory, but the Kool-Aid man. Oh, yeah, he's gonna cause some damage she's going to do some damage pretty quickly just busted through buildings the hamburger help her hand, you know, that is kind of creepy. He's weird. Yeah, he's got that little face and now I'm thinking about it and I'm thinking about it. He the Hamburger Helper handle. He's always smiling. It looks like just very they could look just like what happens when he grabs something.  It is face is right there. Does he bite it? What does he do? What is he there was a what was that game that you it was that you're a you were a hand I talking about. Are you are you talking about Glover right now lover you totally talking about lover on the Nintendo 64 lover. Heck. Yeah, dude, that game was crazy. You had the ball and he had left dribble the ball. It was impossible to control. Yep, and it's like everyone's a shame the ball and you had like Marbles and bowling. I think I had it on PC and it was really difficult. It's tough.  This one is similar to step up Pillsbury Doughboy. He's so cute and innocent. He's so cute. And so he's big and he's destroying your city. So we're you like him as he look huh? I think it has to be technically you remember the Quiznos like the little sponge monkey things that would like sing the songs or a really creepy. No, not remember the music. Listen, look them up. Everybody. Laughs you don't remember they were like, they had these like weird little like gritty voices and they would sing about Quiznos and the early 2000s those when  Look it up. You'll see why okay, I'm gonna let's all let's all make a note and we're all going to go look up the sponge monkeys from Quiznos. So the Hamburglar and or Grimace Grimace is just like a big purple blobs. Yeah grimaces definitely freaked because he just looks like he's like Barney without what does he do? What's he what's he there to do you like? Obviously, we know the motivations of Hamburg earlier. It's to get the hams and the burgers. Yeah, so but Grimace would be pretty creepy.  I used to that was like a Halloween costume that I have like on hand. It's like one of those like on hand if I need a Halloween costume pinch. I immediately can become the hamburger at a drop of a hat. I can immediately transformed the Hamburglar this year. Well, I was acting the Hamburglar several years. Last Halloween addressing is Steve Harrington and bust into your apartment. Yeah a designer. I wasn't busted out. That's true. I was playing Red Dead. I remember this. Yeah, so the Hamburglar Grimace and then last on my list Jared from Subway.  That's his severe. It's just a serious. That's the scariest one scariest walks in and you're like walking through the city, but he's got his pants like he's holding it like his old pair of pants off to the side still showing how large they are. You could like fit the Statue of Liberty and two of them inside of the pants right and him just, you know, being a gigantic pedophile but it's the the whole like large like, you know, Mistake by marshmallow, man. I have some absent thoughts.  If people like the Burger King The King oh with like the yeah the face and everything. I would be creepy. That would be you remember the one where he was like sitting by the fireplace with his shirt off. Yeah. That would do you remember the game that they made called Sneak King? I think so and they gave it I think they gave it away at Burger King and it was like you snuck around the neighborhood and like gay people Whoppers or something like that that's played. It was like a demo or something like you're like you're like doing like the classic cartoon sneaking like like throughout most of the game.  That one is weird. Remember the lips for Dairy Queen. It was like just a floating. Yeah, that would be weird because you just devour everything that's like a black hole but there's some of them that it's like not as creepy like the wind. He's girl I would be it's like not has she's just like frolicking around like hanging out. Yeah. I don't know. It's I mean and there's also what's the the Philadelphia Flyers mascot gritty yeah gritty would be the ultimate terrifying just  Like Bob like googly eyes follow them everywhere. They look like a bird. He's like that's like a mutated Muppet. If you've never looked at that gritty just look up gritty NHL and it'll be the first mascot that pops up and picture that in like giant form just running down your street you'd be terrified, but you know, I don't know a lot about sports, but I can identify the tear the gritty blocks to gritty is. Yeah pretty pretty is gritty but I think just about I thought about it there.  Many mascots over the years that would just be terrifying. Oh, yeah, absolutely terrifying. Yeah. Well then there's like the whole like 90s was like a mascot craze. Do you remember the California Raisins like the little like jazz band of reflect radio? Yeah, and they had the raisins and they had the little toys you yeah that were like little little tiny raise up. The other things are weird. McDonald's had the like McNuggets that were like little like talking nuggets to remember that. Yeah. That was something too.  Going down memory lane right now. Yeah, just thinking about the 90s like the like the tropics rabbit was like like all the cereal people were creepy. They Lucky Charms guy that guy he's still creepy still weird. I remember because you know when you have nephews or whatever you to children's TV gets put on and so you have the commercials for cereal which I haven't watch the commercials for cereal until I started watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse or he Mouse Clubhouse. Yeah or whatever which is in itself a terrifying show.  Let me tell you let me tell you how terrifying the Mickey Mouse show is right now. Have you seen the Mickey Mouse show right now? So the Mickey Mouse show has toodles in it toodles is an AI manufactured by a Mickey Mouse to run his entire house while he's there and he has to get these tools or go search for the things to find the problem. He is essentially creating this gigantic AI artificial intelligence Skynet character in his house and to run all this.  Stuff not including when they go to Mars and they meet their doppelgangers that talk in a funny language and are different colored from them. That's yeah. Is this the show that they have like the hot dog hot dog hot diggity dog? Oh my God. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's the Mickey Mouse. Yeah Past come inside. It's fun inside. I just unlocked a portion of my brain of memories that I did not know we're surprised you Mouse always goes says every time.  You are working on that one. Let me tell you something really good. I'm a practice. I wasn't Brothers good theater is where I belong Austin, how shouldn't Stella potion seller sell me your potion. So glad you showed your potions are not strong enough. I am should look that up. Go look up potion seller on YouTube that's quite a deep cut into all this. So I think I think we've gone far enough away to come back to it. Who do you think would win in a fight the Stay Puft marshmallow?  Man or Slimer. Well, I think we need to clarify is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man like a normal size or is he giant? He's giant. Okay Giles. They puff Mama Kiba real with you man. Now things slimers got a shot. Here's the thing now. Here's now listen to me.  Simon has an insatiable hunger. Okay, does everything's going to eat the Stay Puft Marshmallow the safe of marshmallow man, you know what he's made of marshmallow we go. I'm assuming are some I mean, I mean, I'm assuming I haven't looked into the anatomy of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but I would assume that he is just a bunch of giant marshmallows. It's just made me think about when he's like on fire when they're like shooting at him. Yes his face like goes from like smiling to like cool. It's like eyebrows go down what a terrifying thing to see some but I still don't hear there's a there's a  Let's think it would thing about this. I've thought about this a lot today and it's like an immovable. What is it an unrelenting Force meets an immovable object still think the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man wins and for like if wears a seven-game series, he's one and he's got he's winning in for but I think I mean he may have like initial winnings. But I mean, I just don't slimers got an insatiable hunger house. It's like imagine that there's this like tick that's like slowly and quickly eating off like pieces of your body. Yes. It's like, how do you kill?  Um, that's already bad this true. But at the same time  Stephen Marshall and that's a big boy. That's a big boy. That's a big boy. I think he can handle himself as the kids say absolute unit. Athlete unit is chunky chunky. Yeah. I don't know. I like these chunky when I discuss salamander fingers and also my dogs, but let's say that lets say that he eats he's like all but you know many grabs him he eats him and then I guess to what you're saying Slimer can just Slimer can just like but it's all depending on Stay Puft Anatomy. So that's the question I have for a listeners is who do you think would win in a fight?  Would it be Stay Puft Marshmallow Man or Slimer in it? And we're going to need your reason when we started this podcast.  I never would have imagined we would one day on an episode have this conversation who would win in a fight the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man or slimy tell you as Lindsay Lohan once said the limit does not exist a limit does not exist to what we will do on this podcast. So there's that. So in our next segment, we have a message from our listener that wants us to check out something. I'm going to hand this over to you. Okay?  Do you think you have low T me too? Well, that's why our friends at Roman have partnered with us.  All right. Is it Pyramid Lake? Yeah, and it's just so should I not read the comment you should read? Okay, because it's from him and then would be like we went in and investigated. This is what we found in its front and back. So everything on the back cool you got all right, so  Today's field correspondence. What are we is that what we're calling? It will just say Okay. So today's story comes from is it Hero Zero Zero scrap that is that the guys is that what the guys name? Okay.  All right. So we got a question from username hero z05 and it goes have you all heard about the water babies in Pyramid Lake. It's an urban legend of sorts Pyramid Lake in Nevada. I'm sure you could find some info all over the internet. I live very close. It's always just been a thing that the natives used to drown their unwanted babies in that Lake and if you disrespect it or something like that, they will  Get you that sounds terrifying also want to notice I said Nevada. Look at you using your you're like right there culturally with it all my friends from Nevada. I used to call it Nevada. I've been absolutely just I've been in trouble with a lot of them. They like got on me for years and I used to do it as a joke. So if you say Nevada don't say Nevada because you're stupid and you're wrong, it's Nevada. Now we know and now, you know wasn't that a thing to back in the day was like a now, you know, because it's Mike.  Super short show remember that on Disney Channel, I do not I do not have Disney Channel. Well, sorry, I broke boy. Yeah, I'd Nickelodeon how to watch SpongeBob like the rest of them. Okay, so  You you you typed this out I did is it wrong? No. No, it's very it's impressive information that I'm going to read here. Okay. I appreciate you letting me read it. I feel like I'm part of the show when I do stuff like this. I'm happy today. I'm happy to do it because typically like you lock me under the stairs and then I only let you out to record this podcast. And then this is the only day like we're running out of daylight. This is the last of the daylight that I'll have probably for another week. So because it's back to the basement.  Aunt all right. So the Americas are home to some pretty epic urban legends abandoned ghost towns haunted Southern cities and the like but the tales that surround a vadas Pyramid Lake is one that especially if you live anywhere near the area just might keep you up at night some believe that the stories that involve Pyramid Lake in the great state of Nevada are just silly fables told to children to keep them away from the water still the Allure of this Scenic Place is strong and it gets its name from the unusual appear men like  Rocks that jut out from the cool and tempting Waters these Waters reach impressive depths of over 350 feet, but the Eerie legends that surround the beautiful Lake have more to do with What Lies Beneath every year a number of bizarre and unexplainable events occur, especially during Springtime and include hearing the cries of the Lost water babies in a countless number of fishermen that set out on these Waters never to return home.  There are a number of tails that try to give a reason to the phenomenon of The Hunt of The Haunting sounds in the missing people to Legends in particular are most commonly told by the locals one of which is referred to as the legend of the water babies and begins with the American Native American Paiute Tribe by tribe who were said to have thrown malformed a premature babies into the dark and murky Waters to drown in an effort to keep the tribe strong keeping only the children who would grow to be capable and and use  Members of their tribe and so the story goes that the shrieks and the cries that are heard late into the night or the ghosts of the drowned babies of the tribe. Another rendition of this haunting Fable involves a Paiute tribesmen and a mermaid from Pyramid Lake who fell madly in love only to have the union rejected from the tribe. The heartbroken mermaid was exiled from the lake by the Paiute Tribe, but only did but not only did she not leave she remained there and growing Fury cursing the waters and seeking Vengeance on any man.  An that attempted to enter her Lake this of course would explain all of the missing fisherman some believe that this version of the story was concocted by the Paiute Tribe themselves in an effort to repair their name and cover up the Savage and Despicable actions of drowning their own babies still who can really be sure if these urban legends hold any validity like all stories of this nature. The only real proof is to experience the place for yourself Perhaps. It is a made-up tail to keep the town's children safe or close to home or possibly the late-night.  Drowned in fence and the missing fishermen are real dangers. That should be taken. Seriously. That being said I think both of us.  Don't want to test this year. No, I don't want to test story whatsoever. I'm terrified of lakes. I don't know if I ever told you that's it. Just like the mystery of what's in there. You can't see anything. Yeah, they're really deep like very deep. I guarantee you so many lakes across the country and across the world. There are so many dead bodies at the bottom of those Lakes. I had a dream about a lake recently. So I was so this is like one of those like weird like a had a weird substitute teacher be like I was on love  But we'll Farah Fawcett last night in my dream. This is similar. I was on a cruise ship going to Portland Oregon to stated Resort. That would fly south to Disneyworld facts aren't important what the fact is very hot the way right. So on the cruise ship was me and the four main characters of the cast of Letterkenny. Okay, and there was a point where we are on this gigantic river that runs across the United States. Yeah long ways. Yes, and as it as it doesn't knows about it now, weíll talk about a wave came because you know,  Yeah on the river, you know, there's plenty of plenty of waves tons and it rocked the boat so much that I like went down it like the bow down and then shot back up real quick and I was standing out on in the front of the front of the area and it shot me off into the air like I was like it was like spring. Yes, and then I fell into the lake and for the amount of like distance that I went to their I fell down to the lake so I was like deep in the lake and I had to like Swip like swim myself out of it. Yeah.  I wasn't going to make it. I thought that I was gonna die in this dream. Yeah, but one of the cast members from Letterkenny had a lifeguarding license great for they jumped in and we like met halfway. And yeah, I pulled you up. That's my like store. So Lakes just there's a lake outside of Atlanta and I can't remember the name of it. For some reason. It's very popular like  Why can I not think of the name of the lake but there have been in the last few years several hundred deaths at this Lake and they built this Lake on over top of this old town and there were like cemeteries and graveyards. Are there always Lakes built over these? Yeah, just like here with god with yeah, Summersville Lake. All right blue stone or boost on that other stuff there too. Yeah, so they built this Lake but they didn't move the cemetery the grave any of the graves anything they just put the lake on it.  And so a lot of people think that it's cursed like it's haunted you're disrespecting these people people go missing on the leg all the time. There are divers that say they'll never dive in that Lake again that they've just seen some stuff. I just don't like  I love swimming but I hate getting a lake because you feel something touch your foot and it's like what is that? What is that? You can't even see your hand just under the water. I don't know. I don't like the thought of there's stuff hundreds of feet below me. Hmm. I don't like that. Not a fan of that especially to bunch of ghost. Children. Yeah, the ghost people protecting the ghost children. Yeah. It's just terrifying. I don't like getting in Lakes. I  One sitting on the boat and a lake. I don't get in the water the things I have a life vest. I'm cool. I don't even get I used we used to go to being in lakes and all sorts of stuff. I refuse to now I just I won't get in the water. I don't want to I don't want it. It's creeping me out thinking about anything submerged in water freaks me out. That's why I'm so scared of like sharks and stuff pictures of like you can barely see a shark coming up out of water literally gives me chills like the heebie-jeebies. I can't do it. So to think that there  or like dead babies come back to life and a lake and Nevada with a mermaid that could pull you under and murder you I'm not like I wasn't going to get in the water as it is, but I'm definitely have ever going to go particularly swimming in Pyramid Lake that doesn't seem like something that I that I want to to Really ever experienced. I don't even want to go fishing with it. I'm you know, I fisherman goal is I'm not doing that either. I'm good at Meijer it from the internet. I'm going to look at pictures of it. It's Serene. Wow, beautiful Lake. Wow. I'm not getting in it. I'm  Use I'm not getting in that label happening. So yeah, but that's interesting. It's terrifying. I just don't you know, I would rather get in the pool. Just give me a pool just give you a nice for what about like Bahamas like a nice like the ocean and about I've swam in the Bahamas really good time. I we were on this island and they had this like net out. Oh, yeah where they like catch all the critters and so like nothing can come into the like well, yeah, it's like protected.  Yeah stuff can still come in so well, like they had the boats, you know, and they kept telling us, you know, like sharks can't get and so you're good to swim. Whatever. Yeah, so I like swim all the way out to this net. I'm like, I'm gonna swim out there and it's one back and I get out. It's not a net at all. Not a net. Nothing there just like a floating kind of line the show The Boat come into much further.  I've never swam so far so fast in my life, but I had to draw like Phelps there for my the Jaws theme song and the back of my head the whole time like Ryan Lochte rolled through hot dude. I probably broke some speed records. Like I was flying I was like 15, it's funny I was flying but it was nice because again if I stopped and I like I could see my feet I could see everything around me. That doesn't if I can see it coming. How about what about a ghost, baby?  If you if you get okay, so here's the scenario if you're in a completely clear water and you can see ghosts baby coming. Yeah, I'm fine. You're good. I could beat the crap out of that goes baby. How strong let's sing about it. Okay, how strong can a ghost baby really big? What if they're biters one little Boop to the nose like think about it. I'm saving myself at least like 15 seconds by that point. I'm hitting like Michael Phelps beads out of that water that goes they've probably been ghost bait pride of not a walk because an idiot, so I'm just going to run.  Boom, I'm fine. I don't give a I don't give out care about the ghost baby. It was a mermaid. I probably care a little bit because she's got the advantage because you can swim you got that thin and flipper. Yeah, so but goes baby. I don't care about good now. It's like ghost takes you back to the argument. Like how many third graders you think you could fight all at one time? Yeah. Okay. That's a classic argument. Yeah. I think I could take at least like 27 third graders if I run full speed.  If I if they're let's say there's like twenty seven third graders. They're like we're gonna kill you you had to fight to the death. They have weapons now just hand to hand combat my specialty. Okay, there's 27 of them. I'm getting a running start and I'm just going Barrel just like boo boo hoo. Boom. I'll be like fullback. I'm just gonna low man wins low man always wins I'ma Get Low hit him. Boom. Boom boom bouncing off of them. Mmm 27  Ghost baby. I mean it's gonna be a tough 27. It's not like I'm not I'm not saying that I'm a hundred percent going to live. Huh? But if someone's like you had like, you know, the more you do the more points, whatever. So once they're knocked over they're done. They're out. No, I would say just like incapacitated. I'm not gonna say fight to the death because that's a little harsh. That's a little that's that's the ghost babies. I'll fight to the death. Well, I mean technically they're going to fight you to the death because they're already framed.  Guess what if I get out of that water as little idiots can't catch me get me my hit some I'm gonna hit somebody with me saying speed but the third graders if I just have to like incapacitate like they just got to be, you know down for the count. I could take 27 to maybe like 30 30 is probably the top. I mean, that's a lot of women. Yeah, and it depends on their strategy third graders are kind of stupid. So like I don't know if they're going to have like a good strategy to  Sorry, if we have any third grade listeners, you'll you'll develop strategic skills eventually skills to taking down that yeah larger mammals.

Class is in session. You're listening to squat University by dr. Aaron horse Shake. Now. Let's start the show coordinate ranks in his manic depression settled in flipping in the fantasy podcast listeners. Thank you so much for checking out Today Show. This is episode 45 of the squad University podcast the go with each and every one of these shows is bringing as much Value Pat content to help you move better in the gym and in life decrease your body's aches and pains and I'll be richer true athletic potential now today's podcast is First of its kind for squat University as we're going to have a Roundtable discussion with some people you should definitely know about. So before we jump into the content of today, I'll let each one of them introduce themselves for you guys might want to start this off. You're awesome. Well, I mean heck before we introduce ourselves. I think all of us here to myself Mike and Dan Pope and kefir Lambie. We're just super thankful to be on the show. So thank you. You're mean you're doing an amazing job. I mean Not only was that introduction like DJ quality right now.  Like fantastic free. She ate it dude, even like your social media content and stuff. I mean what you clearly put a lot of work into it and you're very impactful. You know, what you're doing you're educating people and not everybody's educating people. A lot of people are just like trying to sound like they're experts. What are your just educating people and of course people will figure out that you're an expert by doing that but you're doing it. So right that you know, when we started chatting about coming on we were, you know, super proud to be able to join you here because we support everything you're doing we love your social media, so  I really appreciate that's an honor to hear from you guys. Yeah. Well, so I'm like Ronald, you know, one of the the co-owners of champion PT and performance up in Boston Dan and kefir here both, you know physical therapist and strength coach with us here at champion and essentially will you know, we have a you know, we have a kind of a multidisciplinary disciplinary. Sorry. It's early for me. I kind of approach that we put together here where we combine like performance-based physical therapy in personal training and sports performance type stuff.  At Champion, it's really just based on my past experience like working in Pro Sports and working with athletes and just seeing how well they do by using this approach by kind of working together as a team instead of in silos with all the different things that we just wanted to do that a champion here. So, you know, and I think it speaks volumes right because you got myself you have Dan a physical therapist, but also, you know has coaching experience as well. Kiefer's a coach but also has athletic experience and all these other things, you know, I mean you put it together, I think even just like us together today.  It shows you a lot of what Champions about how we collaborate for sure and I love that. I don't I don't know if I can follow that that was my name is Dan Pope. I run Fitness being free.com. So I guess I'm in a similar boat as yourself. My biggest passion is Fitness, you know, it started off as a strength coach done a bunch of sports. I was big into CrossFit and a while and strongman for a while. And yeah, I probably see about how about 75% of my patient population every day.  R trying to get back to Fitness some sort of Fitness related thing. So that's really my my big thing with physical therapist and I'm trying to get you back to the training full force. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, Mike did his thing where he says everything for us and then they keep telling me I'm the director of Fitness here. I've been here about three years. My original background was playing college basketball and then I went on and in turn to Cressy performance. I worked a lot with baseball players and that's where Mike and I fell in love with each other and kind of  I ended up here but along the way I got into power lifting I got into weightlifting. So I'm kind of a mud of all those things and that's what's cool about Champions. I get an opportunity to work with all those different populations Under One Roof. So very cool. Well, I'm super pumped to pick your guy's brains today because today's topic is all about overhead lifting. So obviously, it's quite University. I've talked to ton about the squad. We talked about everything lower body for the past couple weeks on a podcast. But today I want to talk about overhead lifting.  Ting specifically assessments for technique when we're talking about any athlete that's doing you know snatches clean and jerks presses anything like that. So let's start our discussion today with how we screen in evaluate the upper body to find the cause behind problematic lifting technique in the development of ventral injuries, Dan. I'll let you start with this one. What do you take into account? The tests & Measures that you find extremely helpful that others should be using in their own assessments of athletes.  Yeah, I guess the big thing that the think about is why do people get hurt with overhead lists, you know, I think the one of the biggest reasons is just like poor application of programming principles and not really Preparing People for pressing in general, you know. Yeah when the thing that floats around out there is I go. Okay. We need to have full range of motion overhead to press overhead right which I'll agree with. I think that's important, but I don't think that people are getting injured left and right just because they don't have  have passed overhead Mobility. I think a lot of times they're just suffering from overuse injuries. The program is not great for them and they try to do too much and I think that's the reason why we see so many shoulder problems. So I would say the overhead Mobility is going to be really important. But the other thing is just I think programming is probably the number one thing that we need to get better at preventing shoulder injuries. Yeah, I think Mobility can definitely one of those Buzz terms that gets thrown around a lot and everyone loves to see the cool new Mobility exercise thrown out there, but they don't all  Think about stability exercises or just the way in which their programming that can have a dramatic impact on the forces placed on their body Mike. What do you have to say on this topic? I know I remember watching one of your videos where you were screening and showing the difference in how to sort of weed out sort of a ladder Terry stiffness where we're at, you know putting the person into an internally for sexually rotated position. That was definitely an eye-opener for me and my own assessments of athletes just how you can so easily screen out whether or not we're having some  Shooting stiffness in the last two possibly an overhead issue anything else you think are are huge factors that most people should be including in their assessments that the not already maybe yeah. Sure. I mean all the overhead pressing movement is kind of kind of like a goofy movement. If you really think about it, like, you know, the bench pressing like more horizontal pressing like squatting deadlifting all those types of things are kind of like more normal movement patterns for the body, but we don't really work in the overhead position position very well, right even if like you're in the overhead position a lot like during  Functional activities you tend to you know, move your body around so you're not in complete overhead motion. So it's a really goofy position for the for the shoulder right? It's at like and range it's almost at structural and range to so, yeah, I mean like I think damn nailed it right? I mean we often try to say like there's like, well, you know, you don't have enough Mobility or you don't have enough overhead stability for example, but oftentimes, there's a lot of people that can still do it with those limitations. It's just that they're doing it too much or you know are you know programming wise they haven't built  It up the capacity or something like that. So I would say like just take a big step back with your screening process and think what are the positions that need to be Chief? What do you need to get with? You know glenohumeral? What do you need to get with scapulothoracic? What do you need to get with even just the Rasik extension those types of things break those down Mobility wise, right, but then understand that, you know, you don't have to necessarily be perfect. As long as you're not overloading program. So two things, right we kind of work on like minimizing the compensations, but then often the whole other end of the  Factor was just maximizing the capacity of it. And if you're just slamming it and jumping into like an aggressive water something like that that has a lot of those there and you're not ready for it. I think that's again like kind of you know, piggybacking with Dan's that that's kind of that's it more than anything else. So, you know, yes Mobility overhead stability but programming as well. So, you know, Kieffer, you know, I mean when key for looks at a guy, I mean Dan and I are going to look at mobility and kieffer's going to probably talked a little bit about like, all right. What's your what's your path programming right so seek?  See if he needs to tweak it. Yeah keep her. Do you have anything that you can add into this conversation? Yeah, I would say, you know piggybacking off of what they talked about from a programming perspective the two big things that we see that are missing one is like a good balance of the types of movements they're doing you know, so especially in CrossFit and weightlifting. We get a lot of overhead movement both pushing and pulling but not a ton of horizontal stuff and then in terms of you know warm ups, we've come a long way from, you know, just doing a bar complex to warm up to now people are you know, they're like using bands they're trying to  Up the shoulders before stuff but there's a big difference between doing scapular and rotator cuff exercises as a warm-up and actually progressively overloading them to try and make those structures stronger so that they can tolerate the amount of training that they're doing. So that's the difference between like, you know, doing band exercises and doing dumbbell exercises where you trying to go up a pound or two each week and it's the boring basic stuff, but it makes up a big piece of the accessory work that we do so that people can train with more volume over time definitely so talking on those specific warm-ups like you  Talked about you talked about using barbells. You taught her dumbbells, you talked about using bands. Are there any specific I guess we'll calm corrective exercises. But basically for Preparation exercises you think over at athletes should be using and including in their training program specifically maybe during that warmup period or just after their training that they can use to sort of maintain their shoulder health and decrease the risk of injury. Obviously. Everyone's can be a little bit different based on their individual history their individual weak links, but are there any specific General exercise?  That you've seen recently that you've been a huge proponent of you know, for example, I saw kefir on your Instagram you had a video of the Turkish kettlebell get up. I think that's like one of my favorite exercises that across the board. Most people I think should be programming in every once in awhile because of how different it, you know, the positions that it's putting your shoulder and how you have to maximize your stability and mobility in a bunch of different positions of that body. Sure. I'll jump in and just kind of like speak kind of like globally like philosophically first and  and yeah freaking for maybe talk some specifics but kind of the system we follow here at Champion is like when we identify that there's a movement pattern that were that maybe isn't the best or we're not getting the quality out of it it to perform as well as we can't we do is we essentially do three things. Right? The first thing you have to dress is mobility, right because you don't have Mobility nothing else is going to work. So that's that's kind of like number one. So we address Mobility with our corrective exercises are manual therapy ourself mobilization drills those types of things.  You then we work on control, right and then three finally we work on load. But if you kind of skip those orders Mobility control load then you know, I think sometimes you run into some trouble right? It's funny like the world likes to argue like you need like, you know, strength versus stability and they like to like say like stability as you know is not going to help you get strong. But if you're stable, you will have a better ability to load down the road by answers. I agree. It's funny like everybody wants to argue should you do you know the example a  It's always funny is like squatting on like a bosu ball. Like everybody says that right and yes, you're not going to get strong squatting on a bosu ball. But if you work on your stability during the squat, you will have some carryover to be able to generate more torque when you get into the non unstable or the stable position. I don't know what the non unstable position means better, right? So that's our philosophy. And then I guess I'll let you guys kind of take it from here in terms of specifics. Maybe we kind of hit that question from all angles. Yeah. Well that whole thing. Also you talked about like the whole  Squatting on a stability ball and people argue about that but it's also like why can't I do both I have someone coming in to me that's you know, 12 weeks post-op based the other pair. Why can't I have them do a couple balances squatting with holds on a bosu ball? And then also go do the barbell training afterwards, you know, I don't see why it always has to be one or the other. Why can't we have both in a good comprehensive training program, I think about like in sports who we do a lot of things like, you know, like, you know a heavy bat in the on Deck Circle and baseball.  Or something it right. There's always like things we do so that way then when you go back to the activity, it seems a little easier right? I mean if you squat an unstable surface and then make it stable and put a barbell on your back. You're going to feel way better in that position right for sure. I think students and young people like in this field. I think they get caught up because research studies to compare the two, right? Yeah the research that you have to compare the two right? It has to be a versus B. So then everybody in their mind thinks well, I need to pick a versus B when realize it when  Here in the real world. It's about doing them together. Why pick just one? Yeah, I think that's why some of the new people get so confused as they see all these research projects kind of comparing the two and saying which one's better but they're missing the that you could just do both. Yeah makes total sense. Awesome. I might try to piggyback off of the bike. That's a piece that you're going on today. I'm trying to steal everything from kefir very very similar question. I guess. I was just released a program.  And one of the big things is where try to teach shoulders hurting but in terms of extra exercises to keep people safe from the gym and perform better. I think it depends on two things. So specificity of the individual right and then specificity for the sport. So we use something like Olympic weightlifting as an example. So a lot of people have trouble with overhead Mobility. So maybe part of that warm up is going to be extra Mobility work to get into those positions and after that maybe you're doing some extra waiters walks wherever it is try to reinforce that new range of  Ocean you may do that at the end of your session as well. He's I think we need to think about more as a profession. Is that when people do get hurt? Where is this happening? Right so for something like Olympic weightlifting there's a ton of overhead work. There's ton of stability and range right you throw that barbell overhand catch it. So exercise is like windmills like Turkish got UPS waiters walks are great because you're building stability in those positions. And then if you think about something like power lifting where people are getting strain injuries super Pacs PEC minor to an obvious,  AC joint problems you can incorporate things like pet flies and extra pressing exercises just to prepare those joints for the forces that you're going to be thrown out. Definitely definitely. No, that's good. I think what I was going to say is like it's kind of big making a full of Mike said is none of these things work that well in isolation, right? So rather than think of it as like, oh like, you know, either you overhead press or we do all these boring, you know, cuff exercises and scapular stability things. It's we think of it as like, how do we stack all of these things together?  So if you want to overhead, press if you want a jerk if you want to snatch then we say all right. Well, we should probably do some unilateral overhead pressing to build a little bit of strength and stability and that way we should probably do some stuff like Turkish got ups and Carries and crawls and build a little bit more stability. We should probably do some horizontal pulling to kind of balance out movements and then we should probably add in like the traditional, you know, PT like exercises like side the lying external rotations and all those type tools. Why are those PT exercises? What is that? You made them famous?  Let's call him isolated exercises, which is totally fine. It's not make people feel like your engine and your diary not keep her. Sorry. I'm just sorry. Wow, people might know better from PT, but we use a lot in training. It's boom. Oh good rephrase. So rather than you know, this either or effect is more of like, alright, let's see where you're at in your training whether you're coming off an injury or you're in a preparatory phase or in a more specific phase. Now. We just scale how much of each of those things you're doing versus having to pick and choose what you're doing so that way we can always  Like a strong robust position for people definitely. I like really what you said Dan when you're talking about we need to get that Mobility first because if we don't know the mobility we can't get into that position, but then let's also supplement some type of stability exercise on top of that to sort of lock it in. I know you talked about the windmill exercise. I've been playing around with those recently and just as obviously we're doing almost like a Turkish kettlebell get up from the top down. I've felt that it's been very very helpful in my own training recently.  All right. So next question. Obviously, we live in a very big social media world where there is a ton of information at the click of a button and it's a positive because I think it gives us a lot of times the opportunity to speak to others and educate others and there's a lot of good information out there on the flip side. There's also a lot of very poor information out there that it's tough for people who don't have a background in the world that we do to really differentiate between the two so  Question is when it comes to the information that you see out there what modes of training or different things have you seen where you see people sort of missing the bar now, for example during the snatch lift, obviously when we're pulling we need a lot of internal rotation, especially to keep the bar close to the body. I see a lot of people still that are jamming the sleeper stretch down people's throat as a way to improve internal rotation and Mike. I know this one is all specifically let you take this away, but what other things  Do you guys see I'll let you guys think on that before we get to you. They see people sort of missing the bar as far as what they're doing and learning from social media. So I think the biggest issue is social media right now is that especially Instagram, right? If you like look at like the population people on Instagram. It's a younger crowd, right and there's a lot of stuff out there. So what we're seeing is a lot of younger less experienced people, but obviously bright people motivated people doing a great job of stuff but lest experience and what they're doing.  That well. All right. What what Mobility drills are out there for certain things and then they're just like throwing it out there and what they what they don't realize is that if they actually had some years of experience doing that that it not only sometimes doesn't work. But sometimes it makes people worse. And so I think what we're seeing is we're seeing a ton of information disseminated over social media, especially Instagram by people with less experience and that's not necessarily bad, but I people are going to Instagram for like their main source of Education right now.  And that's the you know the real challenging part. So it's not that like there's like good or bad out there. It's just there's lots of things we see and we shake our heads and we said like ah, man in five years. They're going to regret that post because they're getting that they know like yes, that makes sense. That's where you learned in school or that wasn't what your textbook said, or you know, you saw somebody else Quoc that but if you actually tried to do that in dozens of people over the next few years, you're going to realize that some things don't always work the way they're supposed to work, right? So I think that's the biggest thing we're seeing.  There are two you know terms of specific stretches like like you brought up the sleeper stretch. For example, I think a lot of people don't understand why they lose Mobility. Right? So II just torque them self saying well, I've lost X. So I'm gonna do a Mobility drill that just torques the crap out of Acts. It seems very backwards, right? If you lost your Mobility, I think just forcing it into more Mobility. That doesn't make a lot of sense right like no. This is very few muscles like that get like flexibility issues. Like, you know hamstrings are good example, you know your hamstrings get tight and you know,  Oh, like kind of like, you know different muscular type things but most of the time we're seeing people torque joints. Yeah. I'm not rich muscles if you're torquing joints. Usually what happens with the body is going to take the path of least resistance. And then what you're going to do is you're going to probably hypermobile eyes things that don't need to and you're going to completely miss the boat on the thing that's actually tight and most times it's structural or its alignment or it's an imbalance. It's like something else right and we're just trying to thwart The Joint so sleeper trip stretch is a great example. It's usually a combination of the anatomical  Things that of why you don't have internal rotation, you're probably not supposed to have internal rotation for whatever reason. So if you working and what's going to happen is something bad's going to happen, right? You're gonna you know, you know start tearing your posterior cows or you can start jamming your join you going to start in flaming your cough whatever it maybe because you didn't really address the underlying issue and that's kind of that's kind of how we're seeing things right now. It's like everybody is quick to rush on Instagram specifically and kind of throw out these drills and everybody's trying to apply them to  to everything and it's you know, I kind of call it the corrective exercise bell curve a kind of always said that like 20% of the time you might get lucky, you know, the majority of the time you're probably just wasting your time but 20% of the time to you're also going to screw yourself up and make it worse right? You need a good assessment need somebody to actually work with you. So I don't know if I left any room for piggybacking so good piggyback, but sorry, okay. Now I'm be guilty of this. I still am right so the stuff that's going  To be best if people really need to hear about that we're doing on a daily basis is not the stuff that's also going to grow us and popularity from a social media perspective it tell you how many silly exercise I've seen out there that people absolutely love if you throw something out there really weird people. God gasps call great idea of really cool. I'm like I use this exercise like twice Keepers like there's exercise of my cast sometimes I don't know but that's a problem right because what's going to happen is that people are going to really popular just do a whole bunch of weird stuff and then  For one they might not even do any that stuff, right? Yeah. It's to it's not even what's most effective so that's a big problem. And then also in you know, I we can discuss that a little more too but I think very similarly about the sleeper stretch and I made Burns to purchase a penis, but I'm not a big fan of fit internal rotation drills the same exact reason. Yeah, I think a lot of times reason why we're lacking internal rotation, especially in deep hip flexion is probably because we have a bony block right and I know that people are going to come at me and say like well,  Maybe we can adapt to that position over the course of time and get stronger and we're not going to necessarily break things down. But I believe kind of what Mike said so you're going to have a couple people there who do better you can have helped people to have no change. You have a couple people are they get hip impingement and end up hurting them. So I think that we're doing the same thing at the hip as what we're doing at the shoulder that that might be the number one thing I'm concerned about about Instagram is people with tight hips all eyes. All I see all these videos of Let's just put it a 10 range and then jam it in.  Into internal and external rotation. That doesn't make a lot of sense, right? Yeah, exactly. Not really building capacity and range don't even know what that concept means. Like you're just you're literally taking a joint you're approximating it right and then grinding yeah that seems like a bad idea the people that are good at those are hypermobile people and they aren't engaging on that. But every person that thinks they need Mobility. That's probably bad for them. Right? It's only probably acceptable in people with hypermobility and you know, there's no there's no such thing as  Never I get that but I'm just saying like in the general terms, you know, that's probably one of the things we're seeing the most right now is the hip starting to get you know, Jam more than ever for some reason and yeah, we'll see in 10 years and everybody's you know, we'll see we'll see what happens there. Everybody's gipsz hip some I'm concerned. Literally. I think that's a big reason to why when were if we're talking about the hips why it's such a good idea to not have everyone sort of squat the same way, you know, some people are like, alright everyone needs to squat with their toes.  Relatively straightforward well for 60% of people that may work. But anyone who's God, you know from world retroversion, you know or anything like that acetabular retroversion. They're probably going to be having more of a towed out angle and that's going to be normal for their body. But if you read a book or an article or see something online, that's like know everyone needs to be straight forward. Then you're pushing that person into a more internally rotated position into a bony block that their body is not ready for you're going to have problems down the road. Absolutely. So you nailed it and I think as a profession where you getting better at that  We're yeah, we're saying we should squat differently now, but we're all still mobilizing the same. Yeah, so hopefully in the next few years that starts to become a little bit more individualized as well. But you know, if you should change your positioning to squat because of anatomical things then you should probably also be changing your Mobility drills totally makes sense. Okay for what you have to say on this. I think the yeah, I just think it's kind of like what Dan was saying right look like it's really hard to get people to buy into doing the basics, right? So to say to someone like a  Take care of your soft tissue work do the right Mobility drills for you and do some of these, you know basic exercises that I already got in trouble for calling PT base exercises by Mike, right? Like that's cool and sexy for people and I'll being kind of like in the middle on any topic versus being really polarizing you on it isn't going to get a lot of attention. So I think that's our social media is like, you know, you want to have an impact but when you say something that's you know, very basic or common knowledge that people don't think is going to have a lasting impact and nobody listens, but if you say something  You're out there, you get all the attention from it. And then you feed off that you want to do more and more of that. So you're constantly searching for like, you know, what's the new crazy position I can mobilize in or what's the new crazy way that I can stabilize my shoulder versus doing the things that we know work. Well when combined with smart programming and Progressive training and I think you could break out the last five minutes as its own podcast episode because that is so in that all of us together putting that together there. That's we really really in my mind like nailed why  Why you can't be using social media as your main source for Education? Yeah, I mean, especially, you know, if you think about what each of us said here that's and that's what people are doing. Right? So, you know, that's that's super important. I hope your your listeners get it now get me wrong. It's a good you can't be your main source. We also have to actually do some incredible things that you know, maybe somebody actually provides references to and stuff like that for sure. Alright, so let's take you back off that then for someone who  To learn more about you know and injury going on a technique problem in right now. Their main source is going to Instagram what other modes of Education would you say is right for someone or just a good entry access. Obviously the prime not going to go down to their University Bookstore sometimes and pick up a you know, $300 textbook. Well, what's a good way that they can learn and educate themselves. What would you guys like?  Ultimate shoulder course, I would say people that are more experienced in this field. Yeah, I learned from them. A lot of them have good resources either, you know online products blog post. So, you know, most of the, you know people with good experience like, you know, like look like if you're you know, if you want to learn something about squatting or something like that go to like all these websites or people that have been doing it for ten plus years like the very Crest season like Roberts is it  General quarters, like there's millions of people like that. Right? Well not Millions, but there's a bunch of people like that that you can say like, all right, I'm gonna go learn like, oh Mike Robertson has like this program on on technique or programming, you know, something like that like go learn from people that have that experience learn from the Mike boils. The Cosgrove's I mean all those people like that have been doing this for a long time. That's where you get. Your learning in Instagram is almost like where you like it's like you almost test pilot new ideas and bounce things off. But if I think the thing you should  Seagal for learning is experience learn from people that are experienced working with people because they've seen lots of things work and lots of things not work, right? So that's how I would say, I think that's great. I think you can't really substitute like a good mentorship actually going somewhere and seeing what the people who are already doing what you want to do partly doing right? I think that's huge. The one thing I'll add to that is that I think that as Healthcare Providers are not exactly sure the audience is going to be listening to this but let's say for a physical  That's a lot of times physical therapist is so pigeon-holed into learning more physical therapy or physical therapy More Physical Therapy. One of the things I think is very useful that I've done is I try to get some mentorship from actual coaches or people that are still in the same realm as you kind of we're trying to do Fitness, right but physical therapist. We need to go out there and see what tried-and-true coaches are doing right sort of what are their thoughts. What are the theories? What's their expertise? Let's try to blend some of that with our own knowledge right and learn from  Professions that can help us. Yeah hundred percent agree. Yeah, I would say, you know, my unique slant on it is like is go seek out a coach yourself and ask them questions. You know, I've I right dozens of programs every month and have been for years, but I still pay other coaches to write my own programming with the expectation that I'm going to ask them questions throughout the process. So I will specifically pick people that have expertise in some topic or area that I don't have so that I can learn more about what they're doing because you know, all of these guys are posting stuff on their social media, but you see those things  Isolation versus how they actually uses a part of a bigger program and you get a better appreciation for like where it fits into the rest of the stuff going on that. Yeah. That's a good point going back to our last conversation to their from kieffer's that I even think like some people are making some of these posts that we don't necessarily agree with I don't think they even like that a 60 second snapshot of their mind. Is it out there? It's just not fair. So, you know, I mean, I think even if you talk to a lot of people offline about, you know, some of the things out there even though admit and they'll say  Like oh, yeah, that's just like such a small piece of the puzzle. We all the inexperienced people can't see that they don't know that that's just a small piece of the puzzle and they have no and again like that's why I like if you look at your Instagram post, for example, like they're you know, they're quite detailed. And so if you don't you don't look at your post and feel like you know, it's just like a quick spot snapshot. It's like it's quite a bit of detail. If you put together all your posts together. It's quite educational, right? So it's all about how you try to do it. Right? It's all about how you try to give information. I think.  Could help for sure. Yeah, I think it's really tough. But I think it's an important thing for other people when they're putting stuff on Instagram to really try to put the why behind whatever they're trying to educate people on just because like what you're trying to educate person a on might not write be might not be right for person be you know, and it but if you're only talking about it very very general the people that are educating themselves. They don't know the difference right and online. It's person b c d e f g h i j k is that there's so many people all that stuff.  But I think that's you gotta at least, you know acknowledge that just say okay. This is appropriate for a small percentage of people but it's probably for you. You're going to love it. Exactly. Yeah, I know for sure like what you guys talked about the brought blogs, you know, Dan I've read some of your stuff that you put out there, you know talking about like, you know, Eric cressey is blog. I've read a ton of his stuff. He's been putting stuff out for years. And then Mike I even took your your shoulder course, I think it was two years ago, which was awesome. So, you know, there's so much information out there available.  For people that is off of Instagram that thing people need to go on search for and blogs are a great spot for it. For sure. I guess next question off of that before we get into our last question today. This is more of a personal question for each one of you guys obviously being a practitioner, but we're also sort of training ourselves. We're doing experiments on ourself as we age and go through the process what are different injuries or can you point to an injury you've had personally that has taught you something.  You know as far as how you should be training that maybe you didn't you had to take a step back and look at yourself differently because obviously we treat patients a specific way. But sometimes when it comes to our own health our own bodies, we're almost not looking at it the exact same way. I'll go first, I guess even though it's not her first time. He's not always piggybacking and a half closing in on two years ago. I had a knee surgery for the second time just a menace ectomy, but you know I jump back.  The jump right back into training. I was super excited. I was training for an Olympic weightlifting me and I started ramping up my volume really fast. And for the first time in my life, I realized that there was kind of like a limit to my recovery ability coming back from that. Yeah realize that I couldn't just manage things by you know, like taking ibuprofen or deciding I was going to change my stance is for the day or wearing these leaves to make things better and that it would and that I actually needed to take into account, you know progressing my workload slowly over time. And so what I've done a lot more with  people now is like, you know, when they have little little injuries or a little dings going on and stuff is looking at like how much we're doing not saying that we necessarily have to change everything but looking at you know, cutting back the volume and coming up with a systematic plan to progressing back to what they want to do and it's had a huge impact on how you know how much the clients buy-in or how excited they are for training because they don't feel like they can't do something anymore. They know that there's just this, you know imbalances far as what their capacity is and what they're doing right now and if we shift those variables that can still be really happy with training for sure.  I got I've got a lot of injuries or a lot of stuff just because I'm Jim the most part but I think the private biggest one for me is probably my hips. Like I've had a lot of these over the course of time. I've had some Fai issues. I never actually got an MRI. So I'm going to label Tara. I don't know. So one of the things is that so two things right for one things take a lot longer to heal and four to  six weeks right now if this will therapist sometimes you're like, oh for six weeks speak to you should be good and then people go there for six weeks are like, oh it still hurts. You know, it didn't work like well that wasn't fair in the slightest bit and I've had some health issues of taking a few years for me to really get a handle on to the point where they don't hurt. I don't have pain when I said, I don't pay my squad, right and the other piece is that I think a lot of times rehab just get super fancy and people kind of go crazy, but the biggest thing that makes changer just very small changes from a  Rain perspective changing this little tree changing that little tweak and giving it time and patience see human beings are such emotional creatures, right? Especially athletes like us like with can't squat. I'd like my whole identity is based around my squad case. Why more Presley Can't can't let the barbell. It sucks. Right? Hmm. The part of it too is just trying to be logical and say okay. Yeah. Well, let's make a little tweak will change this almost see how it goes Trevor few weeks. Okay, how am I feeling is that going well and knows change one thing look more. Just give it time.  Time he the patients and most things get better if you approach it that way, you know, definitely how I approach a lot of my rehab my athletes now. So now I get I guess my contribution I would just add that, you know as as I'm getting older I'm starting to experience how things hurt differently right like life hurts. Now, you know, you know, I mean like so like I worked out yesterday and like I'm really really sore today rightly like you know, so it's it's funny.  Child like you wake up and I'm like, oh my God, I can't even I can't even move like my back today, you know and you it's those little things like that. I think as you get older like I would say you kind of go through the phases right like your the teens twenties. It's like let's just get jacked, right? The 30s is like yeah. Yeah. So keep her still in that phase, right? Yeah. Yeah too long and your third thing in your 30s you trying to transition from let's get jacked. Like let's get like Jack but like let's hurt a little less and then by the end of your 30s, you're like, well this isn't working, you know, like  I can't do both and then once you get into your 40s, you just want to like not die. Right and that's not like my dad. That's what I'm trying to do is extend life. Yeah, so right now so but it's funny that they'll like how you like, you know things you used to do before it just it feels different. It impacts your day differently, right? So and a lot of there's a lot of good smart coaches out there that seen do a good job. But I've also seen the opposite where young coaches program like like middle-aged adult Fitness gen-pop people as if they  We're in their 20s just like them because they haven't yet experienced how painful life gets right but I don't know be so pessimistic, you know, I mean, they haven't felt it themselves yet. They haven't felt what it's like to have your testosterone plummet as you age and what it's like to you know, not sleep because you have you know, young children at that phase like there's all these phases in life that like until you go 3 through them. I don't think you really appreciate them a hundred percent. I think that's that's what I've learned. I've been I've changed the way I train for the  last 10 years like so much and it's always I'm losing. I'm just I keep I'm taking away. I keep going back back back because I'm trying to feel better and better and better so, you know, your priorities change them in the fir serve. Well, I think that point so you definitely have to change your programming to fit your life. There's so many variables. It's not just like, you know, this person has this goal. You also have to take into account. You know, what are they doing from nine to five? What are they doing from five till, you know nine o'clock the next day if they do they have three kids.  You know because that's going to be a different stress than just going and working at you know, X jobs, you have to take that all into account when you're programming and how that's going to impact that person not only performance wise but also the type of injuries that are going to sustain. All right. So 842. I know he said we'll do a quick 45 minute podcast the last question. Obviously, we have a big game coming up this Sunday with the Chiefs first the Patriots. What are your guys thoughts on the game? What are you guys thoughts on your outcomes thoughts. When's this podcast go live?

They're a good team, you know, the the Pats aren't like what they used to be.  Then you see him just destroy San Diego like that and you kind of get excited. I mean they just they crafted a better plan that San Diego. Yeah. Well, of course, they're still amazingly talented, but you look like a, you know, a team like Casey I think it's going to be can we stop there? Keep the Casey offense because I don't think your offense your defense can stop our offense. Yeah. They the defense has not been good this year. It's been pretty bad. So what do you you want to do like a side better something that are you in Kansas City where I am?  I'm in Kansas City.

You guys we missed you last week, but tonight we're back. And we're in the Hamptons with episodes 10 and 11 mama drama and clear the air. I'm your host Angel Sanders with my girl breathe. Hello, who is a Jersey girl herself and Russell race Silva. He will be back with us February. I don't like he says yeah. I don't know how many wins days are left this month. I think one more but Russell, you know, he's working so he'll be  Back with us in February. So let's get right into it. As I said we missed you guys last week, but we have two episodes tonight and tonight's episode was real juicy before we get into all that. What did you think about these last two episodes the last two episodes were really really good. I was I've been pleasantly surprised because they've been kind of dry and I'm always I all right. This is the same old story line, but now things are picking up a little bit. Yeah, so I'm anxious for next week.  First time I'm anxious for the next week's show. I remember one night saying that was such a good episode and you were like really? Yeah. I'm glad like we're both on the same page. Yeah you like these episodes have been pretty good. We saw last week was the Mother's Day episode. And even though Mother's Day is supposed to be all about love. Of course. There was still drama. So would you think about that Drag Brunch? Um, I didn't really I didn't get the point of making it a  A Drag Brunch, yeah, I guess it was it fits Margarets personality. It's really out there in different. Yeah, okay, but I think the brunch was a really nice idea. I love all the way I'll always love having the parents on the episodes. Yeah, a sweeter side of the cast members because you're always seeing them caddy and full of drama. But this time it was really really nice. I always feel from Margaret when she talks about her mom though. Yeah. I know. She said that they haven't had the best.  Ship like I guess more so recently but I think I'm better. Yeah. Yeah, I think Margaret did say something about she got the the idea of the drag from a party a past party that she did. I don't know why she wanted to tie that in with Mother's Day. And that was I don't know. Maybe she just wanted to be different but I do love that. She utilized the space at her own house, which will see people talking about wasting money in the next episode. Right? But, you know, Margaret's not afraid to say hey I'm in  Dead and I want to sell my property some of my property so, you know get out of dead and the fact that why until it sells I'm going to use it and I'll go rent some venue like she has a huge house and I like that, you know, she was like a regular person and used her own space. We also saw Melissa and Joe, you know talking about their family and Joe does not have a lot of reproductive. I learned that conversation with her sons.  Because it's Melissa and Joe. Yeah, but at the same time like your little ones out there that you have no filter. No the little one I forgot which one it was, but he understood completely he's like that you have like 3 and 15 million super young. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I gotta learn one day. I guess that was the day I was kind of taken aback when the doctor said that there are certain supplements that might stop you. First thing. I thought was just lost. Yeah, but then Melissa was quick to  in it up and say, oh I was using discrete. I don't know why she wants his hair to grow on his arm. Somehow is was okay. I know she did say something about him rubbing a cream on his arm because I was going to say that it's like a cream steroid but no because like a lot of I don't know if it's Italian culture or what but even like we're Jersey Shore and the guys on here. They're all super buff in like like weightlifter type. So I was like, oh, so is he using a cream to like get bigger muscles? I don't know. What no, she said it was for the  Hair growth. Oh, yeah. She said her hair growth on all that's why I was like, why does it why does he want here? He's ordering cream and like making his sperm not available because he wants hairy arms. Okay. All right, it's your world. All right, we just watching it every week. But every week we do have amazing people that tune in to our show. Yes, and we want to say thank you so much for being loyal and watching us here at AfterBuzz TV. Thank you so much for making us the ESP.  And of TV talk we wouldn't be able to do any of this stuff without you guys. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you, make sure you like comment and subscribe under this video and also tune in to our other shows we have here. We have other reality TV shows we have scripted dramas. We have romance. We have movie reviews book reviews so much more plethora of entertainment here at activist TV. So also I want to make sure that I shout out some people that were quick to comment under last week's show we'll the week before  We have Divine self. Stephanie McNeil re achoo Holly Burnett what FC Leah Nicole. I'm a lot of people frat fat Phil. So everybody that that I didn't get to also thank you and we're always looking at the comments to make sure you follow us everywhere and I've seen Russell response to some of them before I do you have any favorite ones? Oh gosh. I have a lot of people that Divine self is always always.  Consistent with something to say yeah one comment was I didn't think there was anything funny about Mom Margaret going to the chiropractor putting your hands on someone is not normal or okay, especially at that age. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is not. I mean, honestly, I didn't have too much of a problem with it because we tune into reality TV for drama. I mean if they were all just like rainbows and dandelions all day. I change the channel, but absolutely, yeah, but  And at their age it is a little bit ridiculous. I mean even at our age at a certain point you just grow up and it's like that's not the way to handle things. You don't even want, you know stuff like that disturbing your piece just remove yourself from the situation. But anyway speaking of situations that you should remove yourself from in Teresa. Pretty much did it Joe? I had no idea he was so disrespectful. I mean, I guess yeah, right right, I mean, but it was just like a refresher because he's been like gone from the chauffeur.  So long, we only hear their phone conversations and they came with the receipts. They came with like the old videos and stuff and I was just like wow, like he was talking about smashing her head against the wall and calling her to be word. I'm just playing a word a lot. He called her stuff that was not her name and stuff. That was not Terms of Endearment. Yeah, and I'm glad that she's in a place where she's like that's not going to fly anymore like  She's regain his confidence like especially when she did her her competition and she was like so discipline with the gym and with eating. I feel like she really found herself and found her own self-worth. So like what did you think about that whole situation? Well, I just I always thought Joe was a toxic person and this just puts the icing on the cake. But this time I think he's toxic in a sense of he's jealous and he's just jealous that Teresa has her freedom and he's locked up and he knows  his fate. Yeah, and it's so disgusting to know that a husband can be jealous of his wife because she's free and able to live her life. But when you are the one that did wrong, you're the one you're the reason why you're locked up and you're the reason why she was locked up and lost her mom while she was in jail and was not able to spend time with her and then you call her knowing she was on a vacation enjoying time with her friends to say something disparaging and to embarrass her on top of that the manipulation.  Shed and just blatant disrespect he has for her to embarrass her in front of Dolores regardless of who else was there to listen to it just shows what a unfortunate blessing it is that he is away from the family and it's like he knew he was about to be disrespectful. He's like put it on speakerphone. I yeah, I want to talk to Dolores and also how he's telling her you have a lot of baggage and no one's going to want you with your four kids. Excuse me, you have you have for kids to y'all got the same ones or is this something we missed?  So you're going to be in Italy with baggage? Like I don't even understand first of all, why would you say that second of all you have the same baggage that she has if not more because at least she's making money right now like she might have four kids, but she also has Empire. I think it's because she Teresa is going to be the one with the kids and I yeah, Joe won't have to physically have the responsibility of being with the four of them. And that's why he considers it baggage. Yeah, but her kids are also  To an age where they don't necessarily need like a babysitter so much like, you know, I don't and also just I don't know like that's just such a toxic male thing to say, you're the woman you're going to deal with the kids like that. I was really at first I was kind of annoyed when Dolores try to justify his behavior because she's like in our culture that's what they do. I was annoyed because I'm like, that's that's so old school and that's not a reason.  But then I always have to think back. You know, what they're all there are cultural factors that go into stuff like that. Like I always say when it comes onto the cultural stuff, I'm Jamaican and there are times where you might hear about a husband knocking his wife up against her head and she's not going to him right back and that's not and it's not like you're gonna call Molina look if you like such thing as like domestic violence. Yeah, but you know, it's just like you hit me I'm gonna hit you back so I can kind of see why she  Came off that way or that was her reasoning but at this point when you have kids involved and you're in such a sensitive climates, like you don't want to play with that and I wonder do the daughters know that he talks to her like that. I mean they probably know from seeing the show, but does he try to hide that when he was around them because they're such Daddy's Girls and we see them all the time and it's so heartbreaking when they're like crying about him. Yeah. So like I'm pretty sure if they see the way he talks to her they wouldn't be  Be as much of a daddy's girl like how you sit there and listen to your daddy. Say I'm a knock your head into the wall. I mean, I don't know because you've seen him physically fight their own Uncle. Yeah, but the at least us to men but that still family's family, but it's not like a man put in his hands with the but I'm saying that to say like if he's will if he will physically fight it you're his brother-in-law what's stopping him from doing that type of stuff to Teresa in front of the kids? Yeah. Well he is so hot  Filter and Joe's out of the house now, so that is that but we also taken into the Hamptons. Yes. The Hamptons was a nice trip. I think it does that really brought like the juiciness out of the episode 2 and Jennifer's house was beautiful. So not Jennifer Jackie. I always get the Jays confused. Plus they're both the newbies but Jackie invited the girls to go to The Hamptons. She's like, hey, all this Mother's Day brunch is getting a little crazy. Let's just go regroup.  Group and have some fun weather's nice blah blah blah. The house was absolutely beautiful beachfront Hamptons house and Little Miss Jennifer who said for herself. She did not come from money. She married and sent it very obvious. She did not come from it's so obvious and that's what they said to us new money because she wouldn't act like that and just be so like a maze like, oh my God money all the time. So Jennifer was just so blown away that Jackie had all this money because Jackie doesn't brag like Jennifer.  As in I like Jennifer Jack in the bush Jackie. I like Jackie for that. So because I find that so annoying when people brag about their money all the time even dudes when they try to use that as like a pick-up line like and they're showing off chains and watches and nice cars great that you have that but if that's what your approaches to try to get someone to notice you they're only talking to you for that. Why would you even want someone like that around you? Like? I don't know if  flashy people annoy me. I think I like I respect the way Jackie handled it because we all know how sensitive she is. But when she admitted that she was bothered by Jennifer's comments, but she still handled it. So well at dinner and it made me less annoyed with her so she slowly becoming kind of a favorite because I like classy wealthy people Jennifer was like do you mind if I keep asking these questions in Jackie's like actually I do but she said it like with the laugh.  Like she stood her ground, but with a laugh. Yeah, so she I guess kind of I don't know made it less of a big deal or whatever or easier to I don't know say you're annoying me but Jennifer just really got obnoxious like as the episode went on and I'm like what is wrong with her and it was like so much in one one. Like I said with Margaret she is having to sell her house because she's at not her whole house, but, you know part of some of her property.  Because she is in debt and she didn't go out and run a venue and try to live above her mean she had her even at her house, you know on the space that she owns and Jennifer's making fun and talking bad about Jackie's party with the kids and giving them Pizza their kids like and I would say wanted yeah wanted pizza and Nutella cake and your mom delivered and they want to be able to go outside and run like, I don't know. I'm sure like when we came up things were different.  Wasn't all this social media and like, you know, like go outside and play ride a bike like do something and I don't know like Jennifer was just ridiculous. I do understand maybe having some more food for the adults because although it's a kids party, you know the adults bring them but girl eat some pizza. Well, I just don't understand where Jennifer gets off talking about Jackie's parenting because last season she was raising hell when Jackie made an article based on  Jean Jennifer's parenting and giving her kids everything mind you the article wasn't even negative because we ended it on a positive note saying how sweet her kids were and that she hopes that they stay that sweet regardless of all the things that they have in their life and here comes Jennifer the very next season tearing her to Pieces because of monetary things and just materialistic aspects and it just makes no sense, especially because she came from nothing. Yeah, she came  Humble and she still doesn't know how to manage with she has because and I agree with Melissa. Melissa is like no Jenna Jackie. I'm so sorry for confusing A J's Melissa's like know Jackie is winning because 30 years from now her kids are going to be set because she's not spending on like whatever Judge Jennifer has this one huge house. Meanwhile, Jackie is is serving her kids pizza, but investing in multiple properties and Jennifer. I mean, I guess truth  hurts because she got very upset and I also think she took Melissa's message wrong. This is message was very aggressive, but it was somebody it was it wasn't like it wasn't anything negative because she included herself in what she was saying. Yeah. He said we're losers. She's the one who's winning and what she was saying was the truth. Yeah, but I think Jennifer is just jealous of Jackie because she doesn't she's living a life that she can afford that she was born into  Everything that Jennifer wishes she was is what Jackie is and that includes some type of level of self-confidence to where she doesn't feel like she has to throw her money around and constantly remind people Jennifer talking about I have the biggest house here, but I don't have a beach house that statement and itself says more about you and your financial responsibility then it does anything else. Yeah, and you're worried about pizza at a birthday party these lavish birthday parties that your kids have.  Have they're going to forget it just as quickly as you say that Jackie's kids are going to forget their pizza party. Now on the same topic while they went at this table having lunch, which I love that they always got to eat at it. It makes me hungry honest topic of while they were at the table and Jennifer through Margaret under the bus. I can't lie. I like that part because yeah, I was waiting for it. Yeah, like why did Margaret bring that up then and there? I mean, it's juicy for us, too.  Viewer I guess but of course, you know that Jackie's gonna take that a certain way and then Jennifer came from the bathroom and just walked into it for real like she had no idea what's going on. Like everybody's chill. Everyone's having a good time. She comes from the bathroom since down like Hey Y'all what's up? And she's just under Fire and under attack. So I'm glad that she you know out at Margaret then and there because the things that Margaret was saying, I mean it's observations but it also was like  Digs at her of course because you know how serious something like an eating disorder is yeah. Yeah, and she's talked about it. She's talked about, you know how depressed and stuff she was and how you know, it affected their relationship with her parents and if the girl is not eating like even I think it might have been Melissa. When when when Jackie said I've been eating all day and someone said really have you because I didn't notice like I don't think you should say stuff like that to a person I don't  No, I don't know. Maybe it's not in a group setting maybe if it's just two people talking and you're really concerned, but I don't know.  I just think that Margaret knew what she was doing. Yeah, and when she tried to say that in her confessional that she I didn't know I didn't say it to make Jackie upset. Okay. I'm sure I don't think she did it to make Jackie upset, but I think she knew she was being molested. It took the guys who knew what she was doing and it would have looked better at least a little bit better. If she didn't wait until Jennifer left the table and then brought it up. Now you just looking at like an asshole. Yeah. Yeah someday.  Was an interesting moment at the table. We saw Jennifer and Melissa get into it which left a very like juicy Cliffhanger for next 3 months throwing stuff. But this time she wasn't drunk when she did it throw hands. Maybe they will not be so she's not throwing hands and Melissa isn't either because all Melissa does is stand up and warn her this is the second time Jennifer has messed with Melissa name anybody else Jennifer has gotten some type of physical altercation.  With hey, I mean she took that drink that's a recent exactly. It was like we know it Teresa will throw hand. I don't understand how she just was like, what? Why did you do that girl? It's like not even talking at that point like that. That was so dumb of Teresa to do that. Like that's not a friend on Teresa's in for her to do that, but I don't know that that's them but want to get into some sweets. Yeah, he's gonna do something to this real quick.  There are a lot of people that were excited to talk about tonight's episode with Jennifer's comments about Jackie's money. Like at reality babbler said it's refreshing to see a housewife with wealth Jackie that doesn't feel the need to wear Janelle airings and what not. Very true. I agree. We were like just talking about that like with how you know, Jackie is just setting herself up like not spending.  Nicholas li like she has money and she just dresses so normal and chill and like she's she shouldn't always finish it. She's confident. She doesn't have to do all that and I'm glad you knew HW was for housewife because out of the said HW. Okay, Carl says according to Teresa Margaret can kiss her ass hole yet. She still wants to be invited to her events. That's what I'm saying. Teresa doesn't know Teresa just has this.  This animosity towards Margaret and instead of just saying you know what I didn't stand up for you with mint with Danielle because I feel some type of way towards you and I'm just not happy with you right now. She keeps making excuses and excuses, but she's mad about not going to her event. Maybe she just really wants Margaret to apologize to her. Yes. Erisa doesn't Teresa doesn't see what she's doing wrong. She wants to ask his her Isa his she has been blowing me the past couple Seasons, but she just wants Margaret. So like  Kiss up to her and like I don't know just rolled out the red carpet for ya. Okay at Love Jones says love how Jackie has all that money in the bank and has and still has to pay for breaks and her cabinet. Okay, I did peep that like, oh they're eating paper plate. That's why I wouldn't I wouldn't serve my guests paper plate. I didn't notice but I mean paper plates are easy because you don't have to do the dishes, but I wouldn't do that for my guess. Yeah.  First time I'm bringing you to my Hamptons house and I'm right just set the ambience like make it Instagram about it. Make it big make it Instagram mobile girl God where our next tweet is from at twink housewife no shade. But how does Melissa have stands? She has no personality or Presence at all. I want to say she doesn't have a personality. It's just that this time. She's not fighting with anybody and that's why she's kind of under the radar.  Little bit which is refreshing. Yeah. I like Melissa. I think that she is a good friend. I think that her and Joe have a cute relationship. She seems like a great mother but yeah, I guess because she's not in drama just like I said, if you don't have the the Danielle pulling the Margaret hair, like people are just gonna tune out so I do like Melissa, she's just she just gets along with people. Yeah. She's an asset to the show. Also Scorpio babe says Jennifer only F so hard with  Lisa because she knows she's not going to do shit and I love it. That's exactly what I said. Melissa's not going to do anything and Jennifer's not going to do anything because she's a bully I don't know so you just have to people that's not going to do anything. So I guess they just yeah same thing as last season. They're just gonna yell. Yeah, and hey, maybe that's what you need to release that frustration. And I don't know. Maybe they should do. You know what I'm saying that for predictions? I mean  Think I'm a right that I'm gonna write that down and come right back to it and then we can get into news. All right. So the new year has just started we are what is today January 22nd and Joe Gorga has already made over two million dollars flipping houses. You y'all want to know how much out of me and he's last 22  Days, not over 2 million, but Joe's really, you know, been taking us house-flipping stuff. Seriously. He posted some shots to Instagram and here's a before we've got a few like before and like during so he's like guess the word is excavated. He's like dug up the property and then, you know putting it up or whatever. I don't know all the building term course, but it is it is and I think that because we had done this show for so long they should let us  Of it what it will be like a trade-off like we we love you guys. We talked about you guys all the time. You know what let's give away a dream home Peter. He goes. Yeah. I'm not to be up the payments. No. No, we don't have to that's the whole thing. Oh, they're going to take care of it for us. Yes, why not wishful thinking? Okay. So, you know congratulations to Joe. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah, and it's  Any two days bed, that's a huge accomplishment that 20/20 vision the latitudes 20 20 and 22 days two million. That's amazing. Let me go play the lottery with straight to choose because I'm barely zeros. I don't know we going to see we're going to see but y'all don't use my numbers but we also use her number if you win I'm coming after you but now we can get into the prediction. Yeah, laughter. Go ahead.  Your prediction is oh my prediction that I just had to write it down because I was like, oh, this is such a genius idea. I think that's a to who just yell at each other the most and ever really do anything. That would be Melissa and Jennifer they should do like a charity boxing match or even Melissa anomalous. I just said her or even Teresa and I think Margaret might be a little Margaret's not gonna fight. Yeah. She's too old. Yeah to be in a boxing match Danielle.  Danielle is gonna run and hide I would take I would pay to see him yellow box of that clip of Danielle says somebody get this girl you too. Scary. Like I've never like I wouldn't even feel comfortable literally talking behind a building like yelling out for help like that. Whatever Danielle you want to pull people's hair than running high like that makes no sense. Yeah them somebody's here. Oh you before in the other clip out of  An illogical oh, but yeah, you want to be big and bad and pull hair but you're also the same one that likes to run and hide so for predictions, I would love to see like the girls who have issues with each other just go ahead and like for a good cause just get in the ring or something like that. Like if they want they can go to training and stuff that'll probably be part of the storyline, you know, don't like I said donate it to charity. I think it'd be interesting the Kardashians did it a while ago like in their early seasons?  My prediction is that even though Margaret says that she's over in past talk trying to convince Teresa about being a better friend. That's a lie. She's not done and I really appreciate the fact that Melissa had was honest with Margaret and told her look stop trying to convince her. It's beating a dead horse. Just be done with it. You said your piece and be over it, but I feel like in more episodes. We're going to see Margaret really pleading.  Teresa a lot more which is getting very pathetic at this point. I felt bad for her and now I'm like Marissa Margaret, you're too old for this. You're too grown. You said what you have to say. All you need to do is look like lower your expectations with Teresa as a friend and keep it pushing. Yeah, and I get it that they have history and they've been friends for a long time. But it's like that does not matter. Sometimes it's like you have to get to a point where you have to protect your peace because she is clearly stressed.  About this relationship and it's like just let it go. It's not work. And Teresa is she's been annoying for a couple of years ago. So just and she had the nerve to say I've never seen Danielle's bad side. Yeah. Yeah. I have no word and then I agreed with Margaret when she said okay Teresa you you are saying I shouldn't have pulled her hair, but when you walked off and talk to her did you say Hey, you shouldn't have thrown any water on her and Teresa didn't answer. She just got up and was like, I  He created I can't take this but that was a good point smile. She was wrong. Yeah, like I mean I get it if Danielle wants to be your friend whatever but still be fair. And like if you're going to tell Margaret something then tell Danielle something to and let me just lastly add that Margaret is not asking to Risa to choose between her and Danielle. It's just that she wants them to she wants Theresa to tell Danielle. You can't treat Margaret like  This the same way she's telling Margaret. She can't treat Danielle like this. That's it. That's there's a huge difference between that and saying to choose so like I said Margaret snot over this thing with Teresa. Yeah, we will see how that drags out, but I'm just excited that when we pick up next week is going to be 2 tablespoons and nothing's gonna happen. I guess I'm throwing somewhere yelling some tea might be spilled, don't you ever yeah.  Your voice is condescending like right exactly, but I'm still excited for it and we'll just have to see you next week. But until then I am Angel Sanders you can find me Instagram at Angel Saunders. You can find me on Instagram at I am be show underscore Cheyenne see hia and any bye guys. Yep. See you next week Keven undergaro and me Maria Menounos would like to thank you for tuning into.

Welcome to the official podcast of FCS fans Nation with your host Skylar Neil Matthew crazy and Lauren Smith.  FCS football fans Nation welcome back to the best podcast for FCS football from the south to the west to the east to the north welcome again. I am your unbiased buys an admin Matthew Frazee back for another outstanding episode. Ladies and gentlemen, do we have a treat for you this morning this afternoon this evening whenever you are listening to the FCS football fans Nation Podcast. Unfortunately my normal boys D log.  Duke dog and my screeching Eagle Kyler Neal are off again this week. So you're thinking right now. Damn do I have to listen to Matt Frazee talk solo again for a whole week. I'm turning this thing up right now. Don't do it. I am joined by two fans of two teams and they are going to be giving their bold awesome opinions and I'm going to be throwing out some facts to back some of these things up guys. I am joined here with mr. Ross.  Nelson a die-hard North Dakota State University fan and mr. Brandon Owens a die-hard Jacksonville State University Gamecock ban. Both excited to be here both big fans of the FCS football fans Nation page. Brandon Owens. How are you doing today, buddy? I'm doing good. I just got done with a workout. So I'm ready to go. He's got his swollen. He's ready to go. Mr. Nelson. Are you did you just do the same what he what he lifted nowadays?  Working out. Yeah eight to twelve ounce Busch Light real that's that's about all the curls I do today. But yeah, thanks for having me on Matt. I've been telling Matt for years if he has ever asked to go solo again that he's got to have me on here. So finally, I talked him into it after too many beers. He got me convinced. But of course I had to bring Brandon on Brandon's a great fan of the page. So are you Ross guys? Let's get right to it. We need to jump right into this because we have a ton of questions.  Questions from our fans always this podcast is Guided by FCS football fans Nation on Facebook and the questions that are posted there. So we'll start from from these. I put two of them together here. This is mr. Christopher Johnson. He says CAA WTF, you can figure out what that means for yourself and I'm going to add that into mr. Collins Sutra question. He asks, what in the heck is happening in the CAA this week Richmond Albany Ilan, New Hampshire with wins their favored were the favorite teams looking.  Way too far ahead. He feels like thousand Delaware Main and Stony Brook fans all feel. Like they had a nightmare this weekend. He wants to know if we have any thoughts and what we saw this weekend and our perspectives will be great for those of you that don't know number nine thousand lost Albanese 38 221 Alberni Albanese actually four and three right now with two losses coming by six points. Shout out to Sam herder from hero sports for that Intel Delaware lost forty two to seven to Ilan absolutely got whooped.  And Maine Lobster Richmond. 24:17. Stony Brook lost in New Hampshire 22:14 Rossum and start with you man. What do you think about the chaos and they see a a and do you find that comparable to like what the Missouri Valley see? He's of team. Just eat each other alive. Yeah, I think every year we see it in the Missouri Valley that you get a bunch of teams that can beat each other up and you have one team at the top maybe to sometimes that aren't going to get beat like that would be like a j mu I think in the CAA.  But and then you got a couple teams at the bottom like our Missouri Missouri State Indiana state that aren't going to beat anybody else, but I think when you're seeing Stony Brook and New Hampshire, I mean a game like that. I think anybody can win that in any week same with Missouri Valley teams, so I don't it doesn't surprise me at all. We see it every year in the Missouri Valley. Absolutely Greg comparable of the conference. Is there some thoughts of my own I was definitely wrong on Main. I thought they were going to be a bounce-back team Kyler and Lawrence. Hit me on  And they're super reeling right now with some losses to coaches and key players. We forgot about New Hampshire and we think that may be a shock that they beat Stony Brook just because they weren't in the playoffs last year after making it 17 years in a row. They I compare them this year to what Eastern was in 2017 like Eastern lost 2017. They were gone, but there are program and they bounce back easy and then obviously we know Eastern went to the championship last year bouncing right off a Roth said power three conference is always going to be competitive.  Of two or maybe three of them at this point are going to get to be in playoff eligible. So it's just those teams eating each other alive while those top two which right now looks like Villanova and JM you are just sitting right on top. So it's not as chaotic as we think because last season kind of did the same thing as a lot of see a team's got into the playoffs. So. Mr. Brannon Owens, I'm going to bounce this next one off you man. This is from an awesome GMU fan Preston atoms. We love him on the page. He says so 1 through 11 in / 12 seems pretty easy.  You right now for a ranking standpoint, is it accurate at this point to say the rest of the playoff contenders is like throwing poo on a wall and seeing what sticks what do we got there? Brandon Owens what we have well to answer is the first part of his question. Yes. Yes. It is exactly what he asked take that if you see for example, we don't know who is getting the auto bid. You have Austin Peay you have Jack State scene mode UT Martin who had an off year.  Last year and they bounce back and pretty much just running through some of their ovc opponents. Those are pretty much your top three as of now for the running for the ovc. Other than that you have Tennessee Tech. You have Murray State who always ruins some chances of ovc teams going to the playoffs. So you have at least five teams in the contention for the ovc championship. Now as for the  Rankings though. I mean you have for 500 BC teams either right or receiving votes. So again below ranked 11 12 325. It can easily be a toss-up for any team from any conference. Absolutely. And for those who don't know the ranked teams that lost last week Villanova had five Montana State who was 6 2009 you and I 1015, Delaware 18, Maine.  Ys you see Mo Stony Brook Southern Louisiana, Sam Houston at 25 tons of teams got upset last week so just like we said in the past Preston, I think that we got some top-heavy top 8 teams this year and it really is like throwing pool at the wall, it's just throwing anything and seeing what sticks because we don't know what these teams are going to be like so great stuff and great comparison with Ohio Valley, that's great Ross Nelson sir we have for mr. Brad Jan's he wants to know Trey Lance is in her  Options this season. Are they going to be 6 over or 6-under? What do you think about Superstar Trail ants at this young age? What's it look like for him in interceptions. I I'm gonna take the under on that. I I mean  I've been watching all year and he's thrown over a thousand yards 15 touchdowns, which isn't huge but you know, there's not been a lot of balls that I have said. Wow. He shouldn't have thrown that you know that was in the tight coverage or across I mean he's had maybe one or two on a deep out route that maybe could have been picked off but there's just hasn't been a lot of passes that I said, you know, that was a poor decision. So I I don't know maybe three maybe four, I mean anything can happen obviously, but he just hasn't, you know, even when  When Easton stick was young there's a lot of passively like you shouldn't have thrown that you know, so and we haven't seen a lot of that out of them yet. Yeah, I'm gonna go opposite of you man. I'm gonna have to go with the over just because I think a bad playoff game and maybe one bad game here against South Dakota state or Youngstown if it happens you could see four interceptions pop out of there and then maybe one or two, you know, two or three more random ones. I'm going to go slightly on the over because I think Vegas wants me to go under Brad. So let me go a little bit opposite there of you. All right guys.  Guys, mr. Brent Evans wants to know he's looking ahead of it. He says I know the playoff field is nowhere near decided but what are some matchups you'd love to see in the playoff between teams that are not meeting during the regular season. He wants bonus points for creativity. So not NDSU and not James Madison. Thanks Brent. Well that question Brandon. Would you love to see for a matchup in the playoffs team versus Team? Let's keep those Duke & Duke sin that buys and out of it. I actually have a few for Jace.  You I would the obvious Kennesaw State. I would love to play Kennesaw State again. That's a great rivalry in the making some people have called it battle for the border. So I would love to play Kennesaw State again in the playoffs. I would love to also play JMU or Montana State some other matchups. I would love to see North Carolina A&T versus Nichols Austin Peay versus Illinois State and you and I versus Sac State that last one would be  be an amazing game to watch. I love Brandi. You've got the playoffs fieldset man. What submitted in those also in Gotham matchups, if you ask me Ross, what do you got for a playoff matchup that you're interested in men? I say the CAA against everybody else in the league with how bad they did last year and shots are fired. Yeah, but if I had to pick one, I'd say anybody who's going to Montana because I think it's going to be hard to play there in the if they continue to play how they are in the cold weather, but I  But you and I against Montana because I think you and I as a playoff team and that's a regional matchup. I think we could see be a good game. Absolutely. These are all be great matchups quickly just on my end one that I would give was Fermin versus Nichols. Give me the top so con team in my opinion versus the top Southland team and a battle the battle of those conferences just outside the power 3 against each other would be really cool kind of like that JSU and Kennesaw feel which is awesome. All right guys another one for mr. Preston.  Adams he says with all the weird results as we can in the top for Missouri Valley team still getting strong. Are we getting closer to maybe seeing a to Lost meac team get an at large bid if they lose only amongst themselves. I'm actually going to take this one guys because I did some really good research on it, press and since 2015 and that's when we both know. That's what that's when the celebration both started. We've had one HBCU team NC A&T make it in the playoffs. And obviously we know they're from the swac. They're not going to me.  And they lost it to Richmond around what but I have NC A&T actually making it so I'm not sure if I'm going to go with two lost me acting getting in because I only think NC A&T is going to be the ones who are going to be able to pull it off South Carolina state has a d to win and an FBS lost family who has a d to win and an FBS loss and bathroom cookman has a cancelled Cielo game and an FBS loss. So right there you're going to look at d 2 ND to win and a cancelled games going to give you one less.  S win on your schedule and that's going to cause you to be one game behind in the committee's eyes. So that's why I'm going to say no for a to lost me at team getting in polyester that tongue-tie. I was definitely going to heavy on the nose Preston, but hopefully that answers your question. All right guys, this is a great one. Jamie Williams asks, which team is the biggest surprise to you so far other than Eastern Washington who he thinks has been the biggest disappointment Brandon. What do you think has been the biggest disappointment this far Dan cock fans? Do not chastise.  Me for saying this but JSU is the biggest disappointment this year. We came off of a five year reign of straight ovc championships and then getting bounced except for 2015 in the playoffs. So the discipline and everything else is there but there is absolutely no team chemistry. I saw it against Austin Peay they there was just no team chemistry. We did try a few things the past.  Two weeks if you knew things on offense and it seemed to work a little bit, but we'll see what happens for the rest of the season. But as of now JSU as the biggest disappointment and rice, what do you think? Who's your biggest disappointment right now biggest disappointment or biggest surprise? I had my biggest surprise would be Sacramento state with how bad they were last year. It's it's your first podcast. I'm going to give you a break. Give me your biggest surprise Buddy Sacramento state with only having I think to to  Last year if they can beat Montana and string together some wins. They're going to be a possibly a seated team. So that would be my biggest surprise. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Those are it's good surprise a good disappointment will see what the rest of the season brings for both those teams as people know. I still have JSU finding a way to get through the valley and winning it and we'll have to see what Sacramento state does against Montana. So, all right Ross. This one's going to go right to you man with North Dakota State blowing out their Missouri Valley opponent so far. Are they crazy? Good in a  What conference or is the Missouri Valley more average? Mr. Hall Jones wants to know this answer. I say it's hard to say until we see play out like the valley teams play in the playoffs because a lot of years it goes back to the question. We had a little bit ago a lot of years. You see the valley beat each other up and you think they're average or they're weak, you know, where you sneak like a western Illinois in with with 4 losses or five losses and then they win a first-round game.  I mean we can look we call season long and then we get wins in the playoffs. I've seen that in the past not saying that's going to happen this year. So I'm going to say that the Missouri Valley is a still above average and we're going to do well in the playoffs. I think if we get enough teams in awesome. Yeah, Western Illinois is with that. They got in barely with about 500 won that first round playoff game the bizon right now actually through 6 games this article just dropped our outproducing.  Last year's teams in the majority of their statistical categories from touchdowns to average points to defensive numbers. So NDSU really is one of those Elite teams. I think like I said before I think there's a huge gap for team's top five through eight right now. I think there's a gap between them and like the rest of the playoff field. So I'm not saying North Dakota state is 10 15 points better than the other Elites that I see like James Madison and like how Montana has been playing, but I do think that  Much better than what like a you and I are Illinois state or a thousand or you know, Stony Brook or something would be so I'm going to say that they are separating the gap between the team's top nine through 25, but not through from the top eight for sure. All right guys with the craziness and the CAA so far. Is it still possible that that conference gets three or few fewer playoff teams? So is it possible that that conference is getting three or less? Mr. Hall Jones. Once again asking another question. Love it Holly.  We really appreciate that Brandon. What do you think? So you're obviously from Jacksonville State your Ohio Valley. What do you think of the CAA? As you know, the quote unquote? You hear the term power 3 a lot. What do you think about them as a conference? Do you think they get three or fewer playoff teams, or are they going to get 3 or 3 plus? All right, so I do my own Bracketology. I just don't post it. It's fun for me to do kind of a little break from school. But the CAA teams I have in after this past.  Week is JMU Villanova UNH and then Albany is in my first four out. There's a very high chance that they only get three in but there's also a very high chance that they get for in. I don't think they will get more than four in we will not have another year where the CAA gets five teams in it's still too early to call though. So we'll have to wait and see later on in the season after everybody plays everybody. I love  all you ended that answer because it rolls right into my thoughts man, which is it all depends on the rest of the field. If the rest of the non power three conferences have a bunch of two or three loss non-auto bids that can harm like a power three conference the CAA from getting teams in but if the valley are Big Sky is a bunch of weaker teams outside the top three or four and their conferences that may open up more spots for the CAA to Navin extra team. So it's still early but definitely possible. It could only be three, but it could be more. I mean I hate to not be able to give a firm answer.  You're going to hear more about how many teams the power 3 get in Hall later in the podcast will keep on listening man. All right, Ross since you have one and Brandon you've got one too. Do you think having a loud Stadium or extreme weather is a better home field advantage Tyler. I'm going to butcher your last name told Jess. I'm going to go with Tyler tojust so correct me on the page man, Roz. What do you think louder Stadium or extreme weather? What's a better home field advantage? I think it depends on  On what kind of offense you run or people coming in run? You know what I mean? Like if you're running team and you go to Montana.  We saw our sorry Eastern Washington. They're playing outside is cold, but they were a passing team. They lost the mm. You know, when thousand had Terrence West and they were running team, I think.  I like allowed Stadium. I never got to be around back in the Dakota field days. I think back when NDSU was running the option. It was huge to have the outdoor field in the cold weather because we never passed the ball. So we're killing teams on the ground and they couldn't pass the ball defense ate them up. I think now with a more balanced approach. I think the loud stadium is more important to NDSU good answer Brandon. What do you think? Obviously you guys aren't in  ORS, but you do get super loud there with Gamecock Nation and you've got some extreme weather stuff to deal with to what do you think man?  I'm actually gonna agree with Ross the noise does play a factor, especially at JSU because you have fans that once Jace you starts doing really well in a game they get on their feet. They get loud. They throw the team off same with the student section. But the biggest Factor at JSU is the band. Our band is the loudest band and the biggest band in the nation as of right now in my opinion for the loud for the loud part. But again, it also depends on the  Team, some teams aren't necessarily very loud for the fan base, but they have the weather that can play a factor in it. I'll take Jace you versus Eastern Washington Eastern Washington came out punching Us in the mouth, but our lap our noise Factor got really. Well really good in the game the longer it went because Jace you started performing really? Well the band played a factor the fans played a factor in everything even the weather played a factor it was  Very evident in that Eastern Washington game that Eastern Washington got worn down by the heat. Also JSU has struggled in the cold weather. We got blown out by main. We got blown out by North Dakota State and Frisco cold weather is definitely not our friend, but I agree with not with Ross. It's definitely a lap the loud Factor plays a really huge part in a stadium. Can I say one more thing Matt? The only other thing I would say about the loud versus the  Is you can't shut the weather off if it's cold if it's snowing if it's raining if the opposing team say comes into the Dome and they put up a touchdown or two on us right away. You know, it doesn't happen very often. But if it does that takes the crowd out of it big time. I mean you could feel the energy drop out of that Dome. So if there's a team that can could maybe put up points early. You can take some of the energy out of the dolman kind of control the game that way and you can't do that with the weather. So I mean, it's a toss-up.  For me outstanding point in James Madison 2016 definitely did that 17 left off guard and you felt the whole thing go boom, you know, you can't turn off the snow. Great Point man guys good answers. We're moving into the next question because we got a ton to get to I got this one. Why am I the most annoying person in the existence of the world asks Adam Willie Adam? I don't know why you do this to yourself man. I have a simple answer for you. You're not an extremely psychotic biased fan. You're always very nice to people on the page. So you are  Our from the most annoying person in the existence of the world. So not even close. All right, what currently unranked team could go on a winning streak and get an at-large spot. Mr. Scott. Moffat wants to know that Brandon. Do you have a team you think that could really start getting hot not get the out of bed, but get an at-large spot easily Simo if Simo Beach Jack State this weekend. We are out of the playoffs completely. There's no chance unless complete chaos happens in the  Big three which I think will happen. We will not make the playoffs if see my Beats us Simo could win JSU that they could gain momentum throughout the ovc and you could possibly have to ovc teams. That isn't JSU in the playoffs this year. That would be something that would be crazy and new myself personally. I got Wofford they've got to early bad losses, but they're 2 and 1 in conference play. So they're going to have to be firm in in my opinion.  And then the Citadel at the end of the season, but they could be right back where we thought the Terriers could be at the beginning in the preseason as we all know, the Terriers were preseason ranked and besides those two early bad losses that they can just run the conference and you know, I'm actually going to Auto bid with the situation if they can run all the way through they could be looking at Auto bitter that at large spots. So I'm going to go with Wofford on that one. All right, guys, this one's going to be a little off from football. That's okay. We answer all these like we say every single week on the podcast.  Mr. Brandon Anderson wants to know if it's applicable. What is your favorite Pokemon? Alright, I got to ask Ross. Did you ever watch Pokemon we ever guy never even had a Game Boy? No, I never I'm a Sega Genesis guy and I never played Pokemon never had a card. My little brother did but no not for me. Not for Ross Brandon. We're going to Pokémon guy. Did you have one at first? I was not I was more into Digimon actually. Oh my boy.  Hey, I didn't have cable Growing Up So Digimon Digital Monsters. We had to have the I want I went to a brothel less impressive. Oh man, but some of us we couldn't afford that fancy Pokémon stuff, but later I got into Pokemon because all my friends were and my favorite Pokemon actually is totodile. He is a small crocodile water-type Pokémon the noise that he makes when he says his name is just absolutely adorable. He is my absolute favorite.  Pokemon awesome. And yeah, I'm glad you said Digimon you beat me to it. I watch that growing up on Fox. I didn't have cable growing up and then I saw the character Mewtwo. I hope I'm saying that right and I thought he was really cool. I know he's like one of the main ones so it's kind of a cop-out answer but that's what got me into looking into Pokemon was Mewtwo. So there you go Brandon. You got a whole minute there of Digimon Pokémon. So all right back to football guys. Mr. Scott Lawson wants to know is the Citadel making the playoffs and he does a laugh face. I'm going to take this.  They're not. Nope. Citadel's not make the playoffs. They're gonna lose to Furman and then they'll be done despite their Georgia Tech FPS win. So nice FPS win for them, but they're going to lose the Furman and not sure whether the rest of the season plays out, but I'm going to call that right there. So great FPS upset though. All right. I have a question here from mr. Brandon Owens. Brandon Owens is actually Jacksonville State fan. He has asked questions commonly. So he asks in each ear opinions what conference is gained and lost bids this weekend.  Of course Brandon, you did not expect to be on the podcast this week. So why don't why don't we get your answer man? What conference is gained and lost business week since it's your own question going back to my Bracketology. I actually had the CAA lose a team in Towson after their loss against Albany, but I actually had the Southland game a team and I had the ovc switch out teams.  So I switched out Austin Peay and Tennessee Tech. Got you good I disagree with you a little bit that you say the Southland gained one, right? Correct? Yeah, I think the Southland I just think looking down the line they're going to eat each other up and I think Nichols is actually the only team that gets in there but I like the Ohio Valley thing. I think Austin Peay beating SEMO May gain some traction. So I think that's a good one kind of those off non-power three conference.  I think are doing really well. But I think the Big Sky gain one too. Just by the Sacramento State win because I think Montana States not going to fall off a cliff. So that's a playoff team and then Sacramento State now has put them in a position to be a playoff team. So I think the Big Sky may have gained one as well. All right Ross at this one is a two part question, but half of its Missouri Valley. So first one is how many Flamin Hot Cheetos can you eat in one sitting and can slash will Youngstown State make the playoffs?  That's for mr. Joshua Hoffman. What do you think Ross Flamin Hot Cheetos? I've never tried them. I don't mind hot stuff. I had about six bowls of chili in the last two days. So I'm good with hot stuff. I've never tried a Flamin Hot Cheeto, but I'm guessing I could handle as for Youngstown State.  They can definitely make the playoffs. I mean, they only have two losses and they still have to play NDSU and Illinois State who I mean think what you want about Illinois state, but it's still going to be a quality game. They be they even play Us close and if that's their their only their third loss on the year. Yeah, they can definitely make the playoffs with only three losses. So they had a tough week last week against up to go to state. They played him close, but  You and I lost by a touchdown and 10 points to SDSU. I think they can definitely make the playoffs. So we'll see what happens. It's pretty early yet. Obviously only halfway through but yeah, we'll have to see how they perform against North Dakota State. Honestly. I think that's their only chance just because the last two weeks have been against you and I and South Dakota State team South Dakota State's making the playoffs you and I will see they could be Fringe but Youngstown I really thought they had to grab one of those two games because now if they lose the NDSU and even if they beat  Illinois State Illinois State's going to be the only team they're going to be able to rest on to say look at our resume. Look how good it is because they're out of conference schedule was really really poor. So I think it completely relies on North Dakota State and if they don't beat them, I do not see them making the playoffs. So James Allen is Eastern Washington the most overrated team coming into a season this decade. I want both your opinions on this Brandon. What do you think as Eastern the most overrated team this decade that one question I have written.  Down is have you heard of JSU and Sam Houston State, but but but yeah, I mean no Eastern is not overrated even after that loss against Jack State and their slight decline. No, they're not overrated Roz. What do you think most overrated team coming into the season? Yeah, I think for sure they you go from being a runner-up in the championship game to you're not going to make the playoffs and we knew that after week what last week or two weeks ago.  Yeah, I think they're the most overrated team this decade. They've done it before and like Brandon was talking about. I mean, there's there's been overrated teams before but I think even with their losses, I think everybody thought with their head coach they have that they were going to come in and be competitive again and to go from like I said to go from a championship possibly if any issue doesn't make the championship last year. They probably win that Championship to not making the playoffs and we knew that in the first half of the Season. Yeah, I'd say  It's the biggest disappointment or the biggest over a team coming into a season in the last decade for sure. I'm going to give one comparable here. I think that may have been worse Southern Illinois in 2010 guys football team finished five and six after they were preseason number five the year prior. They're 11 and 2 and they were three seed and they lost a game in the quarterfinals, but they had high expectations five and six and from a five seed. So. Alright guys, it's pick time Montana or  Oh State this Saturday go Grizz says Alan Avital. What do you think just a quick reasoning why Brandon? Who do you think wins Sac State or Montana? Just because I want to see the Big Sky and complete chaos. I'm going sex tape go Hornets. Here you go, Ross. What do you think? Yeah. I'd like to see Sacramento State win for sure. I always like a team that's going from two wins to possibly making the playoffs and they're going to need to beat Montana do that. It's going to be tough to go into Montana.  I'm gonna take Montana at home. I'm gonna go with Ross as well Montana at home. I said Sacramento State last week though to be a top team. You needed to be one of the Montana's and split the series. So Props to you guys. You did it. You're you're the real deal. I love it. Chris lamb wants to know how did you Hampshire become good all of a sudden and I just got to say Chris. I'll take this one Max Prosper the new quarterback who's taken over for Knights who graduated last year. He's played great coach at is come in and  Up, the culture kept the program rolling has allowed a storied program. I mean what 17 straight playoff appearances before last year finally missing one. I compare New Hampshire. Like I said the Eastern Washington Eastern Washington a great story program and programs. Don't stay down long 2017 miss the playoffs Fringe and then in 2018 back near title game not say New Hampshire's going to the National Title this year, but they are back because programs don't go away forever always said that all right. This one's just  For you Brandon if you pinch yourself and it hurts, are you too strong or you too weak Elijah? Pierre wants to know man since I don't have all the admins here Elijah. We're just going Brandon's answer. What do you think man for me? It's a mind game. But I also don't want to go around pinching myself. Randomly. I say too strong.  Too strong. He's too strong Ross. Mr. Adam Peterson wants to know is this red term team red a red term. Woo hyuk Redbird team different from the last few years. He says they typically go on a losing streak that costume the playoffs. But this year after Andy's you beat them bad. They looked well prepared against SIU and it feels different. Do you think this red bird team makes the playoffs this season? I mean they were only halfway through the year again. I go back to that, but you have you  He's down South Dakota State you and I still coming up on their schedule. Really. They don't have any Goodwin's Southern Illinois. He's if they win out. Yeah, they're going to make the playoffs obviously if if they lose to you and I and South Dakota state with 4 losses. I mean how many we could have a lot of teams it's looking like we could have a lot of teams in the valley with 4 losses for five losses. You know what I mean? I'm going to say, I mean, I don't it's so early in the season 2  To say that but I'll say yeah, they're going to make the playoffs. I don't know if they're any different than they have been in the past. They bounced back with a win over not so good Southern Illinois teams. So we'll see what happens in the next four or five weeks with them. Absolutely. They've got to their got to get to the point of their schedule to way Youngstown did where Youngstown had you and I in South Dakota State and you're like show me something or Sacramento state has Montana Montana State and you're like show me something so now Illinois State when you get to those other matchups that  Like the mid tier rankings like you got to show us something and that's going to give you a chance to make the playoffs. I'm with you Ross. I think Illinois state is one of those teams because I'm not high on you and I this year, so I'm going to go with Illinois state to be in the playoffs. All right guys with the loss to Al Bundy. What chance would you give mm? I'm missing the playoffs with their remaining schedule. This is from Jordon Kendall Jordan unless I'm wrong. I believe you're a big-time towels and fam. I did some good research for you man, because I respect you on the page as do I with all people but  8 & 4 is going to give you guys kind of a shot. If you go five in one the rest of your games and only lose to James Madison because let's break down your schedule a little bit one of your losses. It was an overtime super close game to Villanova. Who in my opinion is going to be a top seed Villanova is going to be up there. I think James Madison might be their only loss. You need to Hope though that Stony Brook and Delaware or Maine which our previous wins for you are viewed as quality wins at the end of the season you can't  Stony Brook, Delaware and Main just fall off a cliff like Delaware getting killed, you know by Elon if those teams are actually looking quality than your resume is going to bolster. And if you've only lost the JMU going out, you've got eight wins on your resume and upset of James Madison almost locks you for sure unless you fall fall apart the rest of the way out, but I think 8 and 4 with quality on your resume from other teams performing. Well can get you into the playoffs Jordan so to be  And but I think you could have a shot there. All right, guys, we got another prediction here Matthew. Sandy wants to know with Idaho State taking care of you Andy and Portland State blowing Idaho way who will win the battle of the domes? Obviously the big rivalry between Idaho and Idaho State out there in the Big Sky Brandon. Who do you think between those teams the vandals are The Bangles who's going to win this one? Well, we saw the vandals kind of show a little bit of spark when they beat Eastern Washington after they lost to  You but Idaho state has just been looking good the past couple of weeks. I'm gonna take Idaho State. It's going the Bengals. What do you think Ross which one of those Idaho teams is going to be taken it. Yeah, I'll take Idaho state to with with the win over over North Dakota. They blew them out North Dakota is had shades of being decent this year big loss to Montana, but I think Idaho State never allowed in this podcast again if you're going to disagree  Be with me like this Idaho only lost to Wyoming by Five Points only lost a weaver by 6 and they beat while not a good team this year a program program style team in Eastern Washington. So I think Idaho State really has only been UND as a quality win. So I'm going to go Idaho and I'm going to take them by 10 points. So there you go, Chris Hammond. I got you man, 10 points for your vandals over Idaho State we might have to have a beer bet on that one guys.  All right, Dustin pyramid is concerned as a South Dakota State fan Ross. He believes that they have a Bend but not break defense and an offense that will sputter and spurt which may cause two to three losses for them going into the playoffs are his concerns valid or is he holding South Dakota state to too high of a standard as a number three, he figures they would have had a blowout win by now, but they are just seeming to get by so what do you think? I mean, you're obviously advise of an you seen South Dakota State a lot. What do you think about them this year South Dakota state?  He's me always you know that you sat by me with plenty of South Dakota State Games. And what scares me the most about on this year is that they do have a good defense. I think that if they can continue to play good defense. Yeah, they haven't blown anybody out. But if their offense starts clicking and saying that they're going to you know could possibly have three losses. I don't think that's going to happen. They're going to be Missouri State Illinois State uni, South Dakota Indiana State. They couldn't they have us at home.  I mean there's a have any issue at home it I don't know. I don't think I think at most are going to have the two losses the FPS and to NDSU and I think they'll be a top eight seed for sure. It is a little alarming that they haven't blown anybody out because they've played Southern Illinois Youngstown Ohio. They be Youngstown by 10. I don't know. I think South Dakota state is good. I don't think they'll have more than two losses on the year. And I think there'd be a top eight seed. So NDSU celt NDSU fans.  Say Ross NDSU young team goes to South Dakota state next week. Who wins that game. It's not a question for fans. I'm just curious for me. Yeah, what do you think? I think we went I think we're going on the feet of this year. Obviously, nobody has shown that they can slow us down SDSU as a good defense, but you and I we had a really good defense. I mean you can talk about matchups all day. I don't think you're going too slow or offense down and our defense is playing a way better than we thought they were going to this year. So I'm taking us.  Yeah, for sure NDSU Brendan. I won't have you next week and now I'm just generally curious. What do you think South Dakota State North Dakota State? Neither of them are losing this weekend against Bad opponents. What do you think who wins it? I'm actually going with the Jacks because it is at South Dakota State last time NDSU went to South Dakota State they lost so I'm going jack rabbits who man guys I'm gonna Mark these beer bets down for sure. Then we did we lose last time. We went to ASU. Yeah, man. Yep, they they beat  They'd beat us to the last three times South Dakota State. Obviously, we'd beat them last year in the Border battle. But as you would beat us in the dome three years ago and two years ago Easton stick handles right five interceptions in South Dakota State be uh, so jack rabbits are good. It's going to that could be a battle for the one or two seats. So it's going to be great. All right, we don't want to get too much into next week's episode because that's going to be a lot of discussion points. We're halfway through the 12th Game season guys, Scott Moody wants to know what are the minimums for a team from each conference to make the playoffs.  For an at large. So this is great to have you guys both here. So I want to get your opinions Brandon. What's the minimum for a team? You think in the Ohio Valley how many losses can a Ohio Valley team have and still make the playoffs how many losses going to soak on team have and still make the playoffs and then Ross I'll get you with like the CA and Big Sky. What do you think Brandon in the socon? I think your minimum teams in the playoffs will be too I think it's going to be firming and UTC I'd say about  Three to four wins for the socon and I'd say a minimum three wins for though BC or three losses. Yep. I got you there sir. We understand and then Ross. What do you think man for the power three conferences? How many losses can a team afford to have? Well, I think we've seen it before you can it depends on your schedule and how you put how it all plays out. We've seen you and I get in with five losses before in the valley. They get five teams in it all depends on  Who beats who beats up Who and the in the end of the year here? I think Big Sky could get for CAA. We saw it last year. They got six. I don't think that's going to happen this year that like we were talking earlier this CA might only get three this year three or four I they won't get less than 3. I don't think the big Big Sky CAA, Missouri Valley. I mean unless you don't qualify for the playoffs. I don't think you get less than 3 I'd say Big Sky. It looks like they could get Montana.  Sacramento State if they keep playing. Well Weber State possibly Montana State caaaakes the same thing they could get three or four I think.  For loft. That's three three or four losses. You're still going to have a shot in any for losses in any of those big conferences? You're going to have a shot at making the playoffs especially if one of those losses is FBS that's going to be a big one auditory for all teams. So wrapping that one guys, I'm going to say 8 and 4 to 7 and 5 with an FBS winter big upset win for power three conferences can still get you in there. And I think nine and three at worse for like an Ohio Valley team. So Khan has shown in the past. They can get like a for lost time.  There for sure. So hopefully I got a I got a question for you Matt. What how does that how does that change with what a 12 game season instead of 11 again. Do you see I mean do they say a 6 loss team with really quality wins. Are they going to be allowed in? I mean that's what changes with that having the 12-game year. I think the most effective thing is going to be the fact that some teams have were four scheduled to put division two opponents on their on their schedule and that's going to actually put  M1 wind behind a lot of teams because the committee's not going to look at a division to win as an actual win. So like we ran this hypothetical on our page today, you know a bunch of teams are 11 and 1 somebody said well Kennesaw kugo 11 and 1. Well, they had of schedule an NAIA team and a D2 team and they would be viewed as 9 and 9 and 1 not 11:1. So I think the FBS performance how well you did against an FBS team combined with how close and how big your losses are are much more.  There's so much more important because you have that extra game and it shows how good of your how good your performances so I think it expands on your out of Conference Division 2 FPS has and big matchups in your out of conference schedule. That's my personal opinion on it. So. Alright guys, we've got a few more here Dustin right wants to know some have Villanova dropping in the polls and he does not like that the game played out like a number two verses number 5 five should of what could they have done differently to not drop so much.  Take it to overtime. I mean he obviously knows they could have won this, you know move up but he wants to know if they really deserve to drop by UC Davis basically stayed in the same spot. Just some information here Villanova did drop down a number seven myself personally. I think everybody can be justified above Villanova Dustin besides Kennesaw at number 6. So NDSU SDSU Montana Weber James Madison, I think all five of those teams, obviously JMU beating them you can just  By okay, these teams are as good as or better than Villanova. Can Assad. I think they're they're just because of the record they have not played up to par competition. So I would not have dropped them below Kennesaw. So but I still would have moved them down a spot with how well Montana has played and Weaver has played. So what about you guys if you guys were you guys are you guys are fans? Obviously, we're all fans. But Brandon, would you move teams down if they played that well against a big team like James Madison, or do you kind of keep them warm?  They're at yeah, I'm gonna move you down because you lost I know that sounds harsh. But that's how the polls work. Even if you have a close loss to a top five team like James Madison or North Dakota state if you lose you're gonna at least drop one spot Ross. Are you? Okay Sam and you're like, okay, you've got to drop at least one or are there exceptions to you have a chance to stay where you're at. Yeah, I think you pass.  They could have stayed where they were at just because of chemist Kennesaw who they are and Montana didn't play you possibly could have stayed the same but I've always said, you know, if you're number one playing number four or two playing Five whatever you're going to flip your you know, your award is that if you win that game, you're going to switch places with who you played you're going to be one or two. I mean more than likely because you're you're in the top five your record says it so yeah you're going to  I think normally you're going to drop a few and they only drop two spots are a couple spots. Montana didn't play so that was a little weird because if Montana would have played in one you would have said, yeah for sure. They would have gained those spots. I think you're going to drop no matter. I don't think they could have they could have played that game and lost by a point and they were still going to drop because it's still a loss and Villanova has nothing to worry about because in my opinion they're going to win. I think they're winning the rest of their games and you're going to sit there with  Literally one lost to James Madison by 40 I think was 14 points apologize. If I'm incorrect that's going to be our one lost in the committee's going to go ding this team. You know, this is the same way you view North Dakota State South Dakota State as possibly being top four seeds. You could look at James Madison and Villanova. So I mean, I think we're coming into a collision course of chaos for those top seeds, you know, South Dakota State North Dakota State who wins that one Villanova James Madison Montana fakie.  Keep winning. It's going to Kennesaw. Where do you put them at? It's going to be a battle for those top eight seeds. It's going to be crazy. I think it's going to really blow up here as we move forward. So and we're always you know, you're always going to see there's always that surprising a loss. I mean every year it seems like there's that surprising loss in the last two weeks of the season. I mean, what was it Jam? You last year had that surprising lost. Yep. You'll be coast and right along saying holy cow, you know, we know the top four seeds for sure and then somebody  Is out of nowhere and throws a whole Ranch and all of our predictions. So I think we're too early in the season. But yeah, Villanova's got nothing to worry about we've seen it before at NDSU where we drop after a loss and you move right back up into the top spots. So for sure Brandon, how do you view this man is Jacksonville State band? Oh hi ovalle fan. Do you want the chaos? Right you want all these genes eat each other alive. Just tell me your overall opinions in terms of like we're moving into little bit of a different.  Topic but about that seating stuff. Well, what do you think well going back to last year when we lost Simo and North Carolina A&T at the beginning and middle of the Season we were like if we keep winning we're going to go up in the polls. Anyways, so leading up to the Kennesaw game. I mean that was a game that was going to play a huge factor into the seating. So I think it really just depends on who you have.  To play and the chaos that happens above you in the polls very cool. I love the perspective difference between where you're from and what conference you have. It's really super unique. It's awesome guys. I'm glad we're going to do this. All right speaking of figuring out and learning new information. I have been diving into the hbcus this year because I'm part of Derrick Thomas has Pick Em challenge, which has been great. I'm not doing awesome at it. But I'm going to have Derek on the podcast one of these days this year, so  I can discuss hbcus a little bit more the way the season is shaping up at midpoint. He sees the possibility of two hbcus that can finish the regular season 9 and 2 and not qualify for the celebration Bowl. So Garrett Meyer wants to know what do you think about two at-large bids this year between HBCU teams? So Garrett is convinced that there could be a good possibility that we see two of those teams in there. So I actually delve into this stuff with hbcus and the history and  Take a look at it your gear so I think they can get one and here's my reasoning behind it. We all know the FCS has 10 out of its for the conference winners. So we know what 10 FCS playoff spots are going to be. Let's go back to 2015. That's the year the celebration Bowl actually began. We obviously I've seen that in that NC A&T has been the one HBCU team that made the playoffs since that time. I was in 2016 and they made it but let's break down like the peeled on a big  level to make this make more sense.  Last year in 2018 Ten teams outside of the auto bids came from the power three conferences of the CAA Big Sky in Missouri Valley four at-large bids that left for leftover spots in 2017. Nineteen's outside. The auto bids came from the power 3 4 at large has in 2016. Actually the year NC A&T made it nine at large has came from the Big Sky see a Missouri Valley.  And in 2015 9 at large has came from the power three conferences. My basic breakdown is if I lowball it to okay, the power 3 is outside of the auto bids are going to get an additional nine to ten teams that's going to leave the hbcus and up after they send their top two teams to the Celebration Bowl their third fourth best teams have to compete for four or five spots amongst the entire FCS outside of the Ivy Leagues.  I mean, I just don't see a possibility where this season we're going to see two hbcus take that fourth or fifth, you know, the four five spots that were made. So it's extremely competitive the even getting those four five spots if the power three conferences maintain how they are with the Big Sky see a Missouri Valley. So hopefully that little historical throwback kind of lets you see why I don't think there will be two hbcus. I do think we could get one this year. I just don't think we're going  To get to so all right guys at the halfway point for the season who are your favorites for the bouquet Buchanan and Payton Awards Miranda gear runs to no hero Sports actually drop this article today. So check that out Miranda. They have a great voting poll where the fans are voting on who should be the favorites for these Awards, you know defensive player offensive player of the year Brandon. Who do you think should get these Awards right now? If at the halfway point who's your FrontRunner for the Buchanan award? It's actually the  Into 10 two players that call from Simo and jibreel Cox from NDSU both have just played outstanding defense this year. So they them for me are my top two Runners for that for the Buchanan award Walter Payton for me. There's no contest. I really haven't watched any other quarterbacks other than Eric Berry a but the Eastern Washington's performance has kind of taken him away.  From the Walter Payton in my opinion. So I have zero at Cooper from JSU Cooper coming in. I have Dante Olson from Montana with sixty nine tackles already this year for the Buchanan. He had a hundred and fifty-one tackles last year like NFL prospect Beast. So if you already had sixty nine tackles nice, you know a hundred fifty one last year. I think Dante Olson is a really good pick for that and then I've got Trail ants and Dalton Sneed as my Payton Award winners. I'm  Montana again, the Grid's are going to love me Dalton's need has played really well 15 passing touchdowns for rushing touchdowns and Trail and obviously with I think about those same statistics both leading top seed teams. So I like those guys for Peyton and be counted towards Ross. Do you have one for either the offensive or Defensive Player of the Year this year? Yeah, I think for the Payton award I think Barry a I mean yeah their team's not doing so good. But he's got to 2,200 yards. I think and 20 touchdowns and we're halfway.  Way through the year six more games, he put up another 2,200 yards and you have 44 hundred yards and 14 touchdowns. We've seen in the past that I mean last year stick was up for the for the Peyton and they go a lot off a stats and not so much about how you finish or how you do. I think Barry a can win that and I think for defense is too early to say because a lot of times it seems like they go straight off a stats and you really I mean,  Olsen could have a hundred fifty hundred sixty tackles again, and then he's probably a shoe and he was number three last year, but gibreel is not having quite as good a year as he had last year. I don't think I think our defense is better as a whole maybe but he's just not having the outstanding performance. I don't think he's going to win it. We've seen it before NDSU they play so well as a group that nobody really has the stats. You got a guy you get 16 sacks, you know.  And a hundred some tackles. You're probably going to get it. I'll say Barry a for the Peyton and I'll go with Olson for the Buchanan just because I think he's gonna he's going to turn it on in the second half. They got they play better opponents not so different opinions. So I think it's going to be coming down to those folks will see how that hero Sports voting goes to shout out to a salmon Brian and hero Sports is always for being great outlets for this information guys. Alright final last ones these questions. There's three of them actually come from Twitter guy.  Guys, mr. At Village underscore Terrier Village underscore Terrier die-hard big-time Wofford fan. He called me out a little bit last week and he said the podcast is not dive in enough to the important stuff with the socon the Ohio Valley and with HBCU teams. So I let him toss me three questions. I'm going to be doing a way better job diving into these things. It's not going to be face value answers first Brandon. Don't feel bad like you need to dive in big because I got these ones with heavy answers, but I want to  Your opinions on his questions first before I throw my thoughts out there he wants to know if thoughts on the whole Ohio Valley playoff race other than Jacksonville State. What do you think about teams? That could be making it? Well first that ovc playoff race, this year is a lot like the CAA race last year. It is absolute pure chaos. Nobody there's no there's no clear winner as of right now, but as of right now I have JSU SEMO Austin Peay, Tennessee Martin, maybe Tennessee Tech.  Tech I was high on Eastern Kentucky at the beginning of the year, but I obviously was very wrong about that. So but again Murray State has a very high chance of ruining somebody's chances of going to the playoffs Marie. Yeah my research I was looking through them with Mike. Oh man, they're kind of the outlier here. This could be interesting. I'll ask you a second one two, and then I'll take over there Brandon what are wofford's playoff chances that they lost a Furman but beat everybody else by three scores obviously Village Terrier. He's a big Wofford fan.  What do you think about their chance if their chances with you doing your bracket tearing and stuff if they lose this week to Furman they are if they lose deferment period they will be out highest quality wins at this point left on their schedule our Furman and UTC and again don't count out Mercer in the socon. They are like Murray State they will ruin somebody's chances of going to the playoffs and also that South Carolina State lost at the very  Genin of the year really hurt them. So unless you went out you will not go to the playoffs love the answers, man. And I'm going to tell you mine right now, mister Village Terrier ready. I got all three your answers here for you bud thoughts on the Ohio Valley playoff race other than Jacksonville State. All right. So let's look at a man right now. We got Tennessee Martin at three and oh in conference play Austin Peay to and oh Murray State to and 1 J SQ 2 & 1 Simo 101 Eastern Kentucky one in one app. It's actually really close and chaotic.  Looking into I'm like man. This is like no joke, but we do know that Austin Peay already be JSU and they get the host Tennessee Martin. So I actually like them right now as the Ohio Valley winners because I think their schedule is most favorable. So outside of Murray State on the road all their easy games, which are three of the bottom for Ohio valley teams are on the road. So the easy ones come on the road that may be tougher ones come at home. They'd already be Jacksonville State. So I really like Austin Peay if I'm going other than Jacksonville State,  As part of the question, you know, we got a knock that out. So I think Jacksonville State actually beats Murray State at home to ruin their chances. So I think Murray State's going to drop down and let's take a look at Tennessee Martin. They have to go to see Mo and Austin Peay and play JSU at home. That is brutal. So, I mean you're on the road to two of those teams and you've got Jacksonville State coming to your house. I think that's the toughest slate. So I'm not as sold on Simo or Eastern Kentucky is Brandon is I may be less educated for sure. I'm not as old as soon  Simo Tennessee Martin definitely going to be tough. So Austin Peay man outside of Jacksonville State. That's who I really like Jeremiah was Phil Beast recruit a gem sign in 2017 for their recruiting class. I like his quarterback play. So there you go, man. I'm gonna go with Austin Peay your Terriers their playoff chances that they lost a Furman but everyone else beat everyone else by three scores. Let's take a look into that. They have to be firm in I'm 100% on with Brandon Owens baby Fuhrman they got  A shot. Well, let's take a look at a comparable. Make nice in 2017 was nine and two they had a win over Addy to Florida Tech. So their agent to in the committee's eyes and they weren't the auto bid. They had a two point loss to nickels and a 30 point loss of Central Arkansas Central Arkansas one the south from that year and make nice missed the playoffs at 9 and 2 8 and 2 in the committee's eyes.  Looking into the soul con back in 2017 Furman Sanford and Wofford were all playoff teams, but they were all really good and Wofford actually got the auto bit that year.  So let's jump to the present man in 2019 Furman is the only ranks o Conte. That's it. Not like 2017 where there are three ranked quality teams throughout their firm is the only currently ranked 1 so they're going to lose to Clemson in this hypothetical obviously Watford is losing the Clemson who's on their schedule and in my hypothetical they're losing affirming because I don't think they'd beat them. So they're sitting at 8:00. And for my question for you Village Terrier is where is the quality win?  I mean you look at Kennesaw and their strength of schedule. We're looking for any quality win. If there isn't one ranked team within those eight wins. I don't see how it's Justified that you get into the playoffs.  Because in 2017 seven and four Furman, they lost to 92 Wofford by one point and beat Western Carolina who is ranked at the time and was ranked 6 weeks throughout the season. So that's some quality and in 2017 Samford beat Furman who is a playoff team that year so they got that quality. That's what put those teams in the playoffs. So unless A ranked opponent rests on the resume. They won't be in the playoffs at 8:00 and 4:00 with blowout wins. They'll be that Fringe bubble, but I don't think they'll get in at 84 without quality.  So the teams they beat you've got to Hope move up into the committee's eyes as a nice win. So I'm going to say at 84th lost the firm and it's not going to happen. I hope you see some justification in that some deep diving your last question our last one for the podcast guys chances of South Carolina state or NC A&T making the playoffs at large at eight and three given their out of conference wins. So we're back to hbcus. Let's take a look at NC A&T when they made it in 2016 celebration Bowl obviously exists. So we  To use comparables to the world. We live in now I'm not going to go pre 2015 2016 NCAA and TB Kent State who was an FBS opponent. Their only loss was to North Carolina Central who won the meac that year and they lost a Tulsa who's an FBS. So they were a one FCS loss to the champion from the meac. So that's a pretty dang good resume that got them into the playoffs.  So let's take a look at 8 and 3 can any of these teams get in in 2015 bethan cookman was 9 and 2 and missed the playoffs and see Central was eight and three and missed the playoffs by 2016. We know that ncnc makes it in 2017. Nobody who was outside of the team's going to the Celebration Bowl was above seven and four in second place and below. So no playoff teams from the meac in 2018. No one was above seven and five in second place in below. So once again, none of the playoff teams came from the meac.  So for me personally, man, I think in 2019 at all lies on Ilan. I covered this a little bit in the past. But if NC A&T if they're eight and three and South Carolina state, you know, South Carolina state you also asked about them. They be Daddy to team. So that's going to hurt them for a playoff spot. I think they're going to have one less win if they're eating three because they really B 7 + 3 so the D2 winds going to knock them out. So I'm not going to count South Carolina state as a chance for a playoff team. Simply NC A&T if Elon is a really good team and that's on the  A along with Charleston Southern as another FCS win. I think they have a chance to get in there. So Village Terrier, you're going to hit me up disagree or agree man. I can't wait to discuss it on Twitter.  All right guys that concludes our podcast.

Today is Wednesday, August 28th, 2019 on this day in 1955. A 14 year old black boy was abducted from his bed by two white men beaten and murdered the teenagers brutal lynching was widely publicized and brought new life to the Civil Rights Movement galvanizing the Emmett Till.  generation  Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original every day. We tell a timely story from True Crime history then analyze the historical impact of that day's events. I'm Vanessa Richardson and today marks the anniversary of the brutal lynching of Emmett Till due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised. We advise Extreme Caution for  Children under 13 before we dive into the ramifications of one of the most shocking murders in the history of the American South. Let's go back to Chicago on the morning of August 28 1955.  The sun wasn't even up yet. Mamie till Mobley still clung to the edge of sleep. But once she realized the phone was ringing she sat upright alert. No one would call this early unless it was an emergency her son. Emmett was down in Mississippi visiting family. Something must have happened. Mamie said a fearful prayer before picking up the receiver her aunt wailed on the  Rend and confirmed Mamie's dread. They took him they took Emmett she told met me that Emmet and his second cousin had gone to the dime store a few nights before when they were leaving Emmett whistled at the white woman working behind the counter just a joke, but it scared her then in the early hours of the 28th. The woman's husband and brother showed up at the house.  With a gun demanding that Emmett come with them Mamie's Uncle tried to stop them offered them money, but they wanted blood that was hours ago. The uncle was still too scared to call the police Mamie barely heard the words that followed her ears were ringing. She felt like her heart could either explode or stopped entirely she'd told her son.  For the trip. How life in the South was years behind what he knew in Chicago Mississippi was still The World According to Jim Crow. She'd warned him taught him how to avoid trouble she'd warned him and still they had stolen her only son away from her most likely killed him for a whistle heartbroken and in shock.  Me waited for the call confirming what she already knew to be true in the meantime her uncle finally notified. The police officers questioned the two white men who abducted Emmett, but they claimed they let Emmett go after giving him a talking to still no one could find the teenager three days later. The phone rang again M. Its body was found in the Tallahatchie River.  He had been beaten past the point of recognition. They could only identify him by a ring inscribed with his initials. But Mamie couldn't let herself dissolve into grief. She had work to do she wasn't going to let her child's murder be covered up Mamie told her uncle to send Em its body home as is she needed to know exactly what happened to her, son.  When Mamie entered the mortuary to view the body the stench of death was worse than she expected. It did nothing to dampen the unimaginable site that waited for her. Her teenager was so brutalized one of his eyes gouged out one of his ears partially cut off the back of his head caved in it made me wonder why they even bothered shooting.  I'm through the temple. It was clearly a waste of a bullet. She knew that nothing. She said or wrote would ever be able to convey this senseless horror. She instructed the funeral director that Emmett's service would be open casket do not prettify him leave him just as he is Mamie told him firmly let the people see what they did to my boy.  That night Mamie slowly entered the funeral home supported on either arm by her father and her uncle a crowd of more than 10,000 people swarmed outside several of them journalists and photographers. They were here to serve witness now, Mamie took her final steps towards Emmet's open coffin the funeral director had been forced to place a pane of glass.  Over the body to contain the smell but if that was the only way the world would see so be it Mamie had pushed her grief down through all the organizing fueled by her anger determined to find some meaning in her son's death when she reached the coffin the reality of her loss flooded in her only son Gone Forever her baby boy.  Boy now a martyr Mamie fell to her knees and wept after this. We'll look at the long ranging ramifications of Emmett Till, 's murder now back to the story.  In the years since August 28th, 1955 Emmett Till's murder and funeral have been identified by many scholars as the spark that reignited the modern Civil Rights era in 1955 segregation and black oppression were still largely seen as a southern problem. The shocking photos of Emmet's open casket made the entire black community.  Petit pay attention as Mamie till Mobley intended the lynching of a 14 year old was everyone's problem North or South it was too horrible to ignore Jet Magazine a publication primarily marketed to Black readers was the main source of coverage on Emmett's murder funeral and the subsequent trial of his Killers Roy Bryant and JW Milam  Jets cover story on Emmett sold so many copies in the first week. They printed a reissue the magazine was instrumental in broadcasting the story to the country and the world the two jet journalists Moses Newson and Simeon Booker even helped track down a key witness for Bryant and my Lambs murder trial the witness testified that the men roughly questioned him the day before am it's  Asking for his whereabouts Bryant and Milam were spurred on by Bryant's wife Carolyn. She said Emmett was inappropriate with her when he came into the store where she worked as a cashier.  There is still debate about what exactly happened between Emmett and Carolyn she testified at trial that when they were alone in the store. He asked for two cents worth of bubblegum when she handed em at the candy. He closed his hand around hers squeezed it and asked how about a date baby Carol and yanked her hand away and tried to leave through the Gap in the counter but said that Emmett blocked her path and grabbed her waist she  Judge that he uttered obscenities and told her not to be scared of him because he dated white women before.  At that point Emmett's cousin Simeon right entered the store and saw the situation. He dragged Emmett back outside and Carolyn followed a few steps behind heading for her car to retrieve a gun from the trunk as Emmet and his cousin loaded into their own car to drive away. Carolyn said Emmet whistled at her but Simeon right disputed this account of events. He alleged Emmett was alone in the store with  Marilyn for less than a minute. He explained during that time. I don't know what he said. But when I was in there, he said nothing to her. She was behind the counter so he didn't put his arms around her and anything like that as she was going to her car. He did whistle at her. That's what scared her. So bad. The only thing that I saw him do was whistle.  Roy Bryant and JW Milam went on trial for murder in September of 1955 newspaper coverage described the proceedings as fairly informal members of the jury drank beer as they heard testimony over the course of five days after an hour of deliberation Bryant and Milam were found not guilty and released the verdict sparked outrage and  Tests in Mississippi and the south at large it galvanized a new wave of black activism to seek Justice and equality four months after em. It's funeral Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat launching the Montgomery Bus Boycott What followed was a Resurgence of peaceful protests marches and sit-ins Emmett's death was another reminder that the resistance did not need to Resort.  It to violence to effect change their oppressors would Supply the Bloodshed themselves voluntarily exposing their vitriol and racism for the world to see in her thesis paper on the impact of Emmett Till Death Rebecca Sherman of Salve Regina University described the police response to a peaceful protest in Alabama on May 3rd. 1963.  She wrote hoses and police dogs were turned on the demonstrators. As soon as they left the church the water hit with enough Force to rip bark off of trees. It knocked people down slammed them into curbs and over parked cars. The scene was described as a war zone.  Emmett's death particularly affected black teens and preteens of the mid-1950s. They saw themselves in Emmett. What happened to him could happen to any of them or their friends or their siblings as activist and author and Moody explained before Emmett Till's murder. I had known the fear of hunger hell and the devil, but now there was a new fear known to me the fear of being  Killed just because I was black this ushered in a wave of young black activism. That hadn't been seen previously civil rights activist Joyce Ladner described these young people as the Emmett Till generation. This generation came of age in the early 1960s and applied the lesson of Emmet's death to their cause activist. Cleveland sellers was 11 when Emmet died.  He remembered bringing the jet cover story to school to discuss with his classmates trying to make sense of it. They felt their own lives were at risk unless they did something to change the status quo. These conversations spurred sellers to later join the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the organization helped plan student-led sit-ins and had a hand in the 1963 March on Washington. Where dr.  Luther King Junior delivered his I Have a Dream speech in the process of gaining our rightful place.  We must not be guilty of wrongful Deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy thirst for Freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred in 2008 over 50 years after em, its death Carolyn Bryant recanted her statement about what happened that day in August of 1955. She told Timothy be Tyson author of the blood of Emmett.  He'll that Emmett didn't grab her waist or say anything obscene. She said quote you tell these stories for so long that they seem true. But that part is not true. Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him?  Thanks for listening to today in True Crime.

Today is Thursday, January 16th 2020 on this day in 1935. The FBI killed Outlaw Ma Barker in a four-hour shootout. Ma went down in history as a woman who loved her son's deeply so deeply it made her Public Enemy Number One.  Welcome to today in True Crime app are cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13 today. We're covering the deadly shootout between the FBI and wanted criminals Ma and Fred Barker. Let's go back to 5:30 a.m. On January 16th, 1935 on the shores of  a queer, Florida  15 federal agents surrounded the house approaching from three sides if the criminals wanted to escape they'd have to go by boat and if they went to the boat, they'd be in the sights of agent Earl Connelly leader of the operation the agents had over 1,500 rounds of ammo ample tear gas and the element of surprise and that still wasn't enough for FBI director J Edgar Hoover.  Over these Outlaws were leaders of the notorious Barker karpis gang responsible for two high-profile kidnappings, 10 murders and over a million dollars of larceny. And that was just in the past three years. The FBI had apprehended a few of the gangsters over the past month. But Hoover was convinced that Connolly's team had finally Tracked Down The Gangs real leaders, the dastardly pair were hiding out in the  Backwoods of Central Florida under assumed names spending their days hunting a three-legged Gator named old Joe. It was the tales of gangsters hunting old Joe that helped the feds track down the safe house as well as a map found in gangster doc Barker's Hideout, which conveniently had the location circled and now so did the FBI DEA agents moved in on the Florida house.  A well-kept to story with Lakeshore views, then they made their move Fred Barker come out. We are Department of Justice agents and we have the house surrounded no reply for all they knew the house was empty. They waited and waited growing sluggish in the Florida humidity after 15 minutes. The agents yelled another warning again. There was no answer.  Sir, no surrender not even a sign of three legged old Joe after one more warning. The men launched tear gas grenades at the windows. Finally a woman's voice called out. All right, go ahead.  On her command bullet scaled down from the upstairs Windows. These Outlaws would put up a fight. They were the new Bonnie and Clyde criminals in the spirit of John Dillinger and mad dog Underhill and they'd outlived them. All Fred Barker was a career criminal 33 years old typically seen with slicked-back hair light stubble and tired eyes at least in his mug shot Kate Barker.  was his mother she was a round-faced 61 year old with short black hair who favored dark lipstick and operating in the shadows and her sagging arms aimed a machine gun right at agent Connelly over the next three hours the FBI agents fired every bullet they had  Connolly's forehead broke out in sweat nerves or perhaps it was just the Florida heat all of his men were alive and unharmed but could they have been outlasted he had to order them to retreat to get more ammo from Jacksonville until he realized that no more gunfire was coming from the house either around 10:30 a.m. The agents strong-armed the local handyman Willie Woodbury.  To go into the house Woodbury was instructed to find out if Mama and Fred Barker were planning an ambush.  Willie nervously walked up the long wooden dock leading from Lake we're to the front door and through the door to the screened-in front porch. He passed walls pockmarked with bullet holes overturned chairs and torn paper sunshades. Somehow the fancy glass door to China cabinet was untouched but there was no sign of the barkers Willie plotted upstairs there he found  The mall and Fred by the windows dead guns littered the floor between them Fred was slumped in a chair surrounded by bandages and syringes his mother had clearly been tending to him caring for her son even in her own last moments as for Mama. It was unclear whether she'd taken one of the FBI's bullets or upon watching her child died before her eyes turned her own pistol.  On her heart either way, she would not be taken by her son's Killers Woodbury called down to the FBI. Once again Wanted Dead or Alive had resulted in death.  Up next we'll examine the crime spree that led J Edgar Hoover to call Ma Barker the most vicious dangerous and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade now back to the story.  On January 16th 1935 wanted criminal Ma Barker died in an FBI shootout and while she wasn't always called Ma Barker some would argue that she was always destined for a life of crime.  When Arizona Clark was eight Jesse James winked at her from there. Arizona's fate was sealed. She was entranced by the glamour of Gunslingers in the harsh Plains of the Wild West. She'd never quite be able to see crime as a bad thing at age 18 Arizona married and changed her name Barker to match her husband Kate to match her self-image though. She'd be  Be best known by the name. She took in 1893 Mah Mah and George Barker had four sons in short order Herman Lloyd Doc and Freddie. They were her world. They were also juvenile delinquents from their early teens, the burger boys were breaking and entering stealing cars and robbing their neighbors instead of putting her foot down, MA enabled her brood unwilling or unable.  To see her son's flaws. They were in and out of jail, but she did everything in her power to get them out and keep them free however theft and trespassing soon turned into kidnapping and murder in 1927. Herman Barker was caught committing a robbery and killed a police officer in an attempt to escape. However, the attempt was feudal Herman died by Suicide, too.  To avoid another stint in jail. This seems to have been the breaking point for George Barker who left mama in 1928 with no husband one son dead and the other three in jail mama had no way to support herself and was forced to turn to sex work.  When Fred got out in 1931 mall was hell-bent, her son would never see prison again, she joined him on the road as he returned to his life of crime. It was a codependency. Mom took care of Fred and Fred supported her financially when Arthur got out he did the same Lloyd remained in prison, but Ma hoped, he'd join them soon with Mod his side Freddy Barker joined up.  With Allen carpus forming the Barker karpis gang soon Ma Barker woman in her early 60s was following a gang of gun-slinging wild west Outlaws. They robbed banks. They robbed trains and in 1933. They kidnapped ham Brewing Dynasty Scion William a ham jr. And successfully ransomed him for $100,000 worth about 2 million.  dollars today  The next year they kidnapped Banker Edward George Bremer Junior for Twice The Ransom.  The kidnappings captivated the nation making the Barker karpis gang celebrities and FBI targets at one point the gangsters tried to disguise themselves with plastic surgery when the surgeon botched it they killed him Freddy Barker and Alan carpus were the obvious leaders of their eponymous gang, but the FBI thought ma might be the real criminal mastermind in December 1934.  Finally caught doc Barker rating his apartment among the evidence. They collected was a map to the house his mom and brother were hiding out in in short order. The FBI went to Florida surrounded the house and Shop the barkers to death according to their official reports. The FBI confiscated eight guns inside the lake. We are house and thousands of dollars in cash worth millions today.  Fred and Moss bodies were sent to the local Funeral Home word of their death spread fast sensationalised in the newspapers Ma Barker brains of gang reported killed with Fred Barker son in Furious Fray according to the local funeral director Harold Martin, there was extreme public interest in seeing the Outlaws corpses proof that even heroes could die. Ma Barker's body was on display.  At the funeral home for eight months and 15 days the original Central Florida tourist attraction whether she deserved this ghost treatment or not is Up For Debate Ma Barker spent her whole life surrounded by Outlaws watching them raising them supporting them. So was it so shocking she died like them was she destined to become a criminal from birth and was she even a criminal  After all, there's no evidence of Ma Barker planning or committing any of the Barker karpis gangs crimes, but there is evidence of J Edgar Hoover abusing his power to create smear campaigns and using disinformation to improve the image of the FBI Hoover spread the story that the gangsters mother was a criminal mastermind Hoover sent the agents in to capture an elderly woman dead or alive.  Declared Ma Barker Public Enemy Number One all the historical record can confirm is that Ma Barker loved her son's perhaps her circumstances weren't the criminal activity surrounding her but the stories told about her by the FBI by the newspapers and by the public eager for the next Outlaw to look up to in a hard hard time.

Hey bitch to piss white people are further. We nominate spice to voice Sebastian. It's time for to get a Kill.  terrible twosome tacky to so first of all  In fact, correct. Ya know what else? I don't know.  And this is another episode of TK T care. How's everything? How's how's how how family so, you know family get on your nerves? Oh, yeah, um, but that kind of eat like a fuckin family stuff and if I get on my damn nerves right heading and Raggedy as hell that's usual. But um, yeah my I mean we're getting to what what's going on with you me?  Well, I want to know about this.  In Petra's relief upon the world. It was I haven't heard a debut pop album that good since are you going to say the thing I might have but I got it.  Yeah sickening. Yeah, the groundwork for like it doesn't matter as long as you stay in a very perfect and - yeah, like how we talk about Beyond thing and like performing like people say like it's so basic and stuff like that, but it's there for cellular perfect. And the and the Precision is being there and like every note is where it needs to be and everyone places like perfect. It being really doesn't matter. Correct, correct?  Because we trying all the fun. We have no kind of range all of them and speaking of Rihanna demos. Um, this is my song of the week is ritual by Tiësto and Rita Ora. I like Rita Ora lat. I mean, it's no secret that she's very much, you know is a Rihanna demo singer and it's okay. It's okay. I love the song that's just pop and it's got a big hole that on her album know.  You know me Lawrence. Yeah, I know but I just want to make it clear. I was being funny about the Rihanna demos thing. Although some people can disagree. You know, I do like her and she's a sweet girl and she's beautiful make trying to be funny. I was though. Sometimes she of course does think that it was there's nothing wrong with that because a lot of girls get hits off Rihanna demos.  That's true too. Rihanna is distancia not here. Don't laugh not here. She is. She's like, we're not in the same. We're not talking about the tax bracket. We're not talking about.  Yeah, I mean as far as like people here may know of Rita Ora but like her home country. They know what they fuck. Yeah, and she sells so that's more or less where I was giving. I'm a Kylie fan. So I have absolutely nothing again. I just feel like Americans a lot of times 1/2 have bad taste the me that that's that is oh my God girl and to I really feel like there can only be one.  Be one of one type of right right, right. We have Rihanna. We don't need rid of really what and yeah. Yeah for and they grow.  That's cool. Isn't it? Like a little house phone? It's kind of house. I guess, you know, honestly if you want me to be honest, I've been leaning back towards and to house music a little bit more as of late. And I think it's because I'm really over trap the Trap. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the thing rituals not like what I mean granted. It's very pop and how see but like, I don't know it's refreshing to get like a big pop course. I think that's also why I love Kim.  To those big pop courses are like they feel good. You know. Yeah, she's very like Anthem like yes, and I look in front of you actually what I was thinking about, you know the song Sweet fire, right? Okay.  Album, but if I like you, but you know we gotta talk to you period yeah.  Yes at the end of it was nice little homage. Like the is he curated it? Perfect perfectly. I would not be shocked her mind if she wanted her mind. Yeah, I'm I believe it. She gives that thrilling. Yeah, she set out to you girl. Yeah, me too.  My mom hates when I hate it. What do you mean?  And I'm just I would love for there to be a time where we don't have to like announce it or like it doesn't have to be like this. But then also I you know, what? No fuck that. I think it's wonderful to announce. I think it's lovely to announce because I you know, I represent yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I like it. I just wish um, like a part of me kind of feels as though he sort of like waited till he got like where he wanted to be and he was well he got that good. Yeah, no wait. Yeah, I agree and um,  I have a lot of mixed feelings about it. I'm glad that it seems like a lot of people don't care but I also need we know are gonna tea. What do you mean correct? The black people, you know, even the strength I like, okay.  Anything but yeah, I wasn't expecting this outpour of support. I was expecting more of like a mixed reaction mix on the negative side. Okay. I feel like it's weird.  The thing is you have to play your cards. Right and I believe that he that he's gotten far enough to understand that because you know of the perfect example is like, you know, I don't even want to say he's a good example because I feel like there's there's been like a few gay people like  in the past few decades that have come and done it and it's hasn't necessarily been the being gay that fuck them up. It's people kind of pulling them various ways kind of like Adam Lambert. Gotcha. He first came out his debut album was good. She could shit. The image was T2.  He pulled down the gate though. Yeah kinda overshadow the music which I can understand but I feel like there's a way to go about what you want to say. Thank you pulled back. But that was I think like he really like kind of yanked it back a little bit and I feel like his career kind of stuff. It was like you gonna be going to be gay.  Yeah, I feel like if you do it, you got to be all in yeah, and not just like you have to be like a big old stereotype, but I feel like people can kind of tell when you're faking. Yeah and little knobs X gives me very genuine T. Yeah, he's just be happy to be here having a  Are you can kind of miss yourself? Yeah, he really just be going with the flows and like whatever you say can't say that that's the beauty. That's the beautiful thing though. I think we're so used to gain black boys not being confident, you know. Yeah and he's confident and very likeable. How do you feel about another thing that I don't like  About our community the gay community.  You like um, you should not be 30 something years old doing the motor mount that this person who was not able to drink. Yeah. It's very predatory. I know y'all don't want to you know talk about it because that's salty guys, but that's exactly and they love there she is.  For only support somebody or only give somebody their attention when they find them attractive and that's the truth. Exactly. He's not an ugly look not at all. He has wonderful features. Don't take my shit. You know that I don't find him.  Well, I don't know what the doc nobody saying sexual. Nobody's saying that you can't be hot because nobody nobody date somebody who could drink for know like since it's okay, please.  If you don't care about we and we love that you do not get us. No do not get us wrong. But not you. Yeah, I loved it loved it. You know, I love Laverne and for multiple reasons.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  I don't know.  You're drunk. Yeah, just Kiki and they caught them getting out of right, you know a car whatever so they were like God, right he doing with the girls. Do you have to have like Michelle Obama? It's crazy because the girls and the girls we have to act accordingly to what y'all want. But then when the mask boys get stupid.  You defend them.  Ain't nothing wrong with what Laverne said. She said a lot of these men in hip-hop are gay and they need to come out but I'm alive she knew of you owe her and he has okay better than the boys are.  Soli it's really representation needs to be there. And I don't know what I want. I don't know. I don't know what I wanted from Luverne. I don't know.  Yeah, but I see you kind of like they want certain people to Champion a certain way. Right and I feel like a lot of times its kind of similar to how I say the little knobs. It doesn't politicize himself. I don't feel like they're going to come up to him and ask him questions that all as Laverne because Laverne has politicized yourself. Yeah, it's bad. No, but she's created this perfect.  So then sometimes which is kind of gaggy because like black being black and trans is so like look down upon but like Laverne really took it and like curled. Yeah own thing and and she's just yeah, it's really great because I remember they did something similar to her. Um on I want to say, okay what the hell when they asked her about what was between her legs. I feel like didn't know know.  That was something that was that was some bullshit. You know, I was gonna say like she said she actually chose to not say too much. It was on Watch What Happens live with Andy Cohen? And I remember it was her there and I can't remember who the other guests was. But, you know at the end of the show, he gives like the Jack hole of the day and he gave it to  Mm. Ah, Amandla, okay for calling out Kylie for having like cornrows and she just like got in the comments and she was like and she tagged like a couple people. I was like, this is the perfect example of what I'm telling you about trying to take black culture and you know, yeah profit off of it without actually contributing anything to it gotcha and then of course house it was like girl go hang out.  Andy was like it's just hair looks like you could have chose anything else. Why did you choose this but they were there and he ended up but Laverne I think she made a very cute comment on why well, you know what does happen, but I really don't know enough about this. It ain't nothing wrong with saying you don't know.  Exhale just ask her. I don't think she was yeah, and then it was like going all right hear the music playing in the background.  works out well for him  For me what you don't like anemia. It's just not for me, but I'm happy for him. What else is not for me? The little not my Ariel hashtags because y'all don't stop and and that's something that we just let people to have red hair black people with red hair is written him representation this boy. He tweeted like yesterday.  Chloe and Haley are Hell. She's basically signed there beside to Beyonce's label. There's a twins they sing the theme song of grown an inch there on groaning - volt  Beautiful girls vocals down one of the twins Hale is or how he is going to be playing Ariel and you know, it's been a frenzy for the past since it was announced. Everybody was like, yeah, it's not like was it not an ounce on Fourth of July. I think it was like the third or the fourth. Okay, I went back and forth with with people on about this. Obviously I'm not doing but I just want  To just sit in there racism. That's like I like my racist racist like just saying. Hey, I don't want this nigger bitch being Ariel and then from there the end of discussion, but there's like this one eating who this idiot. He's like, oh, I just, you know arrows Danish and I don't have no problem with the black girl playing area but like Ariel's Danish bro, you know, she can't be can't be a black girl because like, you know, the original story. She's Dana's the original story. No shade area was a whore.  Let's keep it going the Beachside it right and Disney redid the whole thing. She's just this turned into like that. Beautiful Riley. All right, Lucky's like this beautiful, you know Lonesome girl who's just looking for love and you know, like cut it out y'all like she's a fucking fish. Yeah. It's a mermaid calm down and also stop trying to compare it to win.  Black people there will never be a black princess. They will know I mean, they're not be a white Princess Tiana because Princess Tiana work like yeah, it's but I feel like we also need to talk about this because yes me I was you know, how do I lay in my bed late at night? And I'd be smoking it just thinking about random shapes saying and it kind of pointed out to me that the smoke that we need. Wait. What did you say? I was like saying except the smoking part. I'm not really but um,  What would need to happen is we need more black representation? Yes, and we also and we need for some of that representation to not be rooted in being black. Yes, because think about it. The only reason why there hasn't been a situation where a white girl is going to play a black girl in a movie like that. Is it because if she ever yeah, it's always rooted.  In the Blackness. Yes, great. Not a problem more free. That's like more black girl. Like there could be a black.  Role play a princess. That's it. Because little the middle memory could be taken for any type of interpretation. It could have been a black girl could but a Spanish Fork of an Indian. It could have been any really don't matter. It definitely matters are feeling for some mermaid. She's her whiteness is not it's not like down lat I don't think anybody watch The Little Mermaid and thought about where she was from the bitches from under the sea and she talks to a crowd like she talks to a crowd for decline.  Out loud in the crab is spice. So like let's go.  I was good at you look good. No to be spice, but I'm just getting no but like literally there's so many different types of like the crab literally has a Caribbean accent like come on now like let's be real here. Like there's people that are dying Kimberly. Yeah, and then this boy he was like, I really love it because it's really cool that she's  black and then he came back and retweeted. It was like I changed my mind my three-year-old like niece or cousin or whatever was in tears because she's not gonna because she's a redhead and you get picked at for being a redhead and also first of all, I'm like 98% positive. They're gonna make her hair red. Yeah, of course and even if they don't I don't think we're not going to die here like Ariel is going to be just fine.  Picture everything's going to be okay. Everything is around.  V20 you got all your shit together period including me. Everybody's gonna be everybody's going to be one of the tethered from us this Halloween. They're going to put on them red. I haven't I still have walk on my hands. So I think you're not going to see it's really good to me. Oh wow.  Y'all leave her the fuck alone. That's it. Um, so are you ready to get into your team? Yeah, I'm excited. So I wanted to come on here. It's early but I'm tired. I'm tired of like sparing other people's feelings or what other people think about what I got going on. I've come to the realization this weekend that I am officially  we announcing myself as trans. I plan on transitioning into a female very soon. I'm I'm doing the research and everything like that because I want to just do everything the right way and it feels so good to say it out loud because all of my friends around me I think have really was tired. Yeah a mom with a boy.  GE is she like got the call that she was like for you here. I feel like my best friend has just been like girl. We waited like it's just been like we're waiting but we're gonna let you you know, you know, it was around I did I kind of realized I was like this bitch is a ho.  That in like the best way I know I just feel like so yeah, I'm currently like kind of researching everything and studying and kind of like watching YouTube videos and kind of not staying not assuring myself that I want to do this because it's something that I do want to do. I've come to terms with it and y'all for y'all wondering how I just decided this anyone who knows me knows I'm So Pro trans and I think it's because there's always been that part of me that knew that that's  Who I am but I've kind of like train myself to be like girl. That's too much. You know what I mean? Yeah, you can play all the time and I'd be like, okay, you're right. I trained myself to say girl. You're doing too much. But like from what I can remember like eat once I got out of high once. Okay, so I don't think I have a thing you end up here and everyone says that unless I'm going to work I do not wear pants and I literally say this I'd read mail call.  Cause I'd read it I don't like wearing anything male friendly mail. Like I don't subscribe to the male gender and anyone that's confused. It's simple as this and I don't mean this in the harshest way, but it's really I think I should do. Yeah, it really hurts and I'm learning to stop people don't have to like it and I'm not going to tell anybody to like it. I'm not going to push anything on anybody.  You know and I'm at a point where if you don't accept it, just get out of my life. You know what I mean? I don't know. Yeah, I don't have to justify who I'm gonna be or no. Fuck that who I am. I don't you know, I prefer the see pronouns and the her if you don't want to do that, that's fine. We don't have to really speak or grants it. If you're close to me. I'm going to share that information and then there's people that are listening to this so then whatever but you know, if it's something you're not comfortable as it has nothing.  Do with your comfortability because that's nothing to do with you. You know, like I think I've been so conditioned to just think about what everyone else has to say to where it's coming to that point where I'm comfortable enough to own it that I'm trans woman and I'm going to get where I want to be with my transition to the point where I need to stop. I need to start being selfish and I need to start being put me first right I need  But I'm feeling a lot of like.  This year with pride was different. Like I feel like this year's pride month was really different this year period I've just been through a lot of stuff and I think I was telling myself like when I got drunk and I said it and I blurted it out. It was kind of just like I'm kind of tired of like, oh you just let it out while we were talking I was talking about  It's about because there's a lot of things that I want to do that I'm like that I was saying I'm nervous about whether it's my parents and getting a new job. I was saying how like, I'm nervous about like like how I look and getting a new job. It's so hard to get a job. That's why I think I've stayed so stank stagnant at this one. And then I said how like because I don't like subscribing to the male gender. I don't relate to men I and I went on on that. I was like  don't really two men. I don't don't subscribe to the gender. I don't want to be considered a male. I'm trans and that's when I just like was like, oh my God, I actually said it and I paused and I was like that felt good to say but I also didn't want to say it and take it back. So but I just kept talking and I was like, but I know it but I've been conditioned to train myself to say and  I've heard what other people have to say about it. I was like no but really I feel well no, you know what? I'm not no say it. No. No because we're gonna we're gonna just be because he was saying you've seen how people like talk about trans people but it was kind of my privilege was about to jump out my sister in the privilege. Is it what was it? What were you going to say? It's okay.  Fragile mentally because I've been through so much stuff. Where an algae BT. Yeah. We're very fragile mentally put on this front girl, but mentally it's a fucking battle every single day. And and I think for the first time and I'm going to say this for the first time I am feeling so like  Like what's the word? I'm feeling so not overwhelmed because that's like saying that it's too much. I feel excited excited. Yeah, I feel weight off of my shoulders as I finally said it out loud, but I do want to be a woman. I want to pursue. Yes that road. I've been watching YouTube videos and I've been like asking my fellow transistor questions about it. I asked you want to start  Wanted to get a sports bra very soon. I'm actually going to probably do that. Like all my God. Yeah. Yeah, I do.  Are you just gonna be like he is my training bra. Are you gonna ask me something? I don't know yet.  I don't know. I don't think I want to like I don't think you know what whenever I want to put some mini Toki something in it. You know what you're not lying and perhaps maybe I think you can buy like maybe like, you know, this is crazy because this podcast yeah.  I'm gonna do it correctly now, like I've been researching like centers to like go and talk because I know you need to talk to somebody before you actually start like that. I feel yes the hormones and stuff like that. But I'm gonna do it. I'm excited. I'm very excited because for one time in my life, I feel like I'm finally tuning out the noise that's around me and  Going full force and I told myself moving the ball forward. I'm gonna do that because I just hold myself back too much and I I've seen it happen and I and and there's no reason for it because you only you did you only got one life and it's cheesy, but it's the fucking truth. But yeah II prefer know it really is. Yeah. I prefer female pronouns now, like I said,  Said I do have a name. I'm not sharing again until like I get where right now I'm giving you very much starter pack. I hate saying that but I am giving I'm gonna give you that and I you know the name but are you going to change it if that's the case? Are you still are you like feeling solid on it? Yeah. Well, you just take yourself for a test drive. No. No, I'm solid on it. Okay. Yeah, I'm solid because I can't think of anything else that clicks for me.  Yeah, I'm off. Yeah, I'm also like it's just something that I know that I've been wanting to do. But I've been like pushing it away pushing it away pushing it away pushing it away pushing it away because like I said, I've been conditioned to say okay, that's a little extra like you could do the whole like wearing the clothes thing, but then I really sat and told myself like girl you don't like nothing that boys do.  You literally just have the genitalia like you I don't like we're like I like and it's like and everyone who knows me knows it's a parent.  Switching it up. Right right you exactly I never switched it up never turn it up never. It's a solid it's a solid thing like a lot of the girls out here. Y'all switch it up. Y'all like to be funny, but you're also like to throw your little touch in the there. I've never switched it up. I've been the same girl for years now. So I feel like it's just time to be honest with myself and take it to that level that I know I want to take it and I know  No, it needs to go but I'm excited. Yeah, I'm gonna get a sports bra. I'm gonna definitely do my makeup way more often. I'm really just going to do what the fuck I know I want to do and I tell a psych myself out about it all the time and it has to stop it's not fair to me. It's not fair to me. I might be a lot of people ask me because I speak about you know, the relationship I have with my parents and again for the first time.  For y'all I'm gonna just put them on the back burner. And yeah when I'm ready to disclose that with them I was with them I will disclose it with them. Do I see them as often as no, I don't see them that much in case anyone's asking so I can do yeah, I was gonna say like girl they're gonna know. Yeah, I can do what I want to do and I plan on telling them when I actually start taking the hormones and things like  Like that and think starts showing because I don't want you know, right I don't want it to come off like it's something that's just I just jumped out to get even though my mom will probably not that I think it'll just be like whoa, like this is real but it can't be a shock to anybody like anyone who knows me can not sit here and listen to this and say they're surprised nobody. Nobody nobody. Even I'm gonna I know what's your story to tell but I told my mom, okay, and that's fine. I'm not ashamed.  Of it. You already know how my mom is right? Because I get it. Listen. I'm also in a new I think with announcing this to myself. I've have a I have a different state of mind where I don't need to force nothing on anyone as long as I feel how I feel that's my own reality. Is that of a woman and yeah,  he's going to be able to know no matter what pronouns they use exactly how I look and feel or how I because even when I wear makeup, it's like I'm envisioning a woman in my head and I told myself that like what I'm wearing makeup not every gay person feels that way and fucked. I mean, I'm not whatever not every person feels that way but for me to Tea yes as a trans girly for me when I wear makeup, I'm in  Shooting a woman a lot of y'all wear it to be pretty and whatever the cases I'm envisioning a woman in my head. I've been doing it. I've noticed it. I've realized that I'm just coming to terms with it. And yeah, that's it feels good to talk about it here and I'm gonna definitely and for my own like Solitude and salt like for myself, I actually I was going to actually like put a post on Instagram like a story and just kind of like talk about it because I just want to like I said when it's when you have  in a message that like you've kind of been sitting on for a long time and you finally get to be open about it. It feels good. Like I always usually rag on people on social media who kind of like put their business out there, but I see why because it's a form of therapy and it's like some cheap thought sucking keep no stop. Yeah. I got it.  Vince yeah, and it's not because I'm sure the girls nipples be hurt but I'm ready for that bitch. You are about to go through puberty all over again. Yeah. Yeah. I'm ready for it. It's okay.  for as long as I remember when my dad was like to play basketball and I just wanted to be one of the girls like and and again I know but a lot of people felt that way but I  Literally wanted to be one of the girls. It wasn't like a situation where like no you want to hang out with them. You wanted to like be that wanted to trade clothes. Yes. Yeah, and I knew it wasn't socially okay to do it. So I reverted back to that. Okay, you're like, it's too much, you know, but like like I said, my mom cannot like nobody can sit there and say that no one saw this coming like my parents would go in my room and see my clothes that I would wear out to the club and I would lie and say oh that was my  Friends cause you know, she kept them. They're not my little girl from like my friend, you know, I was like, oh she just left her clothes here because my parents didn't want that nowhere. Yeah, and my mom was like, but they but they're like your sizes and stuff.  Like so yeah y'all. That's my story right now and I'm going to definitely keep y'all updated and talk about it. I'm gonna walk. Oh, yeah. I'm totally going to Vlog about it. It's going to be so not know actually. No, it's not going to be directly. I'm actually really excited to do it.  I think it's something I've been missing. I think that's kind of where I really just want to say like I feel like I've been modifying myself because in my head I have a vision of where the gate is closed to it. Yes. Well without touching it lucky gasps. Yes, and I think I've just everything is starting to make sense to me from the piercings to like my hands is everything everything is making sense. Like I literally like you said, I've been trying to modify without female but  What was that stuff? That's what she was going for ya.  Yeah, that's the long. Yeah, I mean, I totally understand and I totally really I remember one time. I was maybe like 4 or 5 in um, I was staying the night like my God mom's house and I was laying there in her bed. We used to I used to sleep in the bed with her and it was late at night and I was like sometimes I want to be a girl right I remember.  Cause a Ruckus and I'm not even going to sit here and say like even to this day sometimes I feel like girl you're a girl.  I feel like Loki. I might just be a drag queen like I like to see.  And I think at this point I'm surely going to vlog.  About it. I am happy that I've gotten such great support from people that I care about meaning again. If I don't care about you, I really don't give a fuck what you have to say about it shutting out things and people who don't do any good for me in my life. So I mean, yeah, yeah.  Yeah with people and their bullshit exactly. So yeah, that's just that's my journey starts here and I'm very very very excited. And yeah, I hope there's a young teen, you know, who takes it and understands that whole hardly again. It's so corny to say but none of us are alone. We're Never Alone. We think we are and  I think I thought I was because I never spoke about it. And when now that I spoke about I see the outpour of like support that people generally have a bitch we've been trying to put the clock to feel like their time and I think you know, it's like thing with the time thing. I think I was at that point where it's like bitch. What else? Can you fucking do? You're a fucking girl like something is not something's not clicking here and it's like it's because I haven't take took.  It where it needs to go. So I'm so happy. Stop licking the fucking ice cream. I'm sorry. I'm on Twitter. And this old ass he has grown. I'll go to jail, but it's okay.  I'm so happy that I got to come to this realize I don't think I haven't I've been this content with like myself in a minute.

episode 44 getting yourself out of victim mentality  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dream. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious and insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self awareness along the way.  Hello ladies, welcome back. Those of you who have just celebrated the holidays. I hope you had meaningful experience. I hope it went well. I hope your in-laws didn't drive you crazy. You didn't yell at your husband when you are cranky and hungry. And if you did, that's great, too. It's all great.  Thinking about this new year. I was looking through some of the requests that I received for topics that people wanted covered in the podcast and I thought even though I know not everybody listening did just celebrate Rosh Hashanah. That's cool. We can go with this. Anyway, I wanted to find something that I felt like what's going to give us the biggest room for growth? What is the one tool out of everything you guys were asking for that? I felt like had the most potential to kind of take you from where you are.  Are in a place where you might be feeling stuck to really that next level that new place of breakthrough. The question that popped out to me was one that someone sent in which was how do I get out of victim mentality. Now? First of all, I was so impressed when that question came in in the first place because it takes already a certain amount of self-awareness to even realize and be willing to admit that you're in victim mentality, right? Well done already, but I also felt like this is one that applies.  Eyes to all of us, right we all have some area of our life. If not multiple areas of our life where we really see ourselves as a victim the thing about being a victim is that when we see ourselves as the victim by definition we are powerless. Okay. So if I'm a victim to my circumstances and my relationship or in my with one of my extended family members or in my ability to earn money or save money or be responsible with money if I'm a victim when it comes to my self-control around  If I'm a victim when it comes to my ability to find the right kind of exercise program that makes me feel good. Whatever. The thing is that we victimize ourselves we're doing is we're kind of giving ourselves like an easy out. I don't have the self-control to get off of social media. So even though it's not good for me right now. I just something I can do. I'm a victim you hear what I'm saying? So I thought this is a perfect topic to address starting out the year. So I'm going to give you seven steps to get  elf out of victim mentality you guys ready?  Before we get started though. I do want to just remind anybody November 10th is the first class. It's a call in class for the kala cohort. This is a specific run of the first year married program. I don't know if we're ever going to be doing this again. So if you're at all on the fence, you need to either send me a message or just go ahead and sign up because I don't know if it's going to happen again and it's going to be awesome and we already have some scientists coming in which is really exciting. So the caller cohort is the first year.  Mary program custom-tailored to women in the Orthodox Jewish community. So I have women who are engaged all the way through more than 10 years married and I am so excited to be working with all of you. I'm hoping it's not going to get too too big. I think we have like right now A nice-looking amount. We could probably fit in a couple more people because I really do want to be able to give all of you a lot of attention. The course is designed for you to be able to walk away having mastered this material knowing how to coach yourself.  Of its structured sequentially from where you need to start to where you need to go to have a complete transformation all the material that is the most powerful for my clients that I found myself repeating over and over and over to each client because it was what they needed to hear and it was what was helping them so much and it was what they had never heard before boiled down into one class because if I'm about anything it's systems and efficiency, and I just couldn't stand.  And to have people paying me that much money to hear it one on one when they could pay me much less money and here in a group, but everyone who goes to the course is going to be getting a 30 minute session with me. So already like you're going to get that individual customized attention.

The sign up is first year. Mary.com forward slash colic aall. Aah.  If you're listening to this and you're feeling a little left out because this doesn't apply to you. Please reach out to me. I absolutely love doing cohorts. They are such a blast and I would love to do one that fits you. So reach out to me. You can get me an Instagram at first you're married or just email me at Kayla at first you marry.com.  Okay, so let's dive into this. I need to start with an important caveat whenever we're talking about victim relationships anything like this because I do get a lot of questions about how this material Works in unhealthy or abusive relationships. This is a really tricky topic. But what I generally say is that if it's a relationship where you suspect any kind of abuse whether it's physical whether it's emotional whether it's a verb any kind of abuse if there's some kind of power play going on or you feel like the other  Is not invested in the relationship. I don't mean he's just frustrated and it's been a couple weeks and he's been cranky and distant. I mean there's a major clear power play or people have reached out to you that they're concerned about it. It's always a good idea to speak to a qualified therapist. If you Google gottman therapists G OT TMA n therapists, you will find a resource page a directory for couples therapist that are certified.  In gottman therapy, which is one that I highly recommend. I'm hoping to have somebody on to speak about this in more detail, but it's important to understand that if we're learning material about how to improve our relationships male-female Dynamics. So in many dysfunctional relationships that material can actually be helpful, but there are some dysfunctional relationship. So that material can be very dangerous because it's used in a way to try and fix  An abusive relationship or try and change someone who's really not mentally able to do that. I wouldn't God forbid ever want somebody to use this material to get themselves more into an unhealthy relationship. So don't hesitate to reach out if you're not sure if you want to reach out to me and you need someone to just sort of be there with you as you're figuring it out, please do I just gave my contact information a second ago.  So what we're talking about today are normal people. What do I mean by that? I mean that we have our highs and we have our loads we go through phases. I've been married for 10 years. I imagine myself married at 20 when you're married for one year. It's hard to imagine that someone could look back and be like, oh, wow. That was a really hard year for our marriage, right? But when you married for 20 years like that's possible when you're married for 50 years could be even more than a year. Right? We have our highs and our lows as individuals and as a couple so  What we're talking about and this is going to extend to more than just the specific marriage relationship. We all fall into victim mentality sometimes whether it's a story about our relationship or abilities at work or with their physical health or our self disciplined. So here we're going to launch into the 7 tips, but I want to give you to help you with victim mentality ready tip. Number one identify the feeling when you're in victim mentality. Hopefully you're already at a point where you can at least retroactively notice it, you know, your flag is going to  E up now because you just listen to this podcast. So you're already on the right track, but knowing the feeling viscerally is going to help you red flag it for the future, right? If you really know how it feels in your body then even without knowing. Oh, I'm in a story about victim mentality. You'll be like Oh, I'm doing that thing where I'm feeling really cranky intense and oh, that's how I feel when I'm doing the victim think am I doing the victim thing right now and then you'll start questioning your thoughts you hear me? So how does it feel in your body or what are  Our habitual thoughts right? We tend to have lines in our heads like this always happens to me or I always mess that up or I'm all right and always or I should have or he never write anything like that will have sort of like a line that our brain likes to feed us that's like very comfortable. It's like her security blanket, right? So if you can identify those habitual thoughts that's another really good way to identify the feeling the next one is what's the story sometimes our victim mentality comes from one big story.  One big story that we've been attached to for a while, right? So let's say it's I'm just not the happily-ever-after type things just don't work out for me like that. Okay. So anything we're going to guess that one more but anything that has a story like that is optional. You got me. Okay, if you want to talk to your girlfriend's about why your story's true and you guys can sit around and drink wine and eat chocolate and Ben and Jerry's and cry about it then go for it. But if you want to talk to me, I'm going to tell you your story is optional.  Because it's actually nicer. I don't want you stuck in it tool number two is going to be beware of boundaries that you're setting to control often times when we're in victim mentality. What we try to do is control what's happening outside of us because that's understandable right meaning something's happening to me. I don't like what's happening to me. So I'm going to tell you my boundaries so my boundaries might be like, you can't talk to me or my  A child or my husband like that. All right, here's how you know if you're in victim mentality because you come back afterwards and you're like I told them my boundaries and they didn't listen and then you're like spinning right? What do I do and instead stronger boundaries? Right? I need to tell them again. I need to have all my friends tell me how inappropriate that was, right. I need to come up with some kind of diagnosis for this person. They're clearly a narcissist right when a brother.  I'm not saying no one's an artist has but we also do that sometimes right. So here's the thing if you're feeling frustrated that you set a boundary and it wasn't followed. You didn't set a boundary that's not called a boundary. Okay, and if you want to look into Brooke Castillo, she talks extensively about this, but I'll give you the summary right here.  What you did is you told someone what to do and they didn't listen to you. Okay, any time we tell someone what to do they might do it, and they might not  Fact of life. Okay a boundary is when I tell them that if they do something I will have to do the other thing you do X I do why you curse in front of my two-year-old. I'll be leaving with my two-year-old. Yeah, you drink too much on our date. I will get a cab home. Okay, so a boundary is if you do this, I'll do this. You're never spinning out of control if you have a boundary.  It's that like that because you know what you're going to do. It's not reliant on the other person. Okay, so that's going to get you straight out of victim mode victim mode is I need them to change their behavior. So I'm going to tell them rules boundaries are I got me covered. I'm going to take care of myself. I'll be fine. This person might do something. I don't like I'm going to do what I need to do to take care of myself, and I'm not going to be frustrated or upset because they shouldn't be that way.  Way they're going to just be whatever way they're going to be and I'm going to be okay.  Right and you guys can totally do this. You really can.  However, that person is being is exactly how they should be.  Tool number 3 articulate the thought are you guys getting used to me saying this yet? I think this is becoming like one of my catchphrases. I think it's come up and pretty much every podcast episode articulate the thought we articulate. I mean it needs to be an actual words. You can't question a thought if you haven't articulated it. Okay. So if you're like, oh I've got this thing about me and guys  I can't do anything with that. Right? You can't do anything with that find out what your story is. If it's I'm not the happily-ever-after type. Nothing good ever happens to me. I want you to write it down and look at it. And then here's the thing.  Don't try and change it yet. Don't be in a big rush to make it go away.  Just look at it. Feel it be with it acknowledge where it's been in your brain. This is like a really, you know, they say like the neural Pathways that we use over and over like super highways, right?  They just the cars just go straight down so easy. It's so fast.  There's no traffic on these ones. Yeah, so you've been having this thought a long time just like notice that that that's been happening that's been coming up. So automatically it's not even a conscious decision anymore just happens.  And so what we tend to do is we have articulate the thought and then we immediately try to jump to another thought really fast because this one's really uncomfortable. Yeah, or we're starting to realize that this one's doing bad things for us. It's creating bad results in our life, but I really want to urge you not to be in a rush. We don't have to run away from it because it's only a sentence that were thinking that's all it is.  There's nothing urgent. It's just thoughts and feelings.  Tip number four is I want you to start noticing the results of your thought. So here's where we want to focus on the present instead of which is really normal and natural to go past focused. Okay, what we want to do is be like, oh happily ever after. Well, of course, I feel that way the first guy that I've ever dated. This is how it ended up and this is what happened with my parents and this is how you know, I thought that I was going to be the captain of the team and I lost it in the last moment and look at all this proof I have  Have that I'm just not the happily ever after type things. Just don't work out for me. That's what we want to do. We want to go back to all of our evidence of why it's true and it feels productive, right? It feels like if we go back there, we're going to sort of uncover the truth of where it comes from. But all we're really doing is we're walking those Pathways over and over again.  We're reinforcing the original thought so unless you're doing it in a really careful way. You could really fall into this trap of like look how true this is because look at my history. So I know it's very interesting. It's very compelling to question where your story came from you first sure have lots of reasons of why your story's true.  But right now what I want you to do is stay in the present and look at what the thought is doing.  So that means how is it making you feel?  I'm like really take some time with that.  What kinds of things are you capable of because you have this thought?  And what kinds of things are you not capable of because you have this thought.  So just spend some time getting to know it getting to know the results of it getting to know the effect of it in your life.  Could take some time on that.  And that's really the next tip tip number five, which is to live with your thought. She probably saying steps. These are like Steps not tips. I'm switching from now on it's Steps step number five live with your thought. So now that you've gone scientific and cerebral right? You've articulated it and you're noticing it now. I want you to go do some field research how that's how this is playing out for you because you're going to gather a little bit from right now. Okay in the last week or two I see when I had that thought how it worked out, but I want you to now move.  Forward knowing that thought in your head and then watch it in action. Okay. So when you see this thought show up and you identify how it's making you feel and what you're doing when you have that thought and what it's getting you in your life. So you should write it down or what is often a really good shortcut send a voice memo and I would say send a voice memo to your podcast buddy. Some of you guys have pod.  Cast buddies for this podcast and that's so awesome. If you don't have one just go get one to share this episode and then you've got a podcast buddy and then you can send your voice memos to each other about when your thought is coming up. Okay. Step number six is now this is the part you were waiting for you get to start to Jiggle It Loose. Okay. So here are some questions you want to ask yourself. How is the opposite of my story also true? So for instance, how do I always get happily ever after?  So I just experienced this I was going into the holidays and with all the thoughts and feelings and emotions of going into the days of repentance and self-analysis and wanting to grow and hoping to be leaving behind any of our negative traits vary like intense couple days, which is a wonderful thing. I was feeling very low about everything that had happened with my health and the previous year those of you who've been following the podcast. No, but I develop type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune condition over.  Last year and spent a lot of time feeling really horrible. And at this point now I'm going to be insulin-dependent for the rest of my life barring any medical or otherworldly Miracles. So I'm sitting there thinking I really got beat up this year right this last year. I really was put through the ringer. So what's going to be next year, right? So it's feeling like really like nervous and unmotivated didn't want to connect.  But then I realized that the opposite of that story was equally true.  Right and so I can give you my example and it's not going to be the same as your example, but then when I when I looked at the opposite, so I feel like I've been through the ringer but then I was like but also, how was this the best year ever? So not only did I have reasons that this was the best year ever but I also had two reasons that this particular challenge this particular diagnosis was actually also a blessing did also make things happen in our life that we had dreamed of for years.  Years and years like moving to Israel, right? So  Yours isn't necessarily going to translate as quickly, but often it will often when you have the thought and then you just want to look at it from the other side. You're going to see not that now. I'm just deluding myself right? I'm not just saying. Oh that thoughts on comfortable. Let me go have this squeaky clean thought that's why I like it really nervous when people are trying to do like mantras and you know Law of Attraction stuff because they're not paying attention first to what's going on in their brain. They're just trying to replace it with other stuff. So I feel like it's like it's  Taking a really weak foundation and then building like one of those Hollywood houses that they use in scenes where it's like all cardboard, you know, and there's no there's no rooms. It's just the front of the house. You guys know what I'm talking about. I spent a lot of time at MGM as a kid because I'm from Orlando, but you know what? I mean like those those like fake houses that look like houses from the outside, but there's nothing inside over like a really weak Foundation. That's kind of how I feel like what's happening. They're building these massive houses on no Foundation because instead of looking into what's actually going on in their brain and realizing  That everything that's happening is just because of a thought and the thought is just words. It's just a sentence in your head and that that makes it optional.  Right, and then I just try and immediately like adopted ones that feel better or feel more powerful or feel more like they're going to make me a lot of money or whatever it is. So I'm building on a very weak foundation. So what we're doing is we're starting by jingling at loose right? We're asking how the opposite is also true. Why because you need to see the truth in the fact that it is only a thought.  Right not because I want you to jump to the new Happy Mantra, but because you need to see that it's only a thought.  After this experience going into the holiday. They realized that I could totally see this as having gone through the ringer last year and I can totally see this as one of the biggest blessings of my life and they're equally true which makes them optional. Neither one is make-believe. Neither one is fantasy. They're just both thoughts. And so then what I what I generally want to do is then say, okay. So my goal is to be this this this idea this I this this image I have  Of my values and who I want to be and how I want to show up in the world and how I want to contribute to the world. So which one of these is going to help me and honestly, sometimes it might be the other one. Sometimes it might be the negative one. Sometimes I might want to be able to say set to someone else I get where you're coming from. I know what it means to feel beaten up.  I know what it means to not get Wai something could happen to you. Right but a lot of the times it's going to for me. It's going to be a practicing gratitude of the other of the positive thought.  Alright, so then when you've jiggled those thoughts looks right when you've gone through them when you really identify them when you started to play with them and see how they're showing up in your life.  If you really gotten their sober some of you I know you've been really working this material and you've been listening regularly and you've been listening from the beginning and you really are are applying it to your life.  So you can try this and don't be frustrated if it doesn't work because this is advanced stuff.  Is go all out go playful and pick a new amazing thought doesn't have to be replaced. This one. Just pick some new thought that try it on because if you really get to the place of realizing how arbitrary our thoughts are. Then you can do this, then you can do this game of like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. Right the only reason that when I first got my diagnosis, I wasn't completely  Crushed by it was because I was in the middle of a very intensive cohort of first-year married, which means I was doing the coaching consistently, right? And so I had so much mental Clarity on how my thoughts were affecting me and I had so much of a power of play of being able to put in new thoughts because I had done the initial foundational work of seeing how my thoughts are affecting me.  Those are steps guys seven steps. I noticed some of you I don't know if this feels more like review. I hope not. I hope this is going to help you really take this material and apply it more.  I think we like to grab onto catchphrases and I think the phrase victim mentality really is one of those catch phrases and I want to always encourage you to be a little skeptical be a little suspicious of phrases like that because once we name it something then it sort of has this like it's in bold print, you know, it's it's important and serious. Right? So I'm taking victim mentality and trying  Get down for you into really truthfully the basic thought work. We all go there.  And sometimes we're more caught up in a certain story, which does Place Us in the role of the victim in a certain area of our life. Right? Like I said, like you might it might be coming up a lot in your marriage or maybe coming up a lot when it comes to overeating or you might be coming up a lot somewhere else in your life. But ultimately what it means is if you're going through these seven steps identify the feeling watch out for boundaries that you're setting to control. So make sure you're doing boundaries properly articulate the thought notice the results of your thought.  live with your thought  jiggle the thought loose and then if you want move on to the advanced skill of go all out and pick a brand-new amazing thought then we can take this big sort of scary concept of victim mentality and boil it down to something that's very actionable very practical and mostly very normal. It's so normal right? Sometimes we think things are normal. They're like, we're paralyzed it's so normal. So I hope these tools are powerful and helpful.  You again those of you who want to take this work further and you fit this profile Orthodox Jewish you want to go and do the collar cohort? I would love to have you you want to join the first year married program. That's not your cohort. You can either reach out to me. We can put a cohort together, or you can join into the Evergreen first-year married program, which is online all the time at first you're married.com. I would love to see you in there. I would love to work with you either way, and thank you so much for tuning in this week. I will talk to you again.  Next week. Bye. Bye.
Welcome to the Chinese medicine.  With your host Marie Hawkinson Chinese medicine practitioner. Hi, welcome to the Chinese medicine podcast. I'm very Hopkinson. I'm a Chinese medicine practitioner. And today we're going to be talking about headaches and the pain that had to alleviate the pain that you might get from a headache. So you've probably done this before when you've gotten the headache maybe press your temples with one like that. So people sort of line one like going like that on the desk because they're they're in pain and our Natural Instinct. Sometimes is to actually press where the pain is.  Press those pressure points. So you can see that I'm here in lovely. Beautiful Melbourne yarra river is behind me. It's beautiful city. It's a bit cold outside. So I'm glad to be nice and cozy warm inside but let's get on with it today. So pain in our head or headache pain, how can we alleviate that pain with acupressure now? What's acupressure? It's pressing the points pressing the acupuncture points. So this is the main point you might have seen being used before. This is called her gu large intestine 4  So her ghost was the pinion the Chinese name of the point and that point is on along the second metacarpal, which is your second finger. And if you feel that you've got a little bone here and just kind of press in that sort of squishy space you or you can use the thumb and your first finger like that and pressing in like that. So you using the pressure of your finger under your hands to sort of push up a little bit and the finger the thumb then to press down into the point now the trick with  This point a lot of people say it's between the two fingers. It's more on it's the channel is on the large intestine Channel, which is on along the finger side not on the thumb side. So you need to have it needs to be kind of more here not here not in the web of the finger now with all acupressure. What you should feel is like a tingly a heavy and a key sort of Sensation from pressing the points. Now if you've ever had acupuncture, which is like needling the points it  the acupressure should replicate that same kind of feeling so you should have a similar feeling to acupuncture with acupressure. Now for headaches were pain in the head. Sometimes you can just naturally find you that you feel relief by just pressing the pressure points. You might have had like an Indian head massage or some some different kinds of massages where they press on your head scalp acupuncture is like to acupuncture points on the scalp. That's also utilizing the many many many pressure points that are on your head now.  You can't press the points too hard in terms of like what would what would be the worst thing that would happen? When you press the points too hard. Well, you get a bruise on that area. And before you got the bruise, it will probably feel uncomfortable. So you usually stop the person would often stop pressing if you get a bruise in that area, then once the bruise goes away, there's usually nothing else that's damaged there unless you I mean, this is just when you simply pressing the points with your own pressure, then that's you know, that's it's nothing.  You can kind of help you can't do too much damage to yourself. So you can press away. If you press the wrong spot you not going to you know, put your body out of balance. Let's say by just pressing the wrong point when you're trying to trying to do this. So it's worthwhile just to give it a go give it a try and see if you can alleviate the pain of your headache before you need to go and take painkillers. So acupressure works the best it's the most effective for when you like the suit of the headache starts to start the acupressure.  Rather than waiting until it's like a throbbing intense headache or you know, it's so it's so bad. You may need more than just acupressure to stop it if it's been going on for a long long time and it with everything with everything on my channel. I always tell people like don't use YouTube as a replacement for medicine. So if you have a headache there can be lots of reasons why you have headaches headaches can come because you're dehydrated they can come because of caffeine withdrawal you can cut this lots of reasons and if you want to know the reasons in Chinese medicine, I've got another  Video on that so you can also put the link to that below you can check that out. But also headaches can be signs of serious health problems in our body like so serious problems. You could have a brain aneurysm you could have lots of different problems in your body and you won't know that the diagnosis unless you go towards a medical practitioner like so an actual GP your medical doctor and when you go to a Chinese medicine doctor and they may refer you to a western medicine doctor. That's the reason why because they don't know they don't have the ability to  Give you an MRI scan or whatever is needed to make the diagnosis. So if you're not sure go and see practitioner control why you've got the headache or if your headache persists and you're not and it's not being alleviated, even with with your standards kind of painkillers and things like that. Then that would be a time when you go to a medical professional and get a diagnosis now acupuncture can also be used to relieve headache and there's lots of evidence documenting the treatment of headaches with a  Poncho you can occupy Chinese medicine practitioners can treat the pain of the headache at the time. Now, there's lots of different ways. They may go about that. Sometimes they may put some needles in your head. Excuse me. They may put some news in your head. They may put some acupuncture points in your body your hands feet legs arms. That kind of thing. Sometimes acupuncture acupuncture is used along the neck and the back like the upper back to alleviate that tightness and then free up the  The flow of blood to the head because that's often the cause of many headaches is just musculoskeletal tightness, but we're mostly focusing on what you can do for your own self today in treating headaches. So you've got pain in your head. You can basically just palpate your head and I suggest you do this technique where you put your fingers in it on your scalp somewhere and you basically just move back and forth and you can see with my as I'm moving my hair lines moving back and forward, that's because we have our skull  And then we have the skin that's on top of that and the hair coming out of our skin. And so you'll see that as I'm doing that I'm actually moving the skin is kind of moving being manipulated over the bones. Now your skull bones can move a tiny bit. You won't feel the move by doing this but it's your skull isn't one big bone. It's lots of bones that have basically fuse together like this and this is where you're going to do like a cranial if you see a crane  No sacral therapist they often do treatment where they're they're slightly even chiropractors are slightly manipulating those bones or just affecting like in what we call the sutures which is where those two the two aspects of the bones. I'm so using my hands like this because if you if that's kind of what it's like and it's so what you'll see is what you're feeling your head is a little divot like a little sometimes you feel a little wine. So if you're not sure you can just run your  Down and going back and forward and you might feel I can feel a little little.  Little divot in there and so often that he knows along those lines are where many acupuncture points are and often you'll find in your head that is one or two spots that feel incredibly painful when you've got a headache like you might press and you might feel all that really hurts like it's but at the same time it's like a good feeling it feels like a good pain. So what do you do with that? Well often you can it's like a little acting like a little trigger.  In your head, you can press press press it. Like just like I am now I'm just basically using one finger or two fingers to kind of just press in on that spot, press it in. Maybe if you want to go even harder like make it stronger. You can manipulate your fingers. I'm doing this very obviously but just kind of like this back and forward sort of in those spots and often with these kind of pressure points. You need to hold them for a bit of time. So, let's say you have your your head throbbing you're in a lot of pain you can kind of press the points like that.  I'm mostly using my thumb's there, but I'm just resting my fingers on there. If your thumbs get tired, you can use the knuckles of your of your thumbs there at the side. So you can kind of just press in there and the other point that's often used is just at your temple. So this is one point here on your gall bladder Channel gallbladder one, but just back from that you have this soft area here now just use the pads of your fingers real gentle really gently to kind of just massage in there and you shouldn't feel any kind of title.  Um Pine or anything like that. We just that gentle pressure. But you can press in a little bit harder. They don't want to press too hard because you certainly wouldn't want to press. Yeah. Don't press too hard. But you can just press gently a lot of people like to combine acupressure with essential oil use. So the oil that I would recommend you use for headaches is lavender oil now if you're allergic to Lavender or you've got other reasons why you can't use lavender than don't use it, but  You can just use a carrier oil which is like I mean, you could just use cooking oil out of the cupboard if that's all that you've got a high-quality olive oils better than just standard vegetable oil. You could also use in massage therapy. They often use almond oil. Jojoba oil those kind of oils are nice oils to use when your skid soybean oil can be used and so you just using a little bit of oil to mix with the essential oils and then apply that to those areas.  Just like that. So that's the first one I would do on your face. That is called Taeyang T AI y Ang and it's kind of just in that spot there and then Yin Tang here. So the way you use this point here, which is just what most people would consider their third II error. So just between you two eyes at the bridge of just above the bridge of your nose. Now, when you press here, if you just press you can press with your thumb and press with your finger. It's not as  as effective as if you actually pinch it. So if you pinch that area pinching the skin together and is actually more effective because you're just you're really getting into that little bit of muscle that's there and printing those that muscle together rather than just pressing down on to the Bone. So that's a little tip that will make that so you can basically pinch and on your face you tend to want to press as generally much lighter than on like on your body. So on here on the her go point or any other points on your hands or feet  Compress a little hot or not on your face one is you don't want really what most people want to bruise on their face. I don't want to bruise on my face. So it press lighter and also your face is more sensitive. Your skin is more a lot more sensitive, especially if you do have even more sensitive than average sensitive skin, then you can just press it very lightly. If you've got thinner skin. You don't want it to sort of tear your skin by pressing things to heart. So there the first points I would start with this one is just massaging your own scalp like this going around and just feeling mmm. Does that feel good as a  Kind of some of the oh, wow. There's a really tight pop spot. They oh, wow, that really hurts. Okay so find those little trigger point. So it's really and you can just press them like a basically just pressing in so them holding them if I press two hands together, or I press in it and I can actually lean my head into my hand. So if I'm really tired I could less rest my hand on the desk and just sort of and you see people do that naturally just they do it because they're kind of in pain. It's just a natural way to kind of try to alleviate the pain. I'm so that's a good thing. You can try.  The other ones you could do is on the back of your neck. So here this is called a full choke or bladder 20. So just behind your neck. So how do you find that point on yourself? Well, okay go to your ear. And just if you feel behind your ear, you'll feel this bony protrusion sort of there and they're going little bit further back and you might feel that protrusion of the muscle in a ridgy kind of way here. So that points in between two muscles once your  That I caught a mess toward muscle or something just caught sem. It's got a really long time and then your trapezius. So the trapezius is the one at the very back. I'll just turn around here so you can kind of see.  Do it like that I turn around here. You can see that's the point there. So you can use your two thumbs in between there. Now. What I'm doing is I'm just holding here on my head a tiny bit, but mostly pressing in here. And another little trick is then to lean your head towards the the pot the point and that's a that's a super effective point to do and that's called gallbladder 20. So that's a really nice point to kind of press.  Press right in there and you can just get in there again if you get the wrong spot, but it's feeling good to you. You're not going to make it worse by pressing the wrong spot in those areas and you might even feel that through that SCM that Center clutter mastoid muscle that you have a bit of tightness that if it comes sort of round to the front here, you can see in the other video. I made I was talking about different how different channels like you to stomach her the large intestine Channel how that kind of relates to different areas this area. Here's the gallbladder area in  in Chinese medicine a gall bladder channel is relating to the shower Yang channels of the other xiaoyang channel is you're saying ciao. Ciao. So if you've got if this is relieving the pain and you feeling better from pressing that the other aspect that you want to process on your forearm, so how do you find that so just the middle between these two bones you can just massaged that channel up and down here. So there's a lot of points here. So it was right in the middle of your wrist. That's one.  Appoint such a for the main one. You probably want to use a center 5 which was two finger spaces apart from the center for sort of here and then a little bit further up now don't be worried so much more go for the channel. So you can just rub the channel. You can just rub literally just rub your thumb up and down you can what in Chinese Master they call Tambor which is like strumming across pressing across the other one that I really like to chat to recommend to people is me see if I've got a little pain or something on this.  This desk. No, I don't but what I do have heat I do for pain is pain this please hold them. Here we go. So here's a pen just a standard pen. Okay, so we don't have anything else. So one is you can click it down so that you just have the blunt end there now, that's  Two sharp, but you can use that as a little press. Oh now you're not poking it into the skin. But you just using that as a little thing to kind of press into the point, press into the point and you'll get a little very little pain mark on you just a circle payment or often the blunt end of the pen is a good one to use. So this is got the thing that presses the pen up and down. It's going to do that when I am clicking sound is picker, but that's really effective. You can do that. If you want that clicking sound doesn't annoy you too much.  Sort of do some massage like that and that brings me to the other aspect which is the bird packing. So I'm going to go down sort of the sand jail Channel, which is kind of like going down my arm.  And if you're not sure where these channels are just Google them. It's not that hard Sandow Asin Jiao Sandow is also translated as triple warmer or triple heater. And then the other one is your large intestines are this line intestine for point and if you're really interested in knowing about well, why do those things relate to headaches you can go and watch that headaches video the one I'll put in the description box bit more long-winded more about the Chinese medicine understandings of it and then you could just grab a key or something and just use the key to press.  The points that's another thing to do. I often acupressure quite commonly done through the clothing. And so then you can use an Implement like you can even do you can do with you if your thumb or your hands through the clothing? So I hope this video has been useful and helpful to you. If it has then I encourage you to go and seek help with a Chinese medicine practitioner. If you've got ongoing problems with headaches and you want to see if you can find the natural way to treat it.  It lots of people look for natural ways to stop pain because they want to get off painkillers or they just don't want to use painkillers on a regular basis. So, you know, there's nothing wrong with Western medicine like in Chinese medicine with a lot of practitioners, you know would use Western medicine on themselves or use Western medicine in some cases and lots of patients who use Chinese medicine use Western medicine as well. But the issue with chronic pain problems is when you're taking pain pills all the time, we're having second. So regularly they can have an impact.  On your digestive system on your like on your actual the actual digestion. So you stomach especially anti-inflammatory based ones or the issue. Some people have is just being overloaded in their kidneys or liver because they like working overtime all the time and they might be at the point where they're maxed out on painkillers. Sometimes people get headaches. They've already got another chronic health problem, which is mean they're taking a lot of painkillers already and then they get this other issue and they can't just add in more more pain medicine.  So go and see your Chinese medicine practitioner acupuncturist a registered acupuncturist or herbalist. And that way you'll be able to get that specific diagnosis. So these points are all just kind of very general generic point. So when would these be useful maybe if you're traveling and you and you can't get to a practitioner because you're on the airplane or something like that stuck in the airport. You've got a headache you're in a meeting and he just can't get out of that meeting at that moment and you want to try to relieve that pain if you can then these things can be used to help.  Finally the other tip. I would give people is try a hot pack. Now often you go for cold. You can you can try either a cold or hot pack but heat expands blood vessels makes blood vessels expand the best place to put the hot pack is on the back of your neck or on the top of your head. And so if you try the sometimes I even put the hot pack on my forehead what that does is it just makes blood vessels expand and then that can often alleviate the pain and at least you could get some symptomatic relief for a little while. So, I hope that  this video has been useful and helpful to you and look forward to seeing you again on the next.
Episode 53 when should I go for marriage therapy?  Welcome to the first year married podcast where we get real about building the marriage of your dream. I'm marriage Coach K 11, and I take newly married and engaged women from anxious insecure too confident and connected through practical tips real-life inspiration and more than a little self awareness along the way.  Hello, ladies this week. I have a super important episode for you. And I am so glad to be able to bring this to you. I have Simone Sobel who is both a marriage therapist and a trauma expert coming on the show to discuss all things marriage therapy. What are some red flags that you might want to be looking out for to see if it's time to escalate this to a therapist what to expect how to find a good therapist and so much more. I'm so happy to be  Entering this to you. I hope you really got a lot out of the podcast and I look forward to hearing from you about it. Enjoy.  Welcome back. Ladies. Thank you so much for tuning in. I am really looking forward to sharing this episode with you. I reached out to my friend Simone Sobel who is an atlanta-based psychotherapist a friend of mine because I thought it was really important. Some questions have been coming in about when you want to look for a marriage course or marriage coaching and when you want to work with a therapist now, I know there are some coaches out there that think that coaching can cover everything but I think that there are some amazing tools that they're of us have to offer and  Ask them to come on to sort of explore this topic with me. How would you know, how would you make that decision about who exactly you should go to and then if you do decide to go to a marriage counselor what you would want to look for and then what you would expect so just you have a little bit of a background on Simone. She as an atlanta-based psychotherapist who specializes in working with adults who have trauma and PTSD, but she is also a couple's counselor who works with couples who are in distress seeking to increase intimacy.  Ocean and secure bonding in their relationship. I really feel very fortunate that we have her on she is an extremely inspiring person who has this is like bare minimum description of what she does and all the things that she's trained in and skilled in as a human being. She's an extremely inspiring person to know so I'm looking forward to sharing her with you and Simone welcome to the first you married podcast. Thank you for coming on. Thank you for having me. Okay. So this is a pretty a pretty important topic I think for this audience.  It sure is and and I think it can also be a little bit of an intimidating one. So I'm really looking forward to hearing some of your perspective. Okay. So Simone, let's start here. So there are so many options out there. There's going to be a mentor there's going to you know, even like a religious advisor there is going to a therapist or or a coach taking classes. So when would somebody want to look into therapy specifically and what do you think about just all these options that are out there?  Yes, that is a great question. I think that coaching in particular is wonderful. I think couples can learn so many great skills so much of what we call psychoeducation just setting expectations differences between men and women can caishen skills different roles and how that is divided or spoken about.  Certainly would be great topics and I know you cover some if not all of those or podcast and in your protein, which is great. I think couples can really all couples can benefit from that. But before they get married and certainly at the beginning of marriage and then all through really we all need that, you know, I'm going infusions of skills that we can use practices that we can use but there are also times  times when Apple might be having a little bit more distress or a lot more distress when it would be indicated or recommended for them to probably seek out a therapist. There are some situations that really might call for considering therapy. So for example, if arguments have become more frequent or if  Communication is a really poor one. Maybe one of the partners feels frequently misunderstood. They can never get onto the same page about a particular issue like money or in-laws or if communication is completely dysfunctional. It's completely broken down, you know stonewalling chronic defensive nurse type of criticism Etc. Also if there's been some kind of breach of trust therapy would be recommended such as  Do you know one partner spending a lot of money in secret or maybe one partner finding out that the other is you know looking at pornography sometimes also if something very difficult or even devastating has happened such as when one partner loses a job or there is a major Health crisis rights or even loss of a child or parent also.  When there is maybe a life cycle change, let's say retirement or a new baby or empty nest or remove a major move therapy could be a good idea other situations, for example, if if couples feel very stuck in negative patterns or negative Cycles. This is a lot of what we do in therapy. We were gone.  Processing and sort of understanding and reorganizing some of those negative cycles and then sue, you know, I definitely have a couples having some sort of spiritually based issue. It's a good idea to speak to Pastor or Rabbi or somebody, you know, church or mosque or a synagogue or other spiritually oriented type.  person, but if a couple finds that they are going again and again to this virtual Mentor then that's generally assignment better idea and then to some couples come to therapy as to fine-tune what's already pretty good but you know, they might be getting stuck on a couple of issues and they just want to want things to be as good as they can be so some I love that and that's that's  it's an important point that you know, there are some of these heavier issues which would indicate going to a therapist and we'll talk later about how to make sure you're going to a really qualified therapist who really can help you the it's not required right that this is if you if you find someone or you think you can find someone who is going to be really good for you guys and you know, you have a couple things that you want to work on you don't it doesn't have to be a big heavy issue to speak with a couple's counselor. Right? Like a good counselor should be able to help with any little thing.  Improving the relationship strengthening it not just only dealing with crisis, right? That's exactly right a good therapist or counselor will certainly means a couple where they are and we'll be listening closely for the level at which they want to work what they want to work on how they want to work on it.  Very appropriate to go to a couples therapist and just want to fine-tune an issue or a couple of issues an area of stuckness. It doesn't have to be a big major issue. That's true. All right, I think one thing that's very very relevant which I'm hoping you can speak to specifically for women who are early on in our marriages is knowing when when is this an issue that they should you know, maybe they need more education. Maybe they don't really have good.  Communication maybe maybe they need to work on being more positive in their relationship or more respectful or any of these things that we might work on verse is he really is coming into the relationship with more issues than she realized. Maybe he has some I don't know whether it's narcissism or he has some kind of dysfunctional personality situation going on. And you know, how do we help these women? Who?  Can sometimes be sort of bending their head over trying to improve themselves when maybe it's a it's a it's a deeper issue what red flags could they look for that? Maybe this is something where they need to get more help than just taking classes.  yes, that's an interesting that's a good question and an important one, you know one very big red flag is when a woman feels consistently criticized and put down in a way that makes her feel ongoingly insecure or demeaned or shamed and  Add kind of a situation is not in a spectrum of healthy or normal in a relationship. If it's chronic and Cindy are you know, we all we can all be critical and sometimes we can lose our tempers and can say things that we regret but you know, if that's an ongoing situation a woman might be trapped in what we call a cycle of abuse, you know, which is where there's a sort of ongoing.  Asian and then sort of a calm period and period and impact to a very severe provocation and so women should really also look out for attempts by men to you know, isolate them. For example, you know Port they need contacts. I need friends. They need to be around family and community and if they're finding that there  is an ongoing attempt to isolate them or to criticize people that there are close to their support network. That would be a red flag. So another red flag, very important one is if a spouse or a partner cannot ever take responsibility, I would say that's probably one of the biggest if not the biggest issue if it is always one Partners fault, you know, particularly.  You know from the perspective of a woman, although this can happen both ways, obviously, so if she is always the one to blame no matter what and there's never an apology. There's never any remorse. There's never any attempt to take, you know, just to see the other side of the story or to accept any responsibility for causing pain or negative things in the  And ship that that that can make things pretty unworkable and that's probably a sign that there's something else going on such as abuse or a personality disorder or both of those things. You can exist together or some kind of other mental health issues and I think so, I think I just want to pull out a couple things. You said that I think are really important. So one is you said chronic. So as you said and this is one that I think is it's such a good thing to be able to go.  The therapist to validate concerns like this because I will see a lot of times if a woman is just asking a group of friends, you know, then it's very easy for the friends to say like this is this is unacceptable that's abusive that's you know, but maybe you know, he had a bad night and he really isn't like that and you know, something's coming out of context. So a therapist can see if this is really a pattern versus human being sometimes Being Human and sometimes we make mistakes. So chronic was one but then you also said which was really interesting it's chronic, but it's also  So a cycle right like there might be an apology in between there might be an improvement but then it comes back. So I think sometimes women get sucked into thinking that it's not really an ongoing issue right because because he did apologize or because it got better for a little while, right and absolutely couples can get into negative cycles and things can get pretty heated and they can say pretty critical and negative things to each other and it doesn't necessarily.  Really mean that that it's gusev, you know, and so yes, a therapist is really in a position to determine where along the spectrum of normal healthy versus dysfunctional completely unhealthy and even abusive the situation is and how chronic it is how much of a pattern it is and and whether you know, it's sort of a cycle meaning that both partners.  Kind of trigger each other whether it's really a one-sided situation in which my partner is tends to be the perpetrator and the other the victim. Do you think that one other thing that you said that I think is so important is that you know, women sometimes can go to their friends. My recommendation would be find one person to speak with who is supportive probably why?  Is on a more mentoring side obviously in a situation in which Justice.  Woman one would want to speak to more than one person because she doesn't want to be isolated but innocent about when we're not talking about an abusive situation, you know, whenever I just be concerned about negative things that are happening in her marriage. It's probably best to just find one person to to ventilate feelings with and really where a coach or a therapist can come in is to be neutral and judgmental and help without without an agenda.  Speak right, right someone who's not really using this to get some excitement in their own life. Right? Right, right really therefore for you and I also think another one that's helpful is, you know, go to somebody that you'll listen to if they call you on your stuff, right? Like you have to respect them enough that if they say, okay, but also, you know, they play something out or you going to be willing to to hear it from them. If not, I might not be the right person right? That's exactly right. You don't want to  Be you're not paying a therapist or coach to hear only what you want to hear is sometimes can be uncomfortable. But necessary to hear some hard things. Absolutely. So I'm times plans don't want to don't want to say those things but the trained professionals I don't have an issue with this responsibility to do it. Right? So I just want to take a second here and clarify. You know, I think that this is this is starting to sort of Take Shape for me even as we're discussing. I know you and I have talked about this.  The past but so for someone who's again trying to sort of see this distinction for sure when we're dealing with something that could be sort of chronic or could be a personality disorder or could be no, we're just not getting out of the pattern. Another thing that you described to me Simone about what you can do and this is why I personally don't work with couples. I only work individually with a woman is that you're trained in sort of going meta and seeing how these couples are interacting with each other in real time.  I'm in the session and then working with them on that as there in the room with you. Correct? That's exactly right. Yes, correct therapists, you know the type of couple therapy that I do is very process-oriented. So in other words couples might come with some specific content issues. They might Begin by asking what do we do about this? So why do you know this specific fight, huh?  and but very quickly we go beneath the surface and we start to examine deeper emotions deeper needs deeper fears how they trigger each other how they set off emotions in each other that can be very negative how they, you know can can react internally and then pass some of that strong emotion over to each other in a way that's really can be  sort of counterproductive that can work against them getting what they really so desperately want and need and okay. So I just curious about this about this answer if we use it or not. So if you're dealing with a couple of say where one of them is being triggered by a behavior from another one, so how do you balance between educating one member, you know, like one partner versus creating a  Victim situation where this person is now like a victim to their trigger as opposed to them starting to work on doing their own work as well.  On that trigger, right and having more spent more awareness, I guess of realizing that this emotion is really coming from what's going on with them is that question makes them? Yes, that makes perfect sense. So the process of couples therapy and particularly the type of therapy that I do what's that was really called? It's emotionally focused couples therapy. Okay EFT, which was developed by a Canadian psychologist students in the hole.  Idea about about this therapy being emotionally focused is about within and between so that process happens in real-time experientially in the room and each partner gets an opportunity to sort of get pulled into their emotions and into what they're experiencing whenever a particular cycle.  Comes up and we will have these Cycles to sort of these head-banging issues that you know, we kind of feel very very stuck in that we can't get past that always tend to happen in the same way. They pay out the same way. And so it's a chance to really slow things down and to work with each partner on examining very deeply what's going on within them an emotional level. What are the strong emotions? What are the most emotions below the emotions? It's a lot going on in the room.  What are emotions that are coming up based on past stuff? You know what we call attachment needs, you know, very deep need needs that human humans have you know to connect also what we call attachment fears, you know our deepest fears in relationship, you know, when the most vulnerable what is coming up for each partner in that moment. That is so much of a fear and also in which there is so much money.  Going and yearning and then what we'll have each partner do is rarely express that to pass that over to their partner in a way that is not accusatory. That is not negative. That is somehow different in the way. They usually communicate their feelings in that process. A lot of empathy gets opened up. A lot of insight gets opened up couples really start to see each other at a very Elementary.  Well, very vulnerable very real level and that's where all the magic can happen between them and they can start really listening to each other and start responding to each other and completely different ways. So it's interesting. So it's not even just that it's not even the resolution but even the process itself is really an opportunity for the couple to get to know each other better and to build a deeper relationship and more understanding for one another absolutely. It is all about the process and I say this to couples all the time.  I am not going to solve your problems for you. And I'm not even going to help you to solve your problems in this room. When I'm going to help you to do is to work on your process. So that no matter what comes your way. You can still be holding hands through the storm, you know, like when uses this language and now the phenomenal therapist, you know, can we talk about him a lot? Yes, I'm sure so he talks about holding couples holding hands through the storm. So no matter  What comes a couple's way? They are still talking to each other. There are still using their adaptive healthy nurturing process through the stress. They are there are aware of what they could do to trigger each other's deepest fears for a lot of negativity and kind of shoot themselves and each other in the foot in so doing versus kind of slowing the moment down and possibly turning to each other and saying hey I'm out. We're doing this thing that we do again. Let's not  Not do that. Let's not go there. I know that you're afraid of XYZ and I'm afraid of XYZ. Let's do this together and it's talk about it. Let's deal with it. And then all of a sudden they're at the level not of content but of process they're working through problems in a way in the studio process and it's if they're healthy for and productive process amazing. But what we say is that they're finding exits are not stop right there. They're not stuck in their issues.  Access it's so interesting because we had just done an episode recently called your relationship momentum. And so it's very similar this idea of are we moving forward are we able to bounce back and just you know what that I need to apologize for that. Can we keep going and sometimes we do get to that place for very stuck. It's very hard to move out in that route that you're in. So this is this is very timely. Okay. So let's say someone's listening here and they're saying okay. This is describing me. You know, I either am concerned that  there's very negative cycle going on or just that we're in a bad Dynamic and I want I want us to have the skills together. I want to work in real time with a therapist. How should somebody go about or even if you want to talk about what people do I think you didn't he write an article about how not to find a good couples therapist? Yes, and I'm going to tell you she got to go how to find a really bad couple therapy because we can  I know I said that one before I'll have to make sure to include it in the show notes for this episode because it's really fabulous. What would be some of the main points that you would want to make sure people know about primarily want to make sure that whomever you choose is qualified. So couples therapy has a very high failure rate there lots of reasons for that. But one of the reasons one of the main reasons, is that a lot of  Who are really trained in individual therapy are doing couples therapy? And that doesn't really work its own specific type of therapy. It's not an easy therapy be and you definitely want somebody who is experienced what we call Seasoned who tends to work with couples either exclusively or as a pretty major focus of their practice because you know, as I say there is a lot going on in that room and you definitely want to feel as  You're in good hands. So the question is, how do you find somebody? Who's how do you know? Yes, how do you know so there are different ways that you can find a good couples therapist. So definitely word of mouth is a big way, you know, although you want to be cautious about that because people especially let's say on social media can tend to want to recommend their friends or  or business associates or people that they feel personally connected to but that might not be the best fit for a couple ask clergy member because they very often are asked for a feral. So they've a lot of them have built up lists over many years. I know that I am working with several rabbis on referral lists and putting together different strong referral sources for them.  All the time. So that is a good sort of attention communication good place to love also with a primary care doctor. They're often ask for referrals or there are also, you know sort of the major couple therapy Styles. So gottman Imago and also emotionally focused couples therapy, I think in that article that you reference  I it's possible. I'm just I just have to think about it. I think that I reference, you know, the websites of these are different and National organizations. And so all of them should have local referral pages and they will have sort of certified therapists in those particular areas. You really looking for somebody who is certified in a particular type of couple therapy or who has been intense.  Trained in a particular type of couples therapy. He's been working with couples for a reasonable amount of time that is early and you be you know, you're looking for somebody that you can get ahold of initially and speak to and ask questions to you know, such as what is your process? How do you work with a couple how can you help us? What is the main focus so and that'll give you a good sense of whether it could be a good fit just in terms of chemistry or personality.  Very important. That's great. So most most couples therapist will take that initial intake Hall even before booking an appointment, correct?  Most of them. Well, there are some sort of superstars that you can never get out of the rain. They have waiting lists and enough people have recommended them that it's kind of a situation if I can get into this person. Then I'm definitely going to see them. I believe in really speaking to the therapist. They have excellent reputations. It's still an issue of chemistry. You still write or maybe even just going into that first session with the in you know, with the intention to be checking it out.  As opposed to actually writing to you whenever obligated. There's no sort of, you know ongoing a contract that a couple should know couple should be asked to sign such a often. There's a contract for treatment, you know, just a consent form but not kind of a, you know, you are required to do a certain number of sessions, right? It's not like a six-month would definitely be a red flag and I think that that's something that you know can turn people off is that they have one bad experience and then it might write off.  The whole the whole deal right as opposed to you're saying, you know you if you're checking for chemistry and you have evidence that this person knows what you need or is trained specifically for couples. So then you're already starting first of all in a much better place than you know, your father's old college roommate to sit into therapy, right? And then even after the fact to to keep your finger on the pulse that you know, you're not there to please the therapist and if the relationship  not working and if you don't feel that this is a good connection then again back to momentum might be time to look again and to find a better fit. Absolutely. I say this about AA meetings, NA meetings therapists, you know, it can be difficult to tell the same story to different people but I really highly recommend persevering if you've gone for the first time or even a few times and it's just not feeling as though anything is clicking or anything.  Is moving in. Anyway, you're not you're not seeing any benefit whatsoever Beyond just sort of the normal situation and couple therapy is a lot of hard work and it can take a little bit of time to resolve some issues. If you're really not feeling any forward momentum or benefit at all. I really recommend just playing and find things in the house and not giving up I get a lot of couples who tell me that they've had  Negative experiences and my job is then to to turn things around and to show them that you know, yeah, it's not easy. Right? So let's so they so now they know where to look we're going to put the all I also include the link.  To those three places you mentioned. So right guys, we're not go billing like couples therapist and your ZIP code. You're going to go find you know, you want to work with a common therapist. You can go to the Garmin website and you'll be able to search by where you are and find somebody who's certified by gottman or by EFT or was the other one Imago and fresh. It's not bad to Google per se but then you want to do a little bit more research like you might go to to a therapy referral site like Psychology today dark.  Calm and just kind of do more research on the therapist credentials. Make sure they have what we call an NPI number a national provider identifier so that you know that they're licensed in college. I took practice therapy, you know in their particular field and how long they've been in practice you might see a photograph with them there, but you know what they specialize in just get more of a flavor for how they work.  Very special carbon postseason. That's very helpful. Okay, and then so now the person's gone ahead. They've had a phone call. It sounds like it might be a good, you know a good match. They go in. What are they going to expect? What do they what should they expect going into the office?  Because I imagine that part of what would be holding somebody back from really pursuing therapy might just be this unknown.  Sure, that can be really scary. So I do I get this question a lot. Every therapist is different, but I can tell you what I do and what I know some of my colleagues do is emotionally focused and biased in a sense that you know, this is a type of therapy that I think is very very effective in the literature but in spaced  Type of therapy that can be very effective for couples who are in distress couples who want to work on negative Cycles. So what I generally do is I like to speak to the couple on the phone if I can speak to them together that's best generally but not necessary and we set up the appointment and like a lot of therapists. He'll just send them some sort of introductory paperwork, which they'll fill out and they'll bring in and you know, it'll just have some basic questions about  what they're struggling with and where they think they'd like to have some help but I tell you what I will do is I will meet with a couple together for our first session and just get a sense of their Dynamic and how they interact and how they view the relationship as a couple how they speak about it when they're together how how they sort of conduct themselves when things are challenging.  You know, what are some strength in the relationship? How did they meet? You know, how do they talk about how they first met? What what do they enjoy doing together? You know, what are they feel they have in common, where do they struggle or feel that? They don't have things in common? So that first session is really just to get to know them as a couple and their Dynamic I'll then separate them and meet with each of them.  The separately this is more of an in-depth appointment with each of them to get to know how each one of them tends to view the relationship. Maybe they'll say some things that are difficult to say when they're together. Also, I'm looking for what we call attachment history. I'm really going into their relationship with their parents their religion their parent parents relationship with each other how affection was shown are not shown in the family.  How conflicts are resolved, you know, whether any traumas what was going on in the family and just get a sense of sort of an attachment style and maybe some attachment needs and fears of migraines forming some of the issues that are cropping up in the in the current relationship. And then what I'll do is I'll bring them back together and we put them together again, and that's sort of constitutes the formal.  One period and I will talk to them about what I've noticed and what I've observed.  Wait for it how I see that we can start to get in there and work on some of their issues. That's sort of my process. Okay, great. And then it's really helpful just for people to sort of see what the couple first couple sessions might look like or just even even hearing from you sort of what you're thinking behind the scenes. I think takes away the mystery a little bit of this of this whole process. So thank you so much for that is what I what I would add to that, you know, I  The assessment is very important. It gives us a good Strong place to begin, but very quickly. I like to get into processing and into sort of situation with a couple where we can really get kind of down and dirty and start to work on their process. They can start to see some results relatively quickly and feel some sense of hope that that they can do a lot better and they can feel better and  they can start to relate to each other with a lot more positivity.  Amazing. Are there any situations where?  You know if somebody's thinking I don't even know if it's worth it are there situations where you know, this this line has been crossed then just it's not exactly there's no there's no way forward or therapy therapy can't help you. I know what I'm saying. I like that. We sort of see it an obvious probably I'm assuming you're going to say no you should still meet with somebody but I think that sometimes people really do feel like, you know, I know I've heard in the past someone's asked me.  Not that my husband cheated on me and I think that means that I have to like am I even allowed to stay with him at this point? Like she really felt like there was there was a Line in the Sand about the only way that you can possibly respond to it. So I do see that sometimes people have these sort of rules for themselves where they or they even wonder if it's salvageable. So what would you say to somebody who doesn't even know if it's worth it. That's kind of what they're thinking like, I don't even know who's going to do anything or think. We're too far gone. What would you say to them?  Yes, so it really is for me part of the assessment is evaluating where each partner is in terms of wanting to work on the relationship wanting to end the relationship or whether they're ambivalent and want to explore whether the relationship is worth saving and sometimes the ramesseum cage and sometimes they're on different pages into my job to sort of get them onto the same page.  Whatever that that option is going to be infidelity does not in and of itself mean at a relationship has to end our I know that folks have rules beliefs. A lot of times these come from you know, they're useful for belief. So there, you know strongly held beliefs from you know from the past or from way. They growing up Etc, but the idea, you know the whole  A point and that a lot of sort of EFT therapists do is to really restore a sense of trust in the relationship. So that both Partners can feel safe. They can have a sense of Safety and Security and relationship. Sometimes particularly in you know, teaching a egregious situations in which trust is being breached. It is not salvageable and sometimes it is, you know, and I would say you don't know until you explore it but both Partners have to want to explore it.  You know, if one partner or even both of them feel that it's over then sometimes I'll get a couple sort of making one last ditch effort, but deep down inside you've already given up on the relationship and maybe one or both of them are really just looking for permission rational persons professional stamp. It's okay for you to just separate it. And this was very important to emphasize that there are situations in which couples therapy is  Is not recommended where it might be or it is more beneficial for one or both Partners to have individual therapy. So for example, if there is active abuse going on in the relationship sexual physical emotional moral religious psychological abuse and it is untreated and address.  Then that is not a situation in which safety is going to be able to create it in that couples therapy session or in that room. So it is far more important for both the perpetrator and the victim to have their own therapy also situations where there is active untreated addiction spouse and also  Turner to get treatment and to get therapy on their own also where there is active infidelity where one partner is having an affair and doesn't want to give using to give the affair up. That would not be a situation where safety be could be created in therapy because there are p is really really all about couple therapy is about becoming very vulnerable and no competent therapist is going to open a couple up and have  Either one of them become vulnerable if there is a potential for one of them to become injured while being vulnerable. Now, the situation would be active untreated very severe mental illnesses spouse has you know bipolar or severe depression or another type of mental illness that is not being treated and is refusing to get treatment. So that would not be a situation. Where a  Therapy would be a safe situation necessarily. I think correct me if I'm wrong about this, but for some of these situations, you know, let's say there's active abuse I'm assuming that in most cases. I'm hoping all of them. The therapist is going to be working with the victim to get safe to work on maybe what about them into that situation or how they can I don't know get out of it safely and that's why that's where they're going. The primary issue is to keep the abused.  Partner safe safety has to come first and then of course the perpetrator needs to have treatment and that may be a situation that is able to be rehabilitated and maybe not in which case the victim can have therapy that allows fair or him. It can happen both ways to find safety.  T and B develop the confidence and the skills and the sense of empowerment to make decisions to act, you know on her best interest to my you know to separate herself from the relationships and safety definitely comes first. So there's safety and then there's sort of a exploration of possible Rehabilitation or where we want to move forward and then sort of moving forward. But so when you talked about mental illness  Now I could imagine that in there are certainly situations where one partner might have serious mental illness in the other partner doesn't want to leave that person, right? They see that this person is suffering and this isn't cause for divorce so when they're doing separate therapy and understanding what you're saying is that if I'm understanding correctly what you're saying is that we can't do this this High vulnerability exercise if one person isn't well, but what what is it that we want to be working on? What would they be working on separately?  Lie, that would be helping the person who's not suffering from mental illness, especially if it's a situation where she doesn't necessarily want to leave the relationship, right? So I wouldn't say that if one partner has a mental illness and was not well as you say or has an addiction can be abusive, you know, I would not say that, you know, a couple therapy is is never indicated. You know that  Everything needs to be completely under control. So the point is just that the partner who is suffering from the addiction of the mental illness who's struggling with this is willing to receive treatment is receiving treatment, you know, there are a lot of ups and downs with things are easier and sometimes they're more challenging. It doesn't mean a couple content of couples therapy. It just means that there has to be a willingness to work on things. So that becoming vulnerable is not out of the question.  Question, right? So then, you know just to answer your question about what spouse would work on is to mention doesn't relationship. And you know, let's say her husband's mental illness is having his own treatment. So then really it's about psychoeducation having her understand what he's going through and what the symptoms are and what the treatment is and how  You can best support him. It's also about empowering her and giving her confidence and assertiveness teaching her about physical boundaries. Sometimes those things can get very difficult and challenging and very muddy in those types of situations so that she can maintain Health between them and in their family and it's also about her just having a place to ventilate feelings and to really good coping skills and good.  Self-care and just having an advocate for her somebody on her team and on her side who can be there for her because it's a difficult situation and it's definitely requires support and sometimes professional support and that's where therapy isn't very helpful to partner of somebody who is struggling with meetings Okay amazing. This was so so helpful. Thank you so much. I think that this really breaks down.  Of all I'm just really glad that we were able to address that first question about newlyweds because I you know the idea of somebody really just trying to work on herself when really there might be a more more problematic Dynamic going on that needs professional help. I think that this can be very very helpful for people to just here to whether the recogniz in themselves are there for talking to other people. So that's really helpful. I think also you broke down a lot of the mystery around this whole process.  So you showed us that this can be for a very traumatic or very difficult situations that can also be for a couple who just wants to fine-tune and just wants to go from there. Everything's great. But why not have an A+ why not have your marriage be one of the best parts of your life not just going. Well, right and seeing that whole spectrum of possibility and it is so so helpful. So I just want to thank you for coming on for giving us this whole overview welcome.

Thank you. My name is am grateful recovering compulsive overeater. I'm very happy to be here. Nice to see Sherry again, you know the whole idea of connections with other recovering compulsive Overeaters through service has completely changed my life when I came into program. I never felt that I belonged anywhere even in Family always felt like I was really different than everybody in my family the people around me. I was a single parent, you know, and I was living in the midwest. I was in living in Nebraska when I came into program and you know, I had married friends with children and I had single friends with no children. So, you know, there was like we didn't connect, you know.  You know, the people that I worked with I was teaching at the time that people I worked with most of them were young and didn't have children. So they could you know, spontaneously say after work, let's do and I would say I can't do that because I have to get home to my child. So I never felt like I fit in anywhere and when I started with OE, I began to feel like I've found my tribe found my peeps the people who got me.  And and then I after I'd been in the program for less than a year. I moved to California. I just picked up, you know my kid and my cat and moved to California and with no job and you know, when I got here, you know, I thought it would be a couple of months before I found a job and it was six months and you know, that's when I lost my abstinence because I was terrified. I was terrified I moved because I didn't fit in but I remember one time.  I'm saying you know, I should have stayed there where I would wear. I had a job and I was miserable but I had a job and I had some security but I was miserable. Well, luckily for me. You know, I had a I had the program I got two meetings right away and I had a how do people move from one place to another without being in a 12-step program. How do they do that? I don't know and I'm glad I didn't have to know.  Um that so I knew how to get connected right away and and I've been doing service almost from the very beginning as Jerry said I'm now the chair of region to if anybody had told me that I was going to be doing that when I came into program, I would have turned right around and left. You know, I always want to know what's going to happen, but God knows that if I did it would scare me to death.  With so he only releases a little information at a time because my mother father God knows that that's all I can handle but I still have that. I want to know I want to know I want to know so I love this program. I've learned so much. Like I said, I've done a lot of service at the group level at the intervertebral. I've been the inner group chair.  Of two different inner groups a couple of times each one been a region rep. I've been a World Service delegate. I've done on the board at Region to twice now. I was a vice chair in the late 80s and and now the chair and you know doing things has just I learned so much about myself. I was the chair of the region to convention in 1988 and when they asked me to chair I Cry  cried because I knew I couldn't do it, you know, so it's like I have to talk to my sponsor. So I got home. I talked to my sponsor and she said well, of course you're going to do it as like I am  And you know, I learned so much. I had so much fun being the chair of that convention and I learned so much about me about my organizational skills about my team building skills that I didn't know I had I did not know I had and I could take those into my work life. So I you I practiced on you because you were safe. You weren't going to you know fire me if I didn't do it perfectly.  So I got to practice on you where it was safe and then I could take it back into my professional life. And I found that I could build teams and I could be a project manager. I could be a people manager. I could do those things but I practiced on you first because you were safe. So I strongly encourage people to step up and be part of a team that's putting on a retreat or organizing the day on OA.  Or or being the speaker getter for a meeting or whatever kind of service because I've learned that it's such an amazing growth opportunity in a place that's very safe and being able to take that back into my professional life was amazing to me was totally amazing to me and I continued to see that that these are skills that I learned I had by doing service in oh, ah.  And it doesn't mean that I always did it with no fear. That was not true. But what I found is that if I could just be the channel God's Channel then things turned out they just turned out it was just amazing. I remember I was also the program chair for the World Service convention that was in San Francisco in 93. I think it was  And so it was like yeah, I want to do that. I know what I want to do. I can get people together because it already practiced that and lower levels and it was really a lot of fun and we chose topics from the for today. And so I have one of the for today books that we had that we used in each of the meeting rooms the workshop rooms at the at that convention.  so it's like  you can carry it on and when I read the the for today, I just get to see that there's always new things in there who puts those new things in you know, because the for today I have that one's from 93 and the one I initially bought that's about falling apart. I got when it first came out and I can't remember what year that was, but I've cannot continually read that and I read the for today and the voices of recovery this morning and one of the  Exam one to share from the fort for today for today for today for June 22nd because I really love this. It says unhappy is the man though. He ruled the world who doesn't consider himself supremely blessed Seneca. The fact that I'm here at all is a blessing would I have chosen not to be born? That is the alternative the fact that I no longer have to eat.  No longer have to compulsively overeat is a supreme blessing indeed continuing the way I was going. I might not still be around today that makes each day against the habit of complaining of wishing things were different is nothing more than a way of ensuring depression and misery that's where I came from. I always wanted to be different as I expose this and other destructive habits to the 12-step program.  Asking God to remove them. I can allow myself to be happy.  I am coming to realize that is not life. That owes me something it is. I who owed? Oh something to life for today to access except myself is to enjoy my love life and to feel supremely blessed.  And that's what step 6 and 7 are all about for me is they're my favorite steps. And the reason they are my favorite steps is because I saw the biggest change in my life with having Character defects removed. I came in as a rageaholic.  Anger was my emotion.  My mother was a rageaholic I learned from her. I was emotionally verbally and sometimes physically abusive to my child not proud of that. But that's the truth. That's the truth and with six and seven. I learned how to do my life without raging. I'm in a temper tantrum was like a daily thing and sometimes more than once a day.  You know and so it was like I was like a volcano this those Steam and the pressure would build up and then I'd explode and then I feel a little bit better, but then I felt guilty because I exploded and you know, and the people around me were all in, you know shock mostly my son.  You know, that's that wasn't a fun way to live.  and what I learned when I was working six and seven was about  giving myself a timeout when I was about to explode. It's like okay and you have to go to your room not my son me because that was the time when he was a teenager and he and I are very similar. We both want to have the last word and we both know were right.  So, you know what happened that you know, he would be sassy to me and I would say two adult talk to me like that and he would say, well you talk to me like that and he was right. So my change had to be that had to be my change. So the timeout kept me from saying those words out loud. I would write them in my journal pressing very hard.  And would call my sponsor. So I'm gonna go to your room and write call your sponsor, you know, and it started to get better and then he would say he would be mouthy and I would say to him don't talk to me like that different tone of voice and he would say, well you talk to me like that and then I could say to him you and I both know that I used to talk to you like that, but I don't anymore.  And it got better and you got better and what I learned that under that anger.  Was Fear  disappointment or hurt feelings  And if you you know what by being angry and raging nobody got close enough to see how vulnerable it was.  And that is that put me in a in a prison.  Because in order for me to get better I had to be vulnerable.  I had to say to him what I was feeling like when he was going to school in San Diego, and he went to Park City Utah to ski for a semester that was 1991. He still there. No, he did not go back to school. So I was there and you told me it wasn't going to go back to school and I just cried.  But what I could say to him it was I'm afraid you're ruining your life, but it's not my life. It's yours.  And so he could and it was amazing because I've been a program by that time.  About 10 years and so he'd been around program for that amount of time and he could just let me cry and not say don't cry mom. You know, he just let me cry and let me own my stuff.  But at that time, I knew I was really disappointed and I was afraid I was afraid he was going to ruin his life. Well now he has his own business and he's being very successful and you know, he'll be able to support me in my old age. You know, he's healthy happy and financially independent and ain't going to be able to take care of me when I told him I was going to spend all my money so no and I thought he was going to ruin his life.  And needless to say God knew better than I did, which is always the truth. But what I got them, too.  Was some empathy with my mother whom I never got along with who was a rageaholic. She died when I was 23 long before I got into program that when I got pregnant and then got married that she thought the same thing I was going to ruin my life.  I had ruined my life.  But I didn't I finish college. I got my degree. I got my degree in May of 1972 and she died in October of 1972. She saw me get my degree. She was there when I graduated, you know, but I didn't get how she was so angry and mean to me when I told her I was pregnant.  And I got it. I got it. She thought I would have ruined my life.  She was pregnant before she got married in 1928.  And she didn't get to go on with what she wanted to do with her life, but I did.  I did and I got such.  Understanding of my mother that you know, I've done a lot of inventory. So my mother for a long time it was you know, I called her the bitch and I started to get more appreciation for her and the things that she went through and working through that. I actually found of her a picture of her high school graduation picture and I put it on my altar.  And that's how I was able to finally be able to think about my mother without colander the bench.  I got to really look at here's this young woman graduating from high school with her future in front of her.  Thank you that she wasn't able to she wasn't able to walk that path. That future went away.  And she thought that's what was going to happen to me too. But I was on a mission. I was going to finish college. My son was two and a half when I graduated. So it was like no I am going to get this degree. I will get it and I did and I'm so grateful that you know as a I was young. So I was 20 when he was born. So at that time I had a lot more energy than I do now. I couldn't have had a child.  Now I could be raising a child and going to school full-time could not and I'm really grateful to my husband ex-husband that he supported me.  Well, I finished school.  So, you know, I've been blessed throughout my life most of the time I didn't know it.  I didn't know how blessed I was.  Today I do today. I know how blessed I am.  We were talking on the way over about you know those unexpected.  Financial things that come you know, and you know, I needed I need to do something. I'm so blessed because I have the money to do it. I may not have wanted to spend it that way but I have the money and I just try to think of remind myself that it's God's money. It just happened to be in it happens to be in my checking account. It's God's money. This is how you're going to spend it.  And then I'm grateful that yes.  I can do that.  So I'm just so glad I am so blessed and so grateful. I'm retired. I love being retired. I love to read so I've been to book groups, but I decided I'm taking the summer off because I don't want to read anything that I don't want to read I get to choose and I've got all these books on Reserve at the library and trying to manage how the which ones come up right now. They're all seem to all be coming up at the same time. So I'm going to have  Read really fast but life is good. I'm so blessed. I live in Aptos Santa Cruz County. We've got all these free concerts during the summer. There's one on Wednesday night in Capitola and Thursday night at the Crow's Nest and Friday night at the boardwalk and they're all free live music and so my friends and I are trying not to get too crazy and going to a lot of them and it's just  just such a blessing. I have the energy to do that. I have the desire to do that. I have people in my life who like to do those kinds of things, you know, so I'm so blessed.  So so blessed and I didn't know that most of my life.  That God was taking care of I've been in the program more than half my life.  I came in in 80 where I was. Let's see. Why would I turn Thirty one in October of 80 and now I'm going to turn 70 in October. How did that happen? I supposed to be my son is 49. I'm supposed to be that age. I don't know how that happened. It's just crazy, but I'm blessed. I'm healthy. I'm probably healthier than I've ever been in my life I eat.  In a healthy way, I exercise. I've never done that.  And I have people in my life that I can be real with.  What more healthy happy and I'm financially independent to so far so good. But I mean I like I told my son I'm spending it. I love to travel. So I'm spending it. So that was one of the things when I ran to be chair of region to it was like well, is it going to interfere with my vacations? Well, I've had to work around but I still managed vacation.  which is  which is why I love being retired. I get to go and do things and I love to travel.

Hello and welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host today Jake and it has been a little while or a long while since my last podcast but I'm back and today. I've got a very special episode particularly for those who are looking to build a significant home staging business. And in this case when I say it I'm talking about a million dollar-plus Revenue business and I don't think that there's actually a lot of those in Australia or at least in their home staging industry. So if that is your ambition listen closely if it's not you'll still get a lot out of this chat.  It's actually my first guests from outside or based outside Australia. So International podcast, it's Melissa Mauro from Rave home staging. She's based in Jacksonville, Florida and Melissa moved to Jacksonville to start her business Rave home staging completely from scratch around about six years ago, and I'm going to let her share some of the numbers around her business and the growth that they've achieved over that fairly short amount of time. Melissa is a regular speaker at some of the industry events in the US and I'm told  In other countries, not Australia yet, but we'll look at that in the future. She recently gave a keynote at the International Association of home staging professionals conference bit of a mouthful and I broke down a lot of that talk when we spoke earlier and after the dive deeper on some of the key messages that she she and her thoughts on the industry some of the things that we covered how she thinks about marketing and her focus on putting out educational content how she's changed her pricing structure and it's something that I've not seen in.  In Australia, and she's done it to ensure that price is never an objection again from her clients. So most in the industry would like to have that where other Home stages are going wrong in her opinion by using what she calls pretty talk and the one thing that Melissa would change in her business. If she could now we did have the the connection drop out halfway through the interview, but hopefully with the magic of editing you won't even notice as I said, there's a lot of great stuff in this chat. So without dragging it on any longer, please enjoy this chat with  Listen, all right. Well firstly welcome Melissa. Thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for having me. Not a problem. And you're joining me. I'm sitting here in our warehouse. It's 8 a.m. In the morning in Brisbane. You're joining me and I think it's five o'clock where you are. Tell us where you're based. Yeah, so we're in Jacksonville Florida and I am actually home. I came home because our warehouses a little noisy at this time of day. So I am doing this from home. So you may potentially hear a dog barking in the background ha ha I've got signs up all over the doors so that  Team knows that I'm here according. So hopefully they keep quiet for us. So what I usually start by asking my guess what they were doing before they got into their current staging business, but it's a bit different for you because this is actually your second staging business. So how about first we start with what we're doing before you got into the home staging industry great. So I was a manager for a real estate office. So I was the office manager. I gave Karen instruction to a lot of the realtors that  In our office, I managed to look at all their contracts and make sure that they had everything done correctly and would often help them with things on MLS and prior to that. I actually worked for a real-estate office in recruiting. So I was out there trying to recruit agents for the company. So I've been in real estate in one form or another for quite a lot C over over 20 years now, I would say and I think that's probably going to be a couple of things where we talk about where we've got very different.  Real estate Industries for those that sitting in Australia and don't know what MLS is. Can you give me a quick snapshot of that? Sure MLS is our multiple listing service. And that's basically when an agent has a property for sale, they will enter the information online to the MLS and other real estate agents can see what properties are available. And then that information is also typically fed to sites. Like I don't know if you have them over there but too  Zillow and realtor.com and truly a places like that where individual people then can see what houses are for sale and often their searches will start there, but it all begins with the agent putting their new listing in to a service that sort of spreads that information out. Sure. So for us in Australia, it'll be realestate.com and domain.com probably the two big ones so similar just a different different set of sites over there. Was there a particular moment or was it a kind of series of  events or what was it that actually made you decide to leave that prior role in the real estate office and move into starting your own business. Sure. Well, I actually really hated my boss and my real estate office. I found her to be a completely unethical person and I hate to say that but that is the truth. And so I need dreaded going to work every day, even though I actually loved my job and at the time there was a TV show called sell this  Yes, and I loved watching that and I found that I actually could tell them what would actually be better choices than what they were making at the time. I had grown up in a family where my mother was actually a professional faux finisher and my aunt was she wasn't an interior designer but she had considered purchasing interior design franchise and things like that. And so I kind of grew up around a lot of the Homemaker decorating kind of background.  And and and I kind of make the joke that when I was growing up my mother like to get married and divorced a lot. So we sold a lot of houses and moved a lot. So there was the constant that and then when I got married which was I was 19 when I got married and I'm still with my husband and he was in the Navy we moved 12 times in 15 or 16 years of service. So again, it was buying and selling a lot of houses. So it just kind of became ingrained when  Show was on I found it fascinating and really believe that I could actually do that for a living and that I mean it's not a is uncommon story. But at the same time there's a big jump between working for somebody and starting your own business. Was that a scary kind of transition? It wasn't I've been also have had entrepreneurial seeds my whole life when I was in elementary school my mother who had been an ad Specialties at that time had on her own business.  - and then as I got older she owned her own fo business faux painting business that she'd always had that in. I'd like she would give me things to play with and inevitably I would find myself selling them at school and I've never had a hobby in my life. I don't think that I didn't find some way to turn it into an income generating source. And when I was a stay-at-home mom with my husband a Navy, I would create crafts and sell them. This is before online. So is like a lot of crap.  Shows and craft booths and things like that. So I've never had a hobby that I didn't turn into a business. So having a business was fairly seamless. I was fortunate that my husband made enough money that we didn't need the income. I had been a stay-at-home mom until all of my kids went to school and I really only went to work because I was bored as my I'm not a very good cleaner and house maker. I'm a good I was a good mom, and I enjoyed that part but once like the cook when it's it just came down to cooking and  Cleaning I was done fair enough. So give us a bit of context about drive home staging which is your business today your sit as you said your second home staging company. So any kind of numbers that you can share to give that context a number of has a stage per year level of stock employees Revenue anything like that that you willing to share sure. So we have 22 employees right now. We do typically anywhere from sin 7 to 10 vacant stagings per week.  Then equal a number of D stagings. Universally we can do up to about 20 jobs between the two a week and we very commonly have the calendar very full. We do this year. We're on target for 1.25 million in gross revenue for the year. Last year was our was our fifth year in business and we capped out at just over a million dollars. So good steady growth. We actually could grow faster, but it's a matter of being  Be able to say profitable in the business and make not have to put more money into the business to buy more inventory. That's a conversation. I mean firstly congratulations. It's a, you know, a great achievement and such a significant business. Obviously, it's something that a conversation we have a lot and look the home staging industry is probably a little bit newer in Australia. There's certainly been people or businesses for quite a long time, but it's definitely the last few years like a lot of  Emerging businesses starting up and so the conversation of how do I grow my business and invest in inventory and be able to do the work that's coming in at the same time as remain profitable and be able to afford to actually run the business. So it's one of those conversations and I kind of stayed over over and over is that growth costs money and also know when you're starting a business you don't appreciate what that means until you know, you're a couple of years in and and it's a lot of the time it's about that controlled growth and and knowing what  What growth you want to achieve and what that's going to cost and had a balances with as you say the profitability side, right? I think that if I had enough Capital behind me right now which for us would probably be about another quarter of a million dollars. Then I could probably raise us from 1.25 million to 3 million in about 18 months, but I don't have that quarter of a million sitting behind me. So it's it is about the sustainable growth and still making a profit.  So I've chosen not to in the in the five and a half years. We've been in business. I've chosen never to take a distribution from our company. I do get paid a salary, but we neither me nor my business partners have ever taken a distribution. We put it all back into the business and that's what has fueled the growth. Excellent. I'm going to change text a little bit. You recently gave a keynote speech and you're a bit of a speaker and you're well-known for those that haven't seen go and have a look at or Google Rave home staging.  You know the kind of come across you I think on Facebook and through some of the Facebook groups and I can see that you put out a lot of videos a lot of content, which I'm going to ask you about in a second. But this is a one of the things you do is a lot of speaking and the recent keynote. I saw at the International Association of home staging professionals conference where you were kind of reflecting on the growth of your business that you just mentioned into a million dollar business. There's a few things in their particular that I really was hoping to get you to kind of talk about because I think  they really resonated with me and probably with a lot of my audience. So the first one was in made a comment that when you think about marketing you think that educational content is key. So can you tell me practically what that means for your business in terms of you the content that you're putting out and kind of why you think that way sure so I'm a big fan of Gary vaynerchuk Gary Vee. I don't know if you've ever listened to his podcast you speaking to an I'm a convert. I'm obsessed. Yeah, so my I listen to them all the time.  And I've been doing educational marketing since I got into business so long before I ever heard him speak long before his book ever came out. His first book ever came out. I have been that that's how we've grown. Every business is really by getting in front of our ideal clients and teaching them what we wanted them to know and how to best use our services. And so I think that's important and today I think that it's the wave of the internet  Set and the internet that's that's driving new customer acquisition and and letting the homeowners individuals know the benefits and value. I don't know how it is in Australia, but here in the US I have found that the state will teach a realtor the laws of selling real estate and the broker will teach the realtor how to build a pipeline of customers. If the agent is lucky the broker will teach that but no one really tells the  Actually how to sell a house how to sell the product they've been given to merchandize into market and so they're really the agent's job really as far as they understand. It isn't to sell the house. It's too it's to build a customer base and I think there's kind of a problem with that because if you build a customer base and you don't sell the product then then your customers are going to be happy, right? So for me, I make it a point to teach agents how to sell a house and that  It goes beyond just the staging and the preparation part but it's to teach in the things that I actually know from Real Estate as well things that I understand about the buyer psychology and the seller psychology and how things translate from that how when a buyers looking online when they're looking through. What did you say realestate.com is what your yeah, I'm or Diana or whatever it is for your site's when they're looking through their to understand the buyer psychology that if they don't like the first five photos.  They're not going to move on to the 6th 7th and 8th. So those first five photos have to be key really understanding and researching all of those all of that data and turning that into something that's teachable and coachable and then teaching them how to use our staging Services as an addition to that so they could actually make the most of what the content the very little bit of content they are producing. So they're getting the most buyer leads and then the most referrals and I guess when you think  about it educational and I think that's a good way to put it you're teaching how you know a realtor or even a client out there that how to use your services. I guess another or another arm of the educational piece could be and for us I guess so the difference is in our Market a little bit. So we often deal directly with clients in some cases. Although a lot of the work still comes referrals through real estate agents, but I guess when we're talking about education some of what we like to put out ourselves is  Teaching people how to do the staging themselves with some of the pieces that they have now, that doesn't mean that we're trying to say you don't need a home Stager. But what it means is that some people are going to be limited on budget. Some people were never going to use this anyway, but it builds a trust with agents. It builds trust with the clients who will often get us in for a consult anyway, and some of them do decided to do it themselves, but more often than not people will take the advice and then decide that I want to do it themselves and they'll get they'll bring us into to do it for them.  Anyway, so I think you know, I don't know your thoughts on that, but from an educational point of view, we found that to be quite successful as well. And we do that as well. And we also produce videos that help other stagers and other areas. So we've done videos on marketing videos for other stagers and that are on our YouTube channel and then we've also done videos like I think one of the two of the most popular videos we have would probably be good for a home owner or agent or another stage or in another area.  To learn like the fact that the shower curtain should always be open during showings and how that creates a different perception for buyers in a different buying experience for the shower curtain to be open and particularly in the bath the non Master bathrooms, and then another one is if you've got a window and around like a bay window in a round table that the chairs should be on an x pattern not a plus pattern and the visual differences and psychological differences.  That those different configurations make definitely and and it's interesting because we do something similar in terms of the content. We put out here. We we put it out for all sorts of different Target markets and one of them as you say is for other stages, so some of the content we put out I think our most popular video was a recent one where it sounds click baby, but it's exactly what I went through in the video was how much can you make as a home staging business and obviously that you know, if you're a running it or you're new to the industry or you've got a small  Your own that's going to be of interest. So it's and it wasn't a this, you know, it was more about this is what we've found and here's some percentages that are kind of General in nature and all that sort of stuff. But it's I think different content for different audiences is important and you don't have to stick to just the one  Now I agree and I think that you know, you know, you mentioned that you really do more for the individual homeowner versus the agent for us. We a lot of our content can go across board too many different Target audiences. But what we focus on is I'll say the low-hanging fruit. I want to our biggest customer base is actually flippers. So it's what we do the most for and that's because we have flippers that do a hundred and fifty houses a year, and I'd rather have one customer.  That does a hundred and fifty houses a year then, you know 10 customers that do 15 and you know a hundred and fifty that do one because it's a lot easier in the end to keep the customer happy and if something goes wrong and they one time, you know, they know that that's not your standard right that things happen and this isn't their first experience with you. So we tend to go after customers who have multiple properties to give us throughout a year and that makes things  It's really a lot smoother. It doesn't mean that we won't take the one off customer but we're not going to really spend marketing dollars towards that we're going to spend our money our biggest marketing dollar toward the customer that's going to give us the most Roi. Yeah, I think that's a good point. Especially I mean not especially but for those that are new to the business and it's always a question. How do I win more work for the those that are new to the industry and it's an important Point like the low-hanging fruit are for us as well. It's going to be agents who can refer, you know five.  And 15 jobs a month and if you're a brand new business in the industry that can be a huge growth opportunity for you. So I agree there next one. I had there was and you can fact check this for me. But as I understand that your pricing is it's different than anything. I've seen at least in Australia. It's based on the list price of the house that you're staging so percentage of that. So tell me about how you use it. So, how do you think about that? Why do you do it that way? And I guess talk a little bit about if if it's been that way.  Right from the start or if you had to kind of transition people and it's an educational piece because it's is it are you the only ones who do what I guess in your Market or is it something that's a bit more common? I think since people have seen the success of our pricing model that it is picking up in the industry. I've heard of more and more people doing it for many years. We were the only ones doing it and we were absolutely told by everybody not to do it that way. So, you know, sometimes you just have to throw caution to the wind and say nope. I think this is a good plan for me. It happened.  Because it wasn't that way in our business in Charleston that company we we had a different pricing structure model, which I'll say was really much more random. It kind of was how big does the house how much Furniture do we think we're going to need like it really was kind of pulling a number out of the sky and this way when we have repeat clients. What we really wanted was a formula that they would that the a if we were working with an agent or a flipper that they could know.  Before the listing how much it would cost to Stage. So for a flipper our main client, they're probably 80% or more of our business for a flipper. They could actually win they were calculating how much it was going to cost to put the house, you know in the repairs and and upgrades that they could calculate the cost of staging into that. So there was no at the end what we didn't know staging was going to cost that much. So that was part of it being able to have that formula and then for realtors when they're taking the listing and they're bringing  Aging into the conversation for them to have a very clear number that they can an expectation that they could give their homeowners. And so that really established us that it wasn't. Well. Let's see how much staging was it was something that they could wrap their brains about the process and the cost and for homeowners the individual homeowner now as opposed to The Flipper what have you they could see that pretty well as they were paying Realtors a percentage of list.  Price so we kind of fit right into that industry model. And with that we decided we didn't want to be a rental company. It wasn't we weren't going to charge by, you know, our quote says, you know a sofa two chairs anybody 10 rug coffee table blah blah blah and then when we came in decided, you know what it would really be better if we had two sofas instead of a sofa and two chairs and change that model and then I'm saying well doesn't that cost less or cost more or you know question the pricing?  That we gave them because we had given them a list of what we were going to bring in and charging a rental fee off of that. So we didn't want anything to do with that. And and so the it kind of change we did we also have an option to pay a closed which most staging companies don't offer. They need that liquid now in order to do their in order to do the staging and we tacked on an additional half percent to our quote. So instead of one percent  It was one and a half percent and since then we've actually changed it to our staging fees are one and a half percent. But if you pay upfront we give you a discount of 20% So we've actually sort of raised our prices from one to one-and-a-half knowing that a lot of people who were we were attacking on that half percent tried to talk us out of it. Now everybody wants to pay us upfront because they want the discount and that's I just want to focus on something you said that because you said it and it's something that we've thought about it.  I think it's it's brilliant and it's it's the psychology thing. It's a way it's a the way that you worded it because we have a what we call a stage now pay later. So it's a similar sort of thing. It's not pay it close, but it's in essence. It's a deferred payment option and there's two ways that you can go about this. And the first one that a lot of people have spoken about is they have their fee for upfront payment and that's the default and if you want to defer payment there's a percentage added on like you said, there's a premium or an extra.  Just the the alternative way, which is what you've transitioned to is and this is what we do. We have our deferred payment option as our default. And then if you want to pay up front, there's a discount now the numbers are exactly the same but people don't like the word premium they like to a discount and and it's not changing anything. Other than the way you actually talk about it. So I think I just want to highlight that because I think you've mentioned something that we stumbled on and I think it's a really clever way of going about it.  Yeah, and and you know, we explore different pricing options all the time right now for the fall. We have a different pricing structure going on as we're one of the things that's our happens a lot in our Market is we are absolutely a premium staging service. But we've noticed that a lot of the last volume us flippers and our Market have started hiring another staging company that provides a really low cost and  Lie, low cost all say and we've created a pricing structure that actually sort of almost matches them, but it's only month to month. So when you're looking at the two numbers side by side, we're probably about 25 percent more than their pricing quote. But in the long run will actually turn our furniture faster and make more money, even though it sounds like we're making a lot less upfront. Okay, very interesting.  Ting and instead, I don't think it's something I've seen in Australia in terms of that processing model is up centage of list price, but I think it's very interesting and one of the comments you made when you spoke about this in your in your keynote was and I'm trying to remember the exact quote. But you said how would you like to never have prices and objection again? And I think everybody in this industry can relate to that. Basically what we're looking at is that we never have to go out to a house and preview a house with out the customer already having it.  Having approved the pricing. So we're only going to go out there to ease their mind if you will, but they've already agreed to our pricing structure. So we're not wasting any time. But before we kind of get to that and they've called us usually the initial comments on the phone are either how much the staging cost or I have X budget and what can I get for that and we started backtrack the conversation and really give them our value pitched because again up to  80% I'm sorry over 80% of our customer base. Our flippers were able to really have good conversations with them about what kind of return on that investment. They're seeing investors. Don't do a lot of expenses if they're not going to get a return out of it. And so universally we've heard that they find that they're getting typically about 10 percent more for the property when they staged it then when it's left out in stage. So in our Market because  Our Market is sort of a very low-end Market if it's a 250 thousand dollar house. That means that there when they staged the house they're thinking they're going to get about 25 thousand dollars more for that house by staging it then leaving it empty and that's a big number. So when we're talking to our customers, we don't actually say 10% more because we don't want them psychologically going crazy and raising the price so high that they can't sell it, but we're going to let them know that  Turn should typically be three to five times what they're spending even though our even though our customers tell us. It's closer to 10% So when we look at that what we're saying is if you have a $250,000 house at one percent because it's really what we're looking for. That's going to be a 25 hundred dollar investment that you should expect to get $7,500 or more out of that at closing and so when we explain that  Then typically we don't get as much like if all you're concerned is about spending $2,500. You're not our customer if you're concerned about how much my getting back. Is this an expense or is this an investment then are your our customer base? So once we establish that then we're happy to meet with them and do whatever we need to to secure the deal, but we're never going to waste time and house where we haven't already secured the knowledge of what our pricing is. We're never going to  Get out to a house on the go. Oh, I had no idea what it cost so much. I think I mean you basically qualifying Elites in a way. And as you say there are there are people who aren't going to be your customer and without having that expectation of price upfront often. You'll get a call to go and look at a house or give a quote when they were never your customer to begin with. So I really like it and I think people should think about that we thought about a version which we're looking into which is not a percentage necessarily but fixed pricing and we  Of you know a number of the say three or four different fixed prices, depending on what size house or something. Yeah, we're still looking into things like that. But but the point would be more of a way to give an expectation of cost before they actually turn up or before they call us for us. The fixed price Model doesn't work because we focus in a lot on demographic staging. So who's the most likely buyer for this house and our because of where we are in Florida, we have Beach beachfront properties.  And then we have very rural properties. And so you might have a $200,000 house that very rural that is 4,000 square feet. So you got to bring in a lot of furniture and then you might have a $600,000 beach house. That's 1,200 square feet and you don't have to bring them very much Furniture, but it has to be super quality, you know, so package pricing doesn't like we staged the entire house all of the rooms all of the interior square footage, so  For us when we tried to calculate like well, if it's this price point that's this multiple and blow out the easiest and the end was the percent and there's some we win and there's some we lose but overall we make a good profit fair enough. I'm going to try and get through a couple questions reasonably quick look. So now I'm taking up some of your time probably the favorite probably the thing. That was my favorite comment that you mentioned in that recent video was  How a lot of the stages in the market use what you call pretty talk and I think this is I've written this down because it was a direct quote that I really liked. You said. We don't make houses pretty we make them marketable pretty as a side effect of what we do. Can you talk to that a little bit? Oh, I love this is like my favorite Topic in the whole wide world. I absolutely get hostile sometimes listening to stagers talk about what they do from a design rated related platform. We need to use good  Design principles with what we're doing, but ultimately this goes back to that demographic thing. We need to understand who is buying the product and then when we understand who is buying the product then we need to figure out how they're going to use that product. So this is and this is kind of the example that I give for people to really understand if you were if you decided to set up a store and you were going to sell school supplies, wouldn't it be important to know whether you  Wanted to sell college school supplies or Elementary School supplies, right? Because if you just said, hey, I want to sell school supplies and you open up a school supply store that geared things towards elementary school kids and you opened up next to the college. You probably aren't going to sell very much, right? And yeah, absolutely and I guess, you know, I'm not a stage. I'm not a stylist or of any sort of design bones in my body. I'm the business.  Operator I'm with my wife and she's the chief stylist in our team. And we've got a team of stylists. So from my point of view, I've said this before but when I look through Instagram and we kind of obviously we look at all of our competition and the other stages around Australia and yourself and others in around the world from my point of view as somebody who isn't a stylist. Everybody looks the same and that's not trying to be critical of anybody staging but I just don't understand the the the small details that make a difference.  Since I'm not the person who is going to know that and I think I in some ways relate more to the buyer that maybe what the stylist does so you have to understand that somebody else looking at this from the outside who doesn't look at different homes every single day. They're not going to know the difference and a comment that you made which I agree with is if all we do is we look the same and we all say the same thing which is generally everybody says we sell for more and we sell faster if we're if that's what everybody is saying. It makes sense that somebody would go for a cheaper option. Absolutely.  And so like we classify this that for for us the definition of staging is that staging creates a measurable marketable change and the perceived value of the property. Yes. I love that everything. We do focuses first on that. We do not make a single recommendation in the house unless we believe that recommendation will make a perceived value change in the house. It has to be measurable and  has to be marketable or forget about it. I'll never forget I used to have in my business in Charleston. I had a stage where my team and he was a little bit of a diva and he'll be like I see this bookcase with all white accessories and I'm like, that's great David. Do we have all white accessories for you? And he's like no you need to buy me some and I'm like, okay. Well tell me is that a design decision or is it actually going to change the perceived value of the property to the buyer?  And he would just kind of stare at me blankly and be like it's a design decision and I'm like great the news what we have right because we're not I mean we do want pretty pictures. We do want it to be favorable with MLS, but I can do that without all-white accessories, right? I can do that in other ways and I'm going to spend money on the property if somebody tells me they need a desk because there's this space here. That's an awkward space and really it's, you know, maybe even a hallway and  It really could be an office, you know a nice little simple office then then and he we don't have the right shape or Dimension desk in stock. I'm going to go buy a new desk to fit in that space because I'm going to bring value to that property. I'm going to create an extra room or an extra usable marketable space for them. That's that's going to make a difference to the potential buyer. And so I will do that and we do that like Ana Landings and things like that giving the buyer.  Ideas of how to use a space that otherwise otherwise might be empty useless space and when we can do that and we can pop open their eyes and say, ah now I see how I can live here. That's when they're going to emotionally connect with the property and that's when they're going to pay more money for it. It's not about making the house pretty it's not about knowing where the sofa goes, but it is about creating a lot of the visual perception of a lot of space.  A lot of usable space in the way that they would live. I agree a hundred percent. I don't think I've got anything to add to that. You said it very well. Let's move on from that talk. And as I said before for those that would like to say I think it's about a 40-minute cannot that you gave so for those listening go and check it out but a couple of final questions, so if you could click your fingers going back to being the business owner, click your fingers and instantly change one thing about  about your business. What would it be? Oh, wow. That's a tough one. I am going to say that.  Maybe a current frustration. Yeah, I think that I wish that I would have hired another me sooner and what I mean by that is we've got a great team, but I'm we've just finished. We actually just had our big Mark our big meeting today finishing up the book traction and about sort of replanting the business for the new year and we're actually looking at potentially franchising in another year here in the states. And the one thing I think I really waited too long.  Long on that we've just changed but like now I feel like I'm under such the gun for him to catch up is hiring an operations manager that I've been really good about delegating things that I'm not competent with if I'm if I like I don't like the money part of it. I mean, I like I like data I like numbers, but I'm just not good at the money part the schedule, you know paying the bills and all that all the time. So I need somebody else to do that because I get distracted by  Other bigger projects and I hired a sales manager because I don't like networking and I hired other stagers and assistance because I couldn't do it all I knew that we needed to get more done. We hired our own in-house movers and so on and so forth, but the one position that I didn't that I didn't replace until just recently and I feel like we should have done it a year sooner is an operations manager and that's because for the last year plus I have spent.  All my time working in the business and not on the business. And now that I have somebody taking that that responsibility I'm starting to see things are becoming more efficient in the business and I'm able to actually build out the future of the company. So I think that's maybe the one thing that I would snap my fingers and and go back a year and hire hire somebody to get that in place sooner. I like that answer. It's you know, it's a cliche but working on business.  Not in the business. I think that's especially for the new businesses in this industry or any industry. But you know, it's it is a bit of a trap when you're the especially I mean what for us personally, you know what my wife being the chief stylist. She started the company from The Styling point of view and she's now building out her team but she still very involved in a lot of things and that's just that's what happens when you start a small business and you're the you're the person and I think for the you know for for my thought on that it doesn't have to be another  another operations manager, but you know just on the if you're finding that things aren't getting done that you're spending too much time in the minutiae like it's time to look at what minutiae can I get rid of and it took a long time for me to realize the minutiae I needed to get rid of was actually operations that I didn't need to control all of that and I think part of that question is asking yourself. What am I like so what am I the best start and where do I add the most value and for a lot of people in this starting out in the early days?  You're kind of wearing every hat you doing everything but there comes a point where you have to start saying some of these things could be done better by somebody else and I shouldn't be doing them anymore and not being afraid to hire somebody better than you. Yep. Absolutely. All right last couple of questions here. What would you say has been the most difficult thing you've had to deal with and that can be from a business point of view or personal point of view as the owner. What kind of comes to mind starting over when I sold my business in  In Charleston and we moved to Jacksonville. I did not plan on starting over. I plan on getting out of the industry. And the truth is I love it. It's in my blood and we moved because my husband had a job that he couldn't say no to and I had been sick for a year on bed rest for over eight months. And so it made sense for us to move and I just didn't coming off of that. I didn't think that I would get back into it and feeling the Pains of knowing what a great company you can have but not knowing anyone and literally.  Having anything not having a warehouse not having a move or not having an assistant not having a thing going from having it all to having none of it. That was very eye-opening. I think the great advantage that I had their though was I literally got to look at my business and say if I had it to do all over again, what would I change and then made those changes?  You just a question that kind of came to mind. How do you think of yourself when somebody says what is your role or what are you doing? Do you think of yourself as a Stager or you an operator had it? How do you think about that? I'm an entrepreneur brilliant. I like it. No more needed. All right, let's just finish up with a couple of rapid-fire questions. And these are their rapid questions. The answers can be as long or as short as you like. So the first one how has a failure or and what seemed from the outside maybe to be a failure. How is that?  Set you up for later success.  That's a good question. Um, I think that I so so here's a funny funny little story and I'll try to keep it super short is when I worked for the real estate office and I was the office manager. We were getting ready to move into a brand-new beautiful shiny new construction giant building and I kind of went from being the manager who sat behind the reception desk answering the phones and greeting people to where  I would have my own office with the glass door and my own team and staff and I literally four weeks sat and thought about was I willing to give up that status of you know, having that glass door with my name on it to quitting my job and going after something else even though I love my job, but I hated my boss and and I laugh at that now there was another moment where  I was afraid to spend $50 a month when I was starting to make the commitment of a year contract for $50 a month for Constant Contact a newsletter service and that first year that newsletter service. We we could count $100,000 worth of Direct business that we got from that newsletter. I think things like that failures of worrying about what other people would think or you know was I willing to make kind of big  It meant without any anything there to to fall onto and and I think in the end I did push myself into a very uncomfortable place and it was those that that really uncomfortable place that ends up having all value and all the reward.  Okay, another one. What is one of the best or most worthwhile Investments that you've made and that can be in the form of time money energy anything that you like having somebody that I could rely on to unquestionably do the business for me. So if I and for me that started off being an assistant who now actually five years later runs manages five other.  Stagers and five other assistance so she's got a team of 10. So she started off as my assistant and and really deciding that even though I didn't think I could afford it yet hiring somebody to start taking some of that load off my plate. Okay. I like it. That's very relevant to us right now. What advice do you wish you'd received when you start it out either in your first or second business.  Get out of your own way.  Okay, thank I mean and what I mean by that is I know that sounds cliche but we I am a control person. I'd like to control things. I am not a micromanager, but I do like to have control and sometimes the right answer is really just letting go and and seeing if you've done a good job and and see what happens with the aftermath and I'm going to relate that back to Gary Vee he says often.  Is building out his giant marketing firm or agency and he says five people's 90% is better than your 100 and I think that's an important Point as you're growing. You have to let go a little bit. Absolutely. Okay, probably I'm going to say I was going to ask you a bad piece of advice for the industry, but I think we've kind of touched on that a little bit. So some of the ways I will skip that one. But so let's just finish up with this which is a bit of a simpler one. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?  Of so, we want to know how we do you can be I love watching any show that has to do with psychology and so in sometimes in an odd way, so like I like drug rehab shows because I like to see the psychology of how they overcome their incidents. I like like Millionaire Matchmaker. I don't even know that still on TV and I like Sister Wives. So I love watching how people  Think and respond to things.  Okay. Well, that's all I had but I lied there's one more question and this is the simplest of a lot for those that aren't already following you or seen your stuff. What is the best way that they can have a look at what you've got going on as they put a lot of video content level lot of content including videos. So where's the best place that they can find you? So the best place to look is anywhere on social media for a trave home staging so YouTube Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn wherever if you just follow it if you look up Brave home staging.  That's where we're going to be. We're pretty much everywhere. I actually just recently hired a digital marketing manager. So she's really pushing it out and we have it had a video videographer on staff. So I would like to ask you a question if that's okay. Yeah hit me so I would like to know what biggest challenge that you have in Australia as far as getting your message out like how is how but what are your big tackles?  For your business and Australia, you know, I think if you if you'd asked the question, maybe a couple of years ago the answer for most people would be education and acceptance of home staging back then especially as I said before you're the last couple of years. It's definitely growing as an industry. It's more accepted in agency circles. So that probably would have been the answer. I don't know that that is still the answer anymore. I think in terms of us getting our message out there.  Don't know if it's a difficulty as such but as an industry we tend to we struggle putting ourselves out there. I think I don't know if that's a easy answer but a lot of people speaking to you and what we're trying to do here at Foxy. We are trying to put out a lot of content. We have a marketing or media person in house, and he was one of our first six people because we very early on committed to wanting to put out a lot of content. And so I think we're trying to do it do it in a way that we  Sells out there just educational content and behind the scenes and all sorts of stuff. But I think as an industry it seems to me that a lot of people are struggling with I guess convincing themselves that firstly that's worth it finding the the money or the cost all the time to do that and just kind of take a step back and you know, it's a judgment thing. I think to some degree people don't want to put themselves out there or have themselves on camera. So I think in terms of building a brand building a business reputation  And getting known I think that's probably the thing that people are struggling with the most. Well, you know what, I love about your behind-the-scenes content if I may for a moment is that and we do a little bit of it here as well is when you show people like in the beginning its the value proposition is spending this money worth it and they think it's a large sum of money because to them it may be but really it's that they just see it as Furniture in a house. I think when you do the behind-the-scenes footage as you've been doing it really shows what  Work goes into this that for us, we've got a curate all of that stuff that goes in the house, right? We've got to go shopping and get it all done. And even when it's in the warehouse It's then it's still picking it, you know doing the measurements picking it out for the specific cows that it's going into and and the thought processes behind it so that they're paying us for our skill set and our understanding of the market not just our ability to make a pretty house, you know, kind of took that battle through a conversation earlier.  Earlier, right? And I think you're behind the scenes footage does a great job of portraying how much work and stress and frustration. Sometimes it really takes to get this job done and why you're worth every penny that you charge. Yeah. I think it's something you said before as well. We're not a Furniture hire company. I think that's a very important mindset to have and that that fits in directly with what you were just saying and and how we then portray that to people outside of our own business.  That they think of it as just about the furniture and we really have to Showcase that it's not the furniture that makes the stage. It's the knowledge and the stagers head. Brilliant. All right, I think that's a brilliant place to to finish up Melissa. I very much appreciate you coming on. Hopefully those listening got a lot of out of it, I which I'm sure they will and will drop you a message if they have a look at your your stuff on social media as you mentioned and yeah, let's I'm looking forward to following  A long as you say you've got a lot more growth coming controlled growth, and I'll be watching along and and I'm sure we'll talk again soon, and I'll be watching you on YouTube as well. Thank you so much for having me. Thanks.

Today is Tuesday December 10th 2019 on this day in 1934. Tony Mancini began his trial for the Brighton trunk murders, but the crime itself was bound to another eerily similar murder. Mancini had secured a shark of a lawyer but proving his innocence of the second crime would be an uphill battle.  well  Welcome to today and True Crime app are cast original due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for listeners under 13. Today. We're covering the trial of Tony Mancini a 26 year old Brighton, man, who was charged with killing his lover investigators found her decomposing body in his luggage trunk.  She was using as a coffee table. Let's go back to mid morning on December 10th 1934 as Tony Mancini arrived at the Lewis assizes Courthouse.  Norman birkett waited at the door for his client looking for a lanky man with sunken eyes. Finally Mancini appeared his dark hair slicked back the combination of the hair and downturned snarl made Mancini appear rather smug, especially for someone about to be tried for the gruesome incident known as the second Brighton trunk murder, Tony, man.  Knee didn't care. He would stand by his story. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time a petty criminal with a slew of charges on his record and little money to his name. Mancini was lucky to have Norman birkett backing his claims a distinguished attorney and politician berkut would go on to serve as an alternate British judge during the Nuremberg trials despite his skill berkut had his work cut out for  Or him with mansion he's case. All of Brighton was already convinced that his client was guilty. The crime had become all too familiar that summer and unidentified dismembered woman had been packed into two separate luggage trunks. The appearance of the trunks was ghastly and unexpected. They seemed to proliferate out of thin air in the Brighton and Kings Cross Railway.  Shannon's in June of nineteen thirty four now the two crimes were indelibly linked at least in the minds of the public the likelihood of two different murders with a penchant for packing their victims into trunks seemed unbelievable. But Burke it was willing to wager that he had enough evidence to prove his client was only guilty of one thing hiding violets body.  That meant convincing the jury that someone else killed her.  Burkett had a good idea of how to do this. He just had to prove Violet was a drug user and that her drug usage had killed her the facts did suggest that Violet used drugs a pathologist confirmed that there were high levels of morphine in her body at the time of death. This was the perfect setup Burkett argued that the steps of Mancini and violets 44 Park Crescent Apartment.  Aunt were steep enough to kill someone had she Fallen while on drugs. Yes. He admitted there was no skirting the fact that Mancini took violets dead body put it in a trunk and kept it in his apartment for six months, but Burkett emphasized his clients rattled emotional state when he found violets body. He was overwhelmed he panicked.  Still the prosecution demanded to know why Mancini didn't call the authorities and six months was a long time to live with a rotting body Mancini explained where the police are concerned a man who's got convictions never gets a square deal. He simply didn't trust the authorities not to turn the case around on him. So Mancini said, he packed violets body.  To a trunk and then when he moved a few days later paid a handyman to help him move the trunk to bolster up the idea that Mancini was simply a suspicious perhaps dim-witted man rather than a murderer berkut pointed out to the jury that the clothes Mancini was wearing when he moved Violet were purchased after she was dead. He clearly moved her. Yes, but only after she died.  And there was absolutely no evidence that he committed murder Burke had hoped this evidence was enough to corroborate Mancini story, but the jury didn't look quite convinced.  Coming up. We'll see what verdict the jury had in store for Tony Mancini.

On December 10 1934 Tony Mancini went on trial for killing his girlfriend with a hammer. The evidence was stacked against him. Her body was found in a trunk at his apartment where it had been rotting for six months, but he had an excellent lawyer on December 14th, the jury left the courthouse to deliberate they returned two hours later with a verdict.  Only Mancini would walk free. He was not guilty.  During the 40 years following Tony Mann Chinese trial the trunk murder seemed to sink into brightens sordid past but the first trunk murder remained especially haunting though. It was deemed unrelated to that of violet K. Neither that woman nor her killer were ever identified the crime quietly crept out of public discussion, but in 1976, it was brought back to Center Stage.  Tony Mancini was 68 and in ill health he decided it was time to tell his story. He sat down with British tabloid News of the World and sparing no detail Mancini described exactly. What had happened that day in May of 1934.  Violet had confronted him while he was at work at the Skylark Cafe the argument escalated and violet accused Tony of cheating on her. She stormed off Witnesses suggest. She may have been drunk at the time that evening the mood remained tense when Tony returned home to the apartment. They shared at 44 Park Crescent Violet and Tony bickered fiercely reigniting their earlier row.  Violet again demanded an explanation from Tony about whether or not he was seeing a young waitress at the cafe. He fired back calling her jealous the two came to blows when Violet picked up a hammer near the fireplace. She threatened Tony with it. He charged towards her the two struggled finally Tony Pride the weapon out of her hands unwilling to stop there kada man.  Ended the hammer back taking her words. Literally Mancini through it the hammer collided with violets Temple and killed her instantly. It was here that Mancini is account to the news of the world reporter began to match the story. He had told the court room 40 years before he packed violets body into the luggage trunk then waited a few days until  He was able to move Apartments next he hired a handyman to help him transport the trunk the two men wield the massive case out the back of 44 Park Crescent to a new apartment at 52 Kemp Street about a 15-minute walk. Mancini stoled the trunk and tried to lay low.  But it was only a matter of time Violet who was a sex worker was noticeably absent from the neighborhood where she often picked up clients and Brighton police were still searching for the killer of the unidentified woman of the first trunk murder. They thought this could be a lead the authorities brought Tony in for questioning, but he adamantly denied that the dead woman in question could be Violet. He assured them that Violet had  In for a job in Paris. Additionally he reminded them that Violet was 42. The unidentified woman was around 25 and Pregnant Tony was released and the police dogged Lee continued their search door-to-door investigations began canvassing homes individually was time intensive, but they had no leads when the police knocked on the door of 52 Kemp Street in  June there was no reply but a painter working on the Block had complained of a putrid stench wafting from the building. They forced their way in and found a black leather trunk. The trunk was covered with cloth serving as a makeshift coffee table. However, the smell was undeniably emanating from the table and the pool of unidentified liquid seeping.  The trunks bottom they opened the trunk to find the body of violet Kay.  The headline I got away with murder went out to the world, but Mancini died soon after and the case was never reopened still the confession did reignite a more general public interest in the trunk murders. It added fuel to brightens unfortunate nickname the Queen of slaughtering places. Orson Welles created his own dramatic take on the crime for a radio broadcast in 1951.  And the 1993 play trunks borrowed from the incident as well the narrative embellishments of the Brighton trunk murders though often bypass one sad fact the identity of the first woman whose remains were split between the two trunks found in Railway stations was never determined her killer was never found.

Today is Wednesday, September 11th, 2019 on this day in 1978 writer and broadcaster. Giorgi Markov died of blood poisoning four days after being stabbed with an umbrella. It's now believed this man was assassinated for being an enemy of the Kremlin. Welcome to today and true-crime a par cast original. I'm Vanessa Richardson every day. We tell a timely story from True Crime history, then analyze the historical impact of that day's events due to the graphic nature of today's crimes. Listener discretion is advised. We advise Extreme Caution for children under 13. Now, let's go back to September 11th 1978 to a local hospital. in London  to ER nurses hovered around the reception desk. They were gossiping about the patient in cubicle 3 over the past four days. His condition had declined rapidly. He was seemingly dying of blood poisoning. But what truly made him know worthy was the cockamamie story. He'd been telling his doctors according to the 49 year old patient. Mr. Giorgi Markov. He'd been assassinated by a member of the  The entire Ward had been whispering about him yorgi insisted. He'd been stabbed with a poisoned Dart dislodged from the end of an umbrella. He said he was an enemy of the Kremlin for speaking out against the Communist Party. He claimed that he'd already survived two assassination attempts. But this time he was certainly done for the story was too insane to take seriously a poisoned umbrella.  Le Russian spies know these were the rantings of a Madman with blood disease at the sound of the Flatline the two nurses whipped around and began racing to giorgi markov's hospital bed. He was crashing the ER staff did their best to revive him, but he succumbed to shock  Finally, they were forced to accept that they'd lost him. Giorgi Markov died that morning, September 11th 1978 after four days of fighting infection in the wake of his death. The doctors were left nonplussed. How could a healthy man fall? So Gravely ill so quickly in the investigation that followed however the story would only grow  Stranger as police better learned who giorgi Markov was and who wanted him dead. Giorgi was born in 1929 in Bulgaria and came of age during the second world war which later influenced his writing as a playwright and novelist. He came into some Fame for his work right at the onset of the Cold War but being an artist outspoken about the Communist Party.  He was also a pariah giorgi defected to Italy in 1969 later immigrating to England there. He became a journalist for the BBC and a German news station Deutsche welle as a writer and on are journalists. He was extremely critical of Communism behind the Iron Curtain, especially of Bulgarian Communist party leader todor zhivkov.  His stories of growing up in a communist country both shocked the west and garnered him a huge following in Bulgaria so much so that his broadcasts were credited with fostering dissidents in Bulgaria against the Communist party. Then rumor has it that in June 1977 Communist party leader todor zhivkov ordered a hit on your GE and allegedly requested the cage.  Be to assist him in the assassination. Not only were KGB agents better trained than the Bulgarian spies for such a hit their involvement would also erase any ties to Bulgaria in the year that followed three attempts were made on Georg. He's life the first of these occurred in the spring of 1978 when someone poisoned giyorgis drink at a dinner party, however, he didn't succumb.  Come to the poison then later that summer giorgi left on a vacation to visit family in Sardinia. He was introduced to a Bulgarian agent who told him I've been sent to murder you but I'm not going to do it. I'm going to take the money and vanish.  The news came as a shock to giorgi who quickly shared the info with his publicist and his higher-ups at the BBC. He said he wasn't sure whether the man had been playing a sick joke or if he was being targeted for assassination after all the KGB was not necessarily known for being gentle in their treatment of communist critics, September 7th. 1978 was a crisp autumn morning and just  So happened to be Yogi's birthday. He was on his way to work at the BBC in London and made his way to his normal bus stop on the south side of Waterloo Bridge as he neared the bus stop a sudden sharp pain struck him in the leg. He whipped around to see a man stooped down and pick up an umbrella off the ground the man quickly apologized and kept walking at first he assumed the man had dropped his umbrella and it brushed him as it fell.  Although he did know that when the man apologized his English was heavily accented. It sounded Eastern European given the year. He was having he wondered whether it was a coincidence throughout the day the spot on his leg where the umbrella had nicked him continued to hurt. Then it began to Hitch. Finally. He went to the bathroom to take a look and discovered that a red blotch of skin was growing.  Where the pin prick had been the pain worsened and by evening, giorgi was running a fever. He showed the pinprick to his wife Annabelle who somewhat endearingly said I can't believe people go around stabbing other people with umbrellas, but as his fever worsened Annabelle insisted, he go to the ER to get the pin prick checked out. He was admitted later that night.  At first the local doctors weren't exactly sure what to do with him. The entire thing made no sense the hospital treated him for blood poisoning, but they weren't convinced. That was what was actually causing his fever and pain by this point. Giorgi had had enough time to unpack what had happened that morning when he got to the hospital. He recounted the tail to the ER staff. He told them he believed he had been stabbed in the back of the leg.  With a poisoned umbrella naturally to the hospital staff the theory sounded like an insane conspiracy. They dismissed him out of hand. It should be noted. However that while the hospital staff did not believe that giorgi had been poisoned by Russians it in no way affected the Ardent nests with which they treated him. They did not ignore the red spot on his leg the possibility that poison had entered his bloodstream nor the  The seriousness of his condition the next day September 8 he went into shock again his doctors knew there was something horribly wrong with him. They just had no idea as to what nothing they did seem to improve his condition. They spent the next three days fighting an uphill battle until finally on the morning of September 11th. Giorgi Markov died.  Coming up. We'll try to shed some light on the mysterious death of Georgi Markov now back to today in True Crime.  When 49 year-old giorgi Markov died suddenly on September eleventh nineteen seventy eight doctors initially believed it was of septicemia possibly as a result of kidney failure, but due to the bizarre circumstances and the fact that giorgi Markov was a known figure Scotland Yard began an investigation into this otherwise healthy man's sudden death. They biopsied the skin around the red mark on.  Leg where he had been stabbed and sent it to a chemical weapons Research Institute outside London embedded in his skin. The chemists found a tiny metallic sphere of an unusual composition analysis showed that the metal was a unique Halo alloy capable of holding half a milligram of liquid. The sphere was empty, but the implication was stunning it seemed as though giorgi Markov had not been  In conspiracy theories, he was very likely assassinated further analysis showed that he was likely Poisoned With ricin. This poison was made famous by the television show Breaking Bad and it was Walter White's weapon of choice for good reason. Ricin is easily made more poisonous than Cobra Venom and has no antidote in short from the moment the umbrella struck giorgi skin.  I was a dead man.  Several years after the murder two former KGB officers admitted to the murder their names were Oleg kalugin and Oleg gordievsky both.
