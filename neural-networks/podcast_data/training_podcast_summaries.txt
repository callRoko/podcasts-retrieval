I have had a revolutionary awakening now that I have let go of vices, and I embrace the process of finding and experiencing authenticity.

And we don't notice it doesn't work at all."  - Alison Armstrong How to make the shift from complaining to getting help solving your problems. Breaking down "self care" into something actionable.

Moving onto weening, milk options and more practical parts of a growing child that starts to ask questions and is potentially put in non-vegan situations.  Gemma is a wealth of knowledge and is not only a doctor with her own practice but also brings up her own kids plant-based.

We've all heard that calories matter, and that for weight loss to occur we need to find a way to be in a calorie deficit.  But what if some ways of eating made it easier for this to happen?  This exactly what Rami, a PhD candidate pondered.  And it was his scientific review article that got my attention when he looked at the other benefits of the plant-based diet that makes it easier for someone to lose weight.  These include (1) reduced caloric density, (2) improved gut microbiota symbiosis, (3) increased insulin sensitivity, (4) reduced TMAO, (5) activation of  PPARs, and (6) over-expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Collectively, these factors improve satiety and increase energy expenditure leading to reduced body weight.  Don't worry, we go over what all that means in the podcast.  Here is a link to his review https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717463/ once you have had a listen. And don't forget to give him a follow on Instagram @plantbased_climber 
Get Yael's free Money Dates PDF at jewishlatinprincess.com/moneydate This week I had the pleasure of inviting Yael Trusch, host of Jewish Latin Princess who is sharing the amazing concept of Money Dates. Yael has a background in finance and is now an author and inspirational speaker, so she brings the vision from one world to the practical of the other! Money is one of the main sources of stress for couples, and often we struggle to have these conversations. While the impulse may be to avoid these conversations, Yael shows us how carving out the time actually helps make it easier to discuss money. And it's not just about counting dollars. Yael brings in values, vision, and dreams, and shows us how the way we spend our money can become a reflection of our deepest values. So what's a money date? A money date is specific time you carved out in the calendar to speak about your finances. Yael suggests discussing it on a global level first--what lessons did you learn from your family? How has your experience with money been so far?--and then gradually adding in budgeting, investing, and planning.

Andy is a father, he is newly engaged to Mel who also runs, and his son is an avid runner too. Andy has taught his son that when you try your very best, you have already won the race. Andy found running around the same time he started on a weight-loss journey back in 2014. When Andy started running he weighed around 300lbs, his running journey began with 30 seconds of running 1 minute walking, on repeats and his longer run was a 2km. Andy has since been hooked with running and has now completed some serious mileage and challenges over the years including 30 marathons and 8 ultra marathons, including the Threshold Trail Series’ Race to the Stones 100km Race several times. Andy has also completed some crazy challenges such as 26 Marathons in just one year, 7 Marathons in 7 days oh and a half marathon, on a treadmill!  Tune in to hear exactly how Andy found his love for running; what keeps him motivated; the importance of speaking up about mental health and how running and what it has brought to his life has had such a positive and life changing impact with his mental health.  This was a great chat filled with the lessons learnt along the way, and some brilliant tips on getting started with running, and running the marathon and ultra marathon distances.    Links:  Andy’s Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/chubs2ridgewaylife/  Threshold trail Series  https://www.thresholdtrailseries.com/  Natalie - Not Another Runner Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/notanotherrunner/ Blog: https://notanotherrunner.home.blog/  Easy Thrills Podcast  https://anchor.fm/easythrills Interview with Easy Thrills Podcast https://anchor.fm/easythrills/episodes/Natalie-Hawkins---Not-another-runner-e488pg  
This week's a little different. I'm (James) joined by Justin Vasquez of Elastic Games to talk about how the sudden closure of the Discord Store drastically altered the future of what was meant to one of the shop's flagship titles. Last Year is a 5v1 teens versus monster horror game deeply rooted in B-movie aesthetics, a charming and unique take on asymmetrical competition that I personally prefer to the easy, but not entirely accurate comparison, Dead by Daylight.  But Last Year hasn't had the easiest time standing out. Shortly after launch on the Discord Store, the future of the game was put on the fritz when the shop suddenly closed. The team went dark for months much to the dismay of their busy Discord community, but Elastic Games has since found a new direction and road map for its debut, and more importantly, a new home on Steam.  Vasquez takes me through the moments the Discord Store shut down, the trouble of maintaining healthy communication with a fervent community, keeping up team morale in a difficult time, and the new shape and direction of Last Year.

What a journey Sophia has had already. From struggling with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, being admitted to hospital to finding herself and becoming Commonwealth and European Powerlifting champ, and record holder.  This girl is strong! Inside and out.   Not only can she lift heavy, but she has also been able to share her story and help others. This is what the podcast is all about.   As well as some myth-busting. I would like to try and see someone tell Sophia that you can't grow muscle on a vegan diet, because she is living proof that you can, and then some.  We also cover gym confidence and the importance of asking for help.   This is the kind of podcast that should get you motivated to resistance train but also to love yourself a little more.  I hope you enjoy it!!

One place I especially like to work on is charged relationships. Partly because this is an area where I have had my own work to do, so I know how important it is, but also because we really discover our own thought processes here and they are funny and surprising. Several of you wrote in asking me to discuss sibling relationships. When I put out a request for specific scenarios, they were almost all about sisters-in-law, so we'll focus on that but these tools really can be applied to any relationship. I have a question about my sister-in-law. I desperately want to become friends with her but every time we do something she is constantly on her phone or gossiping about people from her home town that I have no clue who they are. How can I become friends with someone who doesn’t take the time to talk? There are two parts of to any relationship: how they feel about you and how you feel about them.  Which is in your control? We will never know how someone feels about us, and even if we could know, we can’t control it. So I like to have a few thoughts that help me:   I get to feel however I want about you.  I am going to learn something very important from you.   I’m good.   How do I deal with a jealous sister in law who wants to make every moment about her? She wanted to know when I was pregnant, when I gave birth, and gender of baby (I’m assuming she means during the pregnancy) and got jealous of my relationship with my MIL. I don’t have involved parents. Let’s break down what’s happening and how we’re interpreting it. Because our interpretations drive our emotional reaction, so we have to have really high standards about what we’ll allow as “fact.” What happened: she asked if you were pregnant (or asked you to tell her when you were) Thought: She needs every moment to be about her. Feeling: Resentment, annoyance, disgust, sadness… whatever Action: Don’t tell her, maybe try to convey with your tone or body language that you’re offended Result: Less closeness, no pairing of you two, so it remains all about her--there isn’t a relationship instead.  What if you tried on other thoughts here? How would you feel and behave differently? Have some fun with it. I had my son 9 months ago and my SIL got married 6 weeks before us. Lots of tension. I had a great pregnancy and she is now pregnant and I am extremely happy for them. But at the same time I all of a sudden feel a shift in my MIL since hearing the news. I understand it is her daughter and she is pregnant with her second grandchild, but she is seemingly colder towards me… it may be my own insecurities but what if somehow it could be my SIL stirring it up? She is very insecure with my husband and MIL’s relationship. How do you want to show up in the relationship? Create a clear vision for yourself before any family interaction with your in-laws. It is very normal to feel uncomfortable with your in-law relationship. What if you allowed that? What if you didn't try to make it more comfortable, but just went to a place of observing yourself and your reactions and allowing yourself to be uncomfortable?  Want to take this work further?

Mrs. Taylor's English Assignment: Dorian Gray Podcast 1 
This week we're talking about negative emotions in your marriage. It is so common for newlyweds to feel extremely vulnerable and surprised at the number of negative emotions they may be experiencing in their marriages. The trouble with anger, resentment, frustration, and any negative feeling isn't the feeling itself--its the way we react to it. In this episode, we review our understanding of how emotions work, how to have an authentic emotional life (and how it's not all about "feeling all the feels"), and how to allow negative emotions. Many times, we resist negative emotions either by pushing it away with distractions or by switching to a more comfortable emotion like anger or disappointment. I'll take you through this process and give you an exercise to apply this work to your own marriage. (The thought work here is based on the Self-Coaching Model by Brooke Castillo.) 
In today's episode, we're gonna talk about your time and why you don't have enough of it. It's not why you think. I'll share my tool for matching your priorities to your calendar and help you deal with those feelings of busyness and overwhelm that can suck the energy out of all of us.

In the Winter of 1795 and 1796, one of the the Founding Fathers of the United States of America, Thomas Paine, wrote an essay that to this day over two centuries later, remains perhaps the greatest justification of all justifications for unconditional basic income. His argument is founded on the principles of justice, where all human beings are owed their natural inheritance, and the injustice of a civilization that makes some people worse off than what nature would otherwise provide is an injustice that must be rectified. In his words, UBI is a right, not a charity, that will give currency to the principles of revolutions.

The world's 1st Arab-American podcast. 📡Airing out of STL Studios. 📿Connecting Arab-American's through story and discussion.🎙️Fun, meaningful dialogue over unique and controversial stories relating to the Arab community. ___________________________________Okay serious question. 🙋‍♀️  How many of us can say we know what our parents went through?  Leaving a homeland to journey to a foreign nation of foreign values, language, culture and tradition.  Out of necessity for survival.  Do we really understand what that does to a person?  How many of us really know what happened in detail.  Apart from loose stories here and there and how school was uphill both ways.  And how somehow all our Dad's were the toughest kids in the street.  This gap we have here,  between old generation and new.  This missing narrative  can tell us A LOT about why things are they way they are.  Through a shepard of the old generation, Abu Ameer,  we explore our culture and traditions from an experienced perspective  that has seen both sides.  And we try to come to terms with both. 
The cast plays would you rather...plus lots of finger monkeys :)

Join me for a massive overshare into the less boring bits of my life, what I've learnt from them, and how the seemingly negative things that happen can turn into the best if you just wait them out, just like you'll have to wait til the end to hear me drop the c bomb.   00:00 The inspiration behind doing a solo episode and the opportunity to stop listening if you don't particularly want to know too much about me. 01:30 How most of us are just normal people trying to be slightly better at normal things and the importance of using adversity to become slightly less average. 03:10 The least boring parts of my life; ice, sex, and the constant fear of going to hell. 10:00 The constant need to flog dead horses and the importance of quitting while you're ahead.  13:00 Yeah, nah, bye. The transition from piece of shit to art student piece of shit.  16:00 Why spite is an excellent motivational tool, but a genuine passion is essential.  21:00 From food to fitness; the inspiration behind my next career change. 26:00 CrossFit; how being hit by a car turned me into a full CF wanker, plus finding and then losing a surrogate family. 30:00 Entering the world of weightlifting; why I love keeping my clothes on and sitting the fuck down. Discipline, commitment, and falling in love with the process. 33:00 The goal and why I'm OK with not being there yet. 36:00 Making things fucking happen, and why being an annoying c*** is essential to achieving anything.

It's been great hearing stories from listeners about how this is giving you clarity and empowerment as you make decisions about what to do and what to cut.

This one is a little different.   I talk with @bencoomber about his journey so far with Veganuary. Ben is a top guy, and a well known authority in the UK fitness and nutrition industry.   He is extremely open-minded and wanted to give veganuary a proper go this year to get a better understanding of conscious eating and living. I chat to him at the end of week 1 to see how he is finding it. The answer? Not so good.. In fact that is why he reached out so we could troubleshoot some of his feelings of emptiness and fatigue.   This conversation was done via an instagram live, I have also added my own bit at the start to set the scene and an explanation at the end to go over things that I didn't talk abut and why (as I saw a-lot of comments suggesting certain nutrients which wouldn't have been the cause)  Let me know what you think in the comments and tag anyone else who might be struggling with their veganuary (@weareveganuary) efforts

2019 was the year of the podcast at First Year Married (we passed 40k!!!). I’ve been honored to meet you, to have your sisters and friends get hooked, to introduce this work I’m so passionate about. Thank you everyone!!  2020 is going to be the year of group coaching. It’s time to take this work and really dive deep and apply it. Improving our marriages improves every area of our life, and it’s the best place to work on this thought work, which is then a piece of cake to apply elsewhere in our lives.  Group Coaching Details:   NOT just for newlyweds (and therefore I need name ideas)  Monthly focus video  Worksheets and journal pages  Twice monthly calls   Whatsapp group   Sign up at FirstYearMarried.com/course -- all participants get 3 months of group coaching for free, then can continue on from there!  The Marriage You Want. Here's what I hear...    My husband is great but still want a divorce   I don't want a divorce, but he drives me crazy   I'm not showing up how I want, I get in a funk or I'm mean   I'm not measuring up to the wife I have in mind, the one who always has a clean house, makes delicious meals, never gets angry, always feels loving -- even if intellectually I know that’s all ridiculous  Here’s the thing. If you are unhappy in your marriage it's ALWAYS because of your THOUGHTS. Example: husband not helping "If he’d only be more involved... if he’d do what I needed... if he’d tell me to get to bed when I’m obviously falling apart..." So let’s say you cook a delicious dinner. You leave work even though you’d rather stay and finish a few things up, shlep to the store, get all the ingredients from this fancy Pinterest recipe you found, slave in the kitchen, you’re starving because now it’s already 8 PM and he’s come in three times to sniff around… and now he reaches into the cabinet and takes out a box of crackers and sits down on the couch to eat them. Now you’re fuming, you’re resentful, what’s happening here? You're cooking, and he's eating. That's it. This is all about awareness. It really does feel like he’s the problem, I know. And the obvious solution is -- at least in theory -- to switch him out for a newer model. But here’s the thing-- wherever you go, there you are. So even if you ultimately make a choice to end the marriage, even if I give you that, don’t do it because you haven’t taken responsibility for your own feelings. Don’t do it because your brain is running wild and you aren’t paying attention.

Jon has taken on so many challenges and raised money for several different charities and great causes. He is not afraid of a challenge or two.. or should I say 12?!  Listen in to hear how Jon went from starting running to running an ultra, and keeping up a run streak of 212 days as of 30/06/19. Jon has some brilliant advice for starting running, and running an ultra. We get to hear what he thinks has made him so resilient and able to complete such epic challenges such as the "12 for 12 @ 12" - listen in to hear all about this challenge that he found was one of the hardest things he has ever done.   Links: Jon's Instagram https://www.instagram.com/this_man_runs/ Jon's 12 miles at 12 for 12 days  https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/12at12for12?utm_id=26 CALM SITE  https://www.thecalmzone.net/about-calm/what-is-calm/  Not Another Runner Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/notanotherrunner/ Blog:  https://notanotherrunner.home.blog/  Easy Thrills Podcast:  https://anchor.fm/easythrills Easy Thrills Interview with Not Another Runner:  https://anchor.fm/easythrills/episodes/Natalie-Hawkins---Not-another-runner-e488pg  
This week I'm answering a much-asked question: how do I get my husband to help out REGULARLY, not just as "helping" me? We've discussed some of these concepts before, especially in Episode 30 - Just Ask! and Episode 30 - What It Means to Give, Interview With The Husband Part 2, but I've never taken the time to do a full, dedicated episode to this issue. And it really is an issue. The ideas of helping, housework, equally divided responsibility, are all loaded for many of us. And more than that, they strongly play into some of the main differences between men and women.  How is enthusiasm perceived by men vs. women? What motivates men to want to help? Why do we hate to ask for help? Why do we feel threatened if it's not clear that it's all FAIR? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

We talk about the title.  
We take Jesus seriously – so what does that mean? It is important to think about Jesus as a human being in order to help us work out how Jesus wants us to live. What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus? Jesus Christ was a first-century rabbi who taught people how to live on earth. He was entrusted with speaking in the synagogue and at the temple. Let’s look at the calling of the first 4 disciples: Matthew 4:18-22:   As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.  “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”   At once they left their nets and followed him.   Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,   and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.  There are a couple of things to notice about this passage:    They were fishermen.   Jesus’ sales pitch was “Follow me”   4 grown men left everything they knew to follow a random stranger  Then again in Mark 2:13-14: 13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. 14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. Again – the sales pitch is “Follow me” and these grown men are leaving everything to do just that – businesses, family, wives, children - everything. What is happening here? In first century Israel, every boy wanted to be a Rabbi – it was the highest honour. But at the end of the day, only the best of the best went on to become a Rabbi. To be entrusted with the title Rabbi was not something that was done lightly – there are only 3 Rabbis mentioned in the Bible – Jesus, Paul and Gamaliel. In order to be a rabbi, you had to memorise Leviticus by the age of 6. If you did this, you graduated to the next school. The next school was the Bet Sefer – the school of the book – which lasted from age 6-12 and you had to memorise the entire Torah before the age of 12. If you memorised the entire Torah before the age of 12, this qualified you to take the exam in order to progress to the next school. The exam was on your ability to ask questions about the Scripture in order to keep a conversation about God going. Think about the Bible - when Jesus was 12 years old, he was wowing the teachers of the law with his questions. If you wow the teachers of the law with your questions, you then progressed to the next school – the Bet Talmid. Bet Talmid means the school of discipleship and this lasted from 12 years old to 30 years old. The Bet Talmid consisted of 5 stages and you had to graduate from each stage or you were told “I’m sorry, you’re disqualified from being a rabbi, go back and earn a living at your family business”.

This week sharing one of my favorite Jewish ideas, which I was reminded of by a Tony Robbins quote. Who... last I checked... was most definitely not a rabbi 🤣⁠ The word for love in Hebrew is ahava. The root word of ahava is "hav" which means "give." This is here to remind us that the root of love is giving.⁠ What's the last project you truly invested in? ⁠ Didn't you love it?⁠ The more we work, the more we try, the more we love.⁠ And yet we somehow expect our marriages to do all the work for us. As if a marriage is a THING that can WORK. But somehow they should make us happy.... or they're broken.⁠ So this week we're turning it all on its head.⁠ Please join us 💜⁠

You're ready to grow, you're ready to move on to the next level.... but everyone around you is struggling. What's a newlywed to do? How do we improve our lives without leaving those we love in the dust?   Budgeting for newlyweds can be tricky. You might struggle with getting your apartment organized, or your new home. Maybe for you what's hard is losing weight or drinking less... but sometimes we're ready to move on from these challenges and up-level our lives, but something surprising is holding us back. Check out this week's episode for a whole new way to look at overcoming your challenges.  Finding your invisible cape means electing yourself the official representative who is going to break the trend... for the sake of yourself, and for others who need someone to look to. Those around you might be struggling with peer pressure or negative thinking, but you can be the example of what it's like to live life without that particular struggle. Sometimes we don our invisible capes to allow ourselves to buy a more modest home or post less about our fantastic marriages, so that we aren't putting pressure on those around us who might be struggling.  This is not only super fun to do, but it can allow us to get the motivation to make the decision we really felt was best for us in the first place.

On this day in 1964, 27-year-old Peter Egan, his 24-year-old wife Barbara Egan, and his 19-year-old brother Gerald Egan were murdered at a rest stop. Each family member was shot twice in the head, in what was described by investigators as a Gangland revenge killing.
This week's episode is truly special. When Noah and I sat down to discuss who would be our absolute dream podcast guests, Alison Armstrong topped the list. Her work has been transformative for hundreds of men and women, as she takes the most confusing and frustrating differences between us and makes them crystal clear with humor, compassion, and her characteristic charm. For this episode, I got on the call with the intention of bringing her work into the realm of the newly married... those couples who are just getting to know each other, maybe building families and careers while they're at it. Alison was so wonderfully generous with her knowledge. The episode is divided into two parts, for several reasons. Mainly, I wanted to give you all the best opportunity to digest and try some of these ideas. So if you aren't subscribed yet, make sure to do that right away and you'll get the second part next Sunday when it is released. Alison Armstrong is the co-founder of PAX programs, author of The Queen’s Code book, Understand Men Online Course, and many more programs and workshops. You can find out much more at Alison’s Website: www.understandmen.com and learn about her upcoming LIVE event called LUX here: https://www.understandmen.com/worldevent/lux/ This is what we discussed in this week’s episode:   What exactly is Frog Farming?  How we just need to get out of the way.  What causes men to misbehave?  What should we do if our husbands are working too much?  The surprising statistic about men in the first year of fatherhood.  Why our plans for others never work.   How to survive our husband’s early career intensity.   How playfulness and affection feed our relationships.   How young mothers can incorporate self-care.   Why we aren’t getting what we need, and what to do about it.  Let me know what you took from this episode! I can’t wait to hear your wins and celebrate with you!

Today's guest is Liz Warner, a 29 year old woman with a major mission. Liz has challenged herself to complete 30 Marathons before she turns 30 in June 2020, but not only that - she created this mission: Run to Reach. Running the Marathons in different locations across the World and raising money for local charities, supporting women-focussed NGO's in each of the countries. In her words she's "Helping locally by running globally." Liz does not class herself as  fast runner, and her purpose and her #WhyIRun is far more profound than chasing times and PB's, striving for calm: for a peaceful flow of mind, Liz states "it's far more than putting one foot in front of the other." By the end of the mission Liz will have completed marathons in 30 different locations including Western Sahara, Guatemala, Mongolia, Sierra Leone, Chile, and Antarctica, When Liz Thought up this idea and challenge - she was on her honeymoon, and hoped to continue working freelance to fit in with the project. Liz has since had to take time out of work as the mission has required her time and dedication. Despite completing 14 Marathons this year and travelling across the world, and to some remote and less developed countries and areas of the world, the hardest and most demanding part of the project for Liz has been the administrative side of this mission; the work required to liaising with all 20 different NGO's and organising flights, accommodation and everything that goes with the logistics required to support this mission and make it possible. If you aren’t convinced yet to support Liz and her mission and her goal of raising $100,000 - then please listen to Liz’ story;  what motivates and inspires her. Towards the end of the show I ask her for three pieces of advice to give to others to take away in life - something that we should all listen to. And remember you can say YES to a crazy idea, you will never know where it may take you in life.  Links Liz Warner https://www.instagram.com/runtoreach/ http://runtoreach.com/about/ To donate: https://fundly.com/runtoreach https://www.facebook.com/runtoreach/  Natalie - Not Another Runner Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/notanotherrunner/ Blog: https://notanotherrunner.home.blog/

In 2014, I self-published my first article on Medium that to this day I think remains a solid introduction to UBI. Up until this article, I'd been reading a lot about UBI and engaging in a lot of discussion on Reddit about UBI, but this was my first attempt at "giving back" to the discussion with my own thoughts. It did quite well, getting over 100,000 views and because of its success, I was inspired to keep writing new articles, following it up next with my article about UBI and inflation which was even more widely read and shared. In this first article though you can see a lot of Andrew Yang's UBI: $1,000 per month basic income, 10% VAT, financial transaction taxes, carbon taxes, but most historically, it was this article where I first coined that basic income is not left or right, it's forward. It's because of that I think this particular article may just make it into the history books, seeing that it has gone on to become a central message of Andrew Yang's presidential campaign that is strongly resonating with a growing number of people. Read my article on Medium: https://medium.com/working-life/why-should-we-support-the-idea-of-an-unconditional-basic-income-8a2680c73dd3 For more info about UBI, please refer to my UBI FAQ: http://scottsantens.com/basic-income-faq You can support these podcasts through Anchor or Patreon: https://patreon.com/scottsantens  ---   Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scottsantens/support

Traveling together… there is so much to say and I hope we’re able to come back to this topic more over the course of this podcast. Is this a vacation or a family trip? If it’s a family trip, who is being prioritized? If it’s your spouse, what does your husband need to be supported and what will you need to be able to give that support?  What might come up? What is the goal of the trip? Asking your brain the right questions can take any trip and evolve it to deliver far more value to your life and your marriage. If you have an upcoming vacation with your spouse, listen to this one now and maybe even once more before you leave. Enjoy!

ANNOUNCEMENT - this is the last week to sign up for the Kallah Cohort! You can do that here.  Today it’s time to talk about letting go of your marriage. Not the one you’re in. I mean the one you thought you’d be in. You’ve been married a few months, maybe a year. The cracks are starting to show. This is NOT what you had in mind. This is not what your friends said it was like, or how it looks when you see other couples. This is not what you thought it would feel like. And when I encourage you to let go of all that, you think it’s sad. It’s devastating, really. But that’s not how I see it as your coach. In this week’s podcast, I’m going to tell you why you REALLY need to let go of your fantasy marriage.

This episode is inspired by a quote from Elizabeth Gilbert's amazing book, Big Magic. The book is about creativity, but of course we're going to be applying it to our marriages here.

This is such a great illustration of the change that I've seen in my marriage and my clients' marriages. The motion. The momentum. Our relationships have momentum. This week I'm going to give you four strategies for keeping a healthy, forward momentum in your marriage and keep you out of gridlock.

On episode 79 show I had the honor to sit down with one of the most influential people in the world of physical therapy – Shirley Sahrmann. Years ago, the physical therapy world was very much so a manual based treatment profession with very little skill in exercise. Shirley’s work over the past 6 decades has changed all this. She is credited with being one of the leaders in establishing the physical therapy profession as experts in the diagnosis and treatment of injuries through evaluation of movement (something called the movement system). This gives the PT a unique approach to helping athletes understand WHY injuries occur in the weight room and how to really go about fixing them the right way.

Announcement: Next week I will be having the amazing ALISON ARMSTRONG on the podcast!!! Make sure you are subscribed because it’s going to be split over two episodes and you are not going to want to miss this interview. I recorded an episode a while back called “Shame Won’t Make You a Better Wife.” Episode 8 You need to hear it again. Because I keep seeing you all using the idea of self-improvement as a way of attacking yourself and your self-worth. You are weaponizing self-control. Against yourself. How you know you’re doing it:   You are more conscious of what you’re doing wrong than what you’re doing right.   The Perfect Wife has shown up.   Your emotional reactions seem to be worse than makes sense.   You aren’t making progress.   When we are so down on ourselves and then trying to show up as the perfect wife, it’s totally inauthentic. What to do about it.    Name the shame.  Thank it for its contribution.    Consider life without shame. (Sidenote: accidental spending and kids nutrition sabbatical)    Consider that your actions may be coming from a place of fear or insecurity. Speak those out loud. See the reverse of them.    Clarify your vision as you would if you were speaking to a beloved younger friend.    Consider what you would need to believe, truly believe, to make a step towards that vision.

Simon Grace, AKA @runfatboyrun2017 has inspired me greatly over the past year. He has achieved not only his first Marathon this year at Manchester Marathon start of April, but he also went on to run London Marathon just three weeks later and then his third Marathon in Berlin this October where he achieved his goal of a sub 3:30 Marathon. Yet, when he started running towards the end of 2015 he did not enjoy it, and struggled to run a mile.  Simon has a brilliant attitude to running, training and life. Being a father of three, Simon knows too well the art of juggling work and family life with running and training. He tells us how he manages to schedule in his running and training, and he gives some great advice in this chat. Simon tells us just how he got into running, where he struggled with running less than a mile - to completing three marathons this year. He has had incredible progress within his running, progressing from a 2:00 hour half marathon - 90 minutes.  Me and Simon also chat about post race/event Blues, How Instagram can be used as a Diary, and Memory Board to help motivate us, and hold ourselves accountable, and also the importance of setting small achievable goals in order to succeed as a runner.

I was really excited for this episode. After first hearing about the Blue-zones I knew I wanted to find out more. And who better to learn off than one of the resident doctors involved with one of the Blue Zones, Loma Linda.   If you are not familiar with the Blue Zones, these are the longest living populations on the planet.  Some of which eat small amounts of meat others that eat no meat or animal products of any kind. I talk to Dr Renae about the differences the diet have on life expectancy as well as other key things the blue zone populations do to have such a long life. Not only do they live long, their quality of life is high too.   Dr Renae and I also speak about her upbringing, how to read scientific studies, her time working with Dr Greger as a moderator at nutrtionfacts.org and what else you can do to insure you have a high quality of life.  After all, if there is tens of thousands of people living over 100, would you not want to learn how to "copy" them so you can too?  Please go check her out @drrenaethomas as she is highly knowledgable, well -spoken, fun and most importantly very passionate about helping people better understand preventive medicine.

I was really excited about this episode when I recorded it, but after living with this work for a few weeks I'm convinced EVERY woman needs to hear it. Years of struggling with accepting my appearance just... over. It's a little bit advanced, but I think it will at least plant a very important seed, even for those who aren't familiar with thought work. Please listen and forward to the women in your lives, whether they are newly married or not. 
Holly and I first met at an event in London and we both knew immediately that we were on the same page with nutrition, exercise and veganism (the page that EVERYONE should be one)  We decided to do this podcast a little differently, by interviewing each other in a "you go, I go" manner.  We alternated between topics that we thought were worthy of a fun discussion and I think created a very entertaining and insightful episode.   We cover,  - How to do Veganuary Right - Tips on tackling your New Years Resolutions  - How to choose a good coach or PT - How to tackle social media's issues  - and more..  Have a listen and let us know what you think (there will definitely be a round two)

Catrin is proof that you can find time in a busy schedule, and she explains how the power of exercise is a great tool to cope with stressful, overwhelming times as well as an activity that brings joy and health benefits.

I was working with a client and she was stuck on the idea of being authentic with our feelings while at the same time taking responsibility for them and choosing what I call “helpful thoughts.” So this week we're going to talk about the difference between processing our feelings and holding onto our feelings. The easiest way is to think of it as sensations vs words. Thoughts are words (sentences, usually), and feelings are physical sensations. We read the tight shoulders and clenched stomach as anxiety or anger. Focus on what the body is experiencing. We’re told to process our emotions, not to ignore how we feel, to honor our feelings, but we need to get really clear on what that means. Going in thought circles... ruminating on that one horrible thing or that offensive thing she/he said... that's not feeling your feelings. That's just having a thought and getting really attached to it being true and having that thought over and over until you can't see your way out of it. This week I'm teaching you how to process a feeling. The deeper question I think is really, when is it a feeling and when is it intuition? If I know that I’m responsible for my feelings, does that mean I can’t ever use them to help guide me? How do I know the difference? Your intuitive sense is not urgent. It is calm and clear. It doesn’t speak to you in rules like “he shouldn’t” or accusations like, “how dare he” or desperate questions like “how can I possibly not be hurt or be happy like this?” Trust that when you quiet the screaming, loud, urgent emotions, that inner voice will certainly come up for you.

Nicole Abramowitz is certainly a qualified psychologist in terms of life experience, despite being a few months off having the piece of paper to prove it. Her story of family trauma lead her to a pursuit devoted to better understanding how the human mind works and has given her the firm belief that the biggest tragedy in life is not learning from the tragedy itself.  This episode may be triggering and I would advise those experiencing any past trauma similar to Nicole's to speak to a trained professional, and just in general because psychology is awesome.   00:00 How 2020 is a fucker so far and why it’s OK to be one of the people being strong for others, plus how I met Nicole. 04:00 Riding the sometimes shit wave that is life and the benefits of adversity.  06:00 Why people are so fucked up, the societal regressions we are experiencing that contribute to our collective poor mental health.  12:00 Nicole shares her story. (This may be triggering and contains themes of suicide and domestic abuse.) 18:00 Accepting that you can’t help anyone anymore than they can help themselves. The difficulty in accepting and providing support and the importance of autonomy and empowerment. 21:00 Toxic relationships and the addiction pathway, why we are hooked on playing the hero. 27:00 Grief and loss, death and breakups and the similarities in coping mechanisms for trauma. 35:00 There's no 'right' decision, you make a decision and you make it work. The importance of owning this is in a life of infinite possibilities.  42:00 The importance of values.  52:00 Takeaway strategies when supporting a loved one - accepting that it's not about you and why we find this so fucking hard.  60:00 Why adaption is the most important trait in survival.  64:00 Inner contentment and not being motivated by external reward. 68:00 Gratitude, perspective and acceptance...not letting your struggles define you. 70:00 The joy of living your mundane life and why being bored kinda rules.

Part 1. [Links Available Below] Lizzie Dimond, a Wife, mother of four, a drama teacher, club member of Lliswerry Runners in Newport, and I have to say a very SPEEEDY runner.  Lizzie started running in 2017, just 7 months into her running Journey and having gone through an incredibly tough time with her family, Lizzie went on to run her first Half Marathon in an incredible 1:35, despite having no time goal! Lizzie would go on to fall pregnant with her fourth child, and continue to run during her pregnancy and bounced back after the pregnancy really quickly!

This is part 1 of a hot topic for many of you ladies, and I can completely understand why. This week I'll be sharing my paradigm shifts that have saved me from years of frustration and resentment when it came to partnering on housework with my husband. I'm sharing how we can use thought work (a la Brooke Castillo) on our house work (see what I did there?) and also some powerful insights from the research of Alison Armstrong. I highly recommend Alison's two books as a great starting point for her research. They are written as fiction so they are an easy and fun read, but packed full of information.  Keys to the Kingdom - How men change over time and why it's so confusing. The Queen's Code - How we can bring out the best in men (and often bring out the worst) Episode 12 - Mind Management - For an introduction to thought work

Grab a beer, a glass of wine, or a cocktail, and sit back and let me tell you even more about the fascinating people who are the ancient Sumerians.

In episode 71. Dr. Aaron Horschig goes in depth into the factors that create shoulder pain when lifting (anatomy, mobility, stability & biomechanics). If you would like to learn more about screening the shoulder to uncover your individual weak link that may have led to your pain, check out this blog article: https://squatuniversity.com/2018/08/04/how-to-screen-your-shoulder-pain/ To the question ‘what causes shoulder pain?’ The simplest answer is that pain is often the result of excessive stress or strain on the small structures that surround the shoulder joint. The normally harmonious shoulder complex can be derailed by one part malfunctioning (i.e. weak rotator cuff, poor passive shoulder stability). For the strength athlete, these forces are usually the result of cumulative micro-trauma due to three things: 1) Imbalances between the prime movers and prime stabilizers 2) Instability 3) Poor movement and lifting technique Big thank you to my sponsor Gainz Box!

When we need a boost, when we need reassurance, when we have to take a step towards something that scares us, how do we move through fear? How do we move past all of the thoughts in our mind telling us to "run", "stop", "do what you know", etc.? You feel in your body first and let the thoughts in your mind move to the side. Take that leap. There is commentary at the end of this meditation to help break down the symbolism.

We may not like to admit it, but we tend to have some opinions about our husbands. Whether he's too messy, bad with money, or not taking his job seriously enough (or too seriously!), it's very common to forget that these are only our opinions and not a true fact. In this episode I'm going to teach you how to coach yourself when you are getting frustrated with your husband.

Jesus, Our Lord, Saint Medard served as a bishop during very difficult times, and his long life of spiritual leadership created a tremendous impression on the people. Because of his patronage against difficult times and bad weather, we ask him to intercede for us during the storms of our lives as well as the storms in nature. Protect us and our homes. And Lord, help the victims of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Send in more helpers and multiply the supplies that are needed for their aid. You calmed the storm on the Sea of Galilee; deliver us from the storms that are raging around us now. Saint Medard, pray for us.  Lord, have mercy on us all and protect us from harm. Jesus, we TRUST in YOU! Amen.

"Anxiety is a form of fear, ...Fear can express itself as anger. If you look at anger closely, you will find hidden underneath it is a state of fear." "Is it possible that certain thoughts that you think frequently produce the fear? Is it possible that you project yourself into the future moment excessively, trying to control something you have no control over?” Eckhart Tolle further goes on to say that excessive thought activity often creates scenarios of things going wrong; that are not happening now; may never happen. And even if they did happen, the actual situation would be easier to face. Tolle also educates his audience by sharing nuggets like, “There’s nothing you can do to remedy an imaginary situation except to stop thinking it. But, if an actual situation arises, you face it and you give it your attention and you take the action that you need to take”. Your life is yours to own! No one can live it for you.

This week I'm taking your questions about sharing your FEELINGS with your husband!  Question #1: HOW do I share my feelings with my husband, and how do I create a relationship where we can do that? Answer: First of all, STOP and be absolutely sure that you aren't sharing your feelings in an effort to change him! We always want to be responsible for our OWN feelings, so you must stop and do some thought work and figure this out. Sharing your feelings so that he'll change is, essentially, manipulation, which of course none of us want to do. (If you need support on the thought work piece, go to www.firstyearmarried.com and watch video #1 of my course!)  Question #2: How do you separate frustrations in a conversation and say it in a way that your spouse can understand the REASONS for your frustration? Answer: If your frustration is with him, you want to start by taking care of your own emotional well-being (see above).  "As long as he's responsible for how you're feeling, you're really limited." Beyond that, sometimes we need to actually plan out a conversation with our husband. Let's say your life is set up in a way that you're not getting enough sleep. First, work on the resentment piece. Then you can come to the conversation with openness and belief that the two of you can find a solution. To hear my interviews with Alison Armstrong where we talked about our husbands' problem-solving abilities, go here.  Question #3: What do I do about a husband who can't access his own feelings and frustration? Answer: Focus on your lane. His feelings and thoughts are HIS lane, not yours. So question how YOU want to show up in this situation. What's your story about how he's acting? Why is it a problem? Actually get this down on paper.  Question #4: If something bothers you about how your spouse deals with disciplining the kids, how do you communicate that? Answer: Women often have more experience with kids coming into a marriage, so we often see ourselves as the authority. So first of all, go back to the business partner model. Is it possible this highly respected partner might have another good idea? Possibly even a better idea? Could I maybe be wrong about this? He's different from you by design.  Question #5: I always hear about your feelings are not your thoughts and the other way around, but how do we work on internalizing this? Answer: There's a difference between processing a feeling and just thinking a thought over and over. This is described clearly in Episode 58, "When You Can't Get Over It."  Question #6: I'd love to get help with first identifying the feelings--like, what am I even feeling right now? Answer: It's just a vocabulary problem. You can literally Google "list of feelings" or "synonyms for sad." It is helpful, but don't worry about not being there yet.

The horror show that is our conditional welfare system remains unknown to most everyone. In 1993, Theresa Funiciello wrote a Pulitzer-nominated book to try to help change that by laying bare the details she learned as a welfare mother herself, and as someone who worked at an organization devoted to helping people in the welfare system, and as someone who even became Special Assistant to the Commissioner of New York State's Department of Social Services. Her book is considered to be one of the most important books on welfare and poverty in America to ever be published, and it concludes with a call for unconditional basic income as the only solution to fix what's broken. This episode I devote the hour to reading the first chapter in the hope listeners will better understand why it's so important to replace welfare as we know it with UBI.

What's the one thing you can do to transform the dynamic of your relationship? Start asking for what you want. Sound easy? It's not. For most of us, even identifying what we want is hard--it's not the things we're nagging him about, it's the deeper, more meaningful things that would truly light us up. It's the things we can't do on our own or get for ourselves--and it's so hard sometimes to admit that there's a limit to our independence.

 Sometimes all the coaching in the world isn't going to cut it. And that's because you're just too tired. When I was first married, I loved staying up late... but my marriage was paying the price. It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that the zombie my husband was married to wasn't the one he signed up for!  In this episode, I'll walk you through my system called "baseline self care" that will allow you to identify what keeps you up and running. This isn't the deep meaningful spiritual retreat or even wine and bubble baths. This is just about having clarity about what's on your list that needs to be done, at a minimum. I'll also teach you my ten second check-in and help you identify when it's time for self-coaching and when it's time for self care.

In episode 68, Dr. Aaron Horschig breaks down why you shouldn't place your complete trust in MRI results for low back pain. Research has estimated that almost a third of healthy pain free 20-year-olds currently have a disc bulge in their spine! (Brinjikji W, Luetmer PH, Comstock B, et al. Systematic literature review of imaging features of spinal degeneration in asymptomatic populations. Am J Neuroradiol. 2015;36:811-16) This number increases 10% every decade, meaning 45-50% of people between the ages of 40-50 have a disc bulge but with no back pain at all. It is highly likely to have abnormal scary findings on the MRI if you’re above the age of 60 but many of these individuals have no low back pain at all. Can a disc bulge create back pain? Sure. But just because there is one that is picked up on an MRI does NOT necessarily mean it is the root cause of your pain. Check out these referenced articles:    Jensen MC, Brant-Zawadzki MN, Obuchowski N, et al. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in people without back pain. N Engl J Med. 1994;331(2):69-73  Carragee E, Alamin T, Cheng I, et al. Are first-time episodes of serious LBP associated with new MRI findings? Spine J. 2006; 6(6):624-35   Fukuda K & Kawakami G.

Kate Strauss is a self-published poet whose book DASH-Y can be found on Amazon for purchase.

Find her book at:  https://www.amazon.com/DASH-Y-Kate-Strauss-ebook/dp/B079TYQHS7 Instagram: @katestrausspoetry Pieces shared from DASH-Y: #30 : Kate talks about the themes in this piece, including not allowing ourselves to be used, which is a difficult lesson to learn. “We’re meant to cherish our bodies” is an untitled piece on her Instagram page that deals with loving our imperfections- something we're often taught the opposite of in life and society.  #23: Needing more intimately is more easily understood when it comes from a man, but as women we need these things just as intensely. “Pain is the touchstone to recovery.” Kate went on to describe her experience getting sober: “It’s really freeing to do a lot of the things that I thought I couldn’t do sober. It’s freeing to dance sober. It’s freeing to have deep conversations sober, and you remember them. And it’s really freeing to do all this stuff, stand up in front of crowds, do stupid things and think that you could never do those things because you had to have a drink to do them, and you don’t have to.” -Kate Strauss  Original music by artist RJ Wayne, AKA Philasifer, featuring his track "That Magic."

Do you have an image of your mind of how you wish you were showing up in your marriage? Do you come down hard on yourself when you don't? If so, you MUST listen to this week's podcast. You CAN be a better wife (or husband), but beating yourself up or criticizing yourself is not the way to do it. More than that... you'll actually harm the authenticity of your relationship. Your partner chose YOU, flaws and all. This podcast will teach you how to align your thinking with the result you want in your marriage. 
We start in the depths of a cave. In this cave thoughts and desires of what we need start to come from our heart and mind in an attempt to bring us that emotional need that we long for.  
This week I’m sharing a hack that I learned while researching how to best care for myself as a type 1 diabetic. While it was intended to help with things like glucose control, I think this hack can help all of us on most long-term goals. Adam Brown, writer for diaTribe, writes in his book Bright Spots and Land Mines* about the benefits of setting specific, short-term goals to help us achieve our long term goals. Want better overall health? Think about how your mood will improve in the next few hours when you exercise. So here’s the hack du jour: ask yourself, what makes you feel better TODAY? -Exercise: long term “numbers” or how I feel? -Food: weight loss, or how I’ll be able to focus the rest of the day? -Laundry: is it about you and your abilities to be organized or can you just think about how nice it is to go to bed knowing it’s done? -Investing in your marriage (why don’t I talk about this more??): is it about working towards a long, happy marriage, or just the nice feeling of being an awesome wife? So here’s the strategy:   Identify the long-term goal   Identify the short-term gain   Then… take a pic and tag me! @firstyearmarried or send to kayla@firstyearmarried.com Have an awesome week!  *affiliate link

I was looking through some of the requests that I’ve received for topics to cover and I wanted to address the one that would give us the biggest room for growth, the most potential. And so this question “how do I get out of victim mentality?” really stuck out to me. Because as long as we see ourselves as a victim, we are BY DEFINITION powerless. Before we go further: November 10 is the first call of our Kallah Cohort, a specific LIVE First Year Married course for women in the Orthodox Jewish community! The first class is free and no-obligation, but you need to sign up to get a spot! See you there! An important note about this whole episode: this material, like all of my material, does NOT apply to unhealthy or abusive relationships. We all have ups and downs--as individuals and in our marriages--but I encourage anyone who is unsure if their relationship is abusive or dysfunctional to seek out a qualified couples therapist. Here is one great resource. We all fall into victim mentality sometimes, whether it’s a story about our relationship or our abilities at work or with our physical health or self-discipline… Here are seven steps to help you leave victim mode behind.   Identify the feeling.  Knowing the feeling, viscerally, will help you “red flag” it for the future. How does it feel in your body? What are your habitual thoughts? What’s the story? Anything with a story is optional.   Beware of boundaries set to control. If you are frustrated that you set a boundary and it wasn’t followed, you didn’t set a boundary you just told someone what to do and they didn’t do it. Listen to learn how to set boundaries that don't leave you in victim-mode.    Articulate the thought. You guys getting used to me saying this? You can’t question a thought until you articulate it. So what’s the story? “I’m not the happily-ever-after type.” So write it down. Look at it. Feel it. Be with it. Don’t be in such a rush to get rid of it. What we tend to do is we half-articulate it then we try to jump to another thought so fast because this one is so painful. Don’t be in a rush. It’s not urgent, it’s just feelings.    Notice the results of your thought. Here’s where we want to focus on the present instead of, as is a natural tendency, to go past-focused. It’s interesting to question where your story came from. You for sure have reasons for why it’s true. But right now just look at WHAT THE THOUGHT IS DOING. How does it make you feel? What kinds of things are you capable of with this thought? What aren’t you?    Live with your thought. Now that you’ve gone scientific and cerebral, gather some field research on how it’s playing out for you. Watch it in action. Write it down or send a voice memo to your podcast buddy if you have one (if not, time to get one!)    Now you can start to jiggle it loose. How is the opposite true? How do you always get happily-ever-after? (Going into the holidays feeling so low from everything that happened with my health this year… then realized the opposite is equally true.)    Advanced skill: Go all-out play and pick a new amazing thought! This ONLY works if you’ve really spent time in your current thought, with awareness and mindfulness!   Thanks so much for the question and I look forward to seeing you back here next week! In the meantime, have you checked out my FREE class at FirstYearMarried.com? Well, here it is!

This week I have Simone Sobel, an Atlanta-based couples counselor and trauma therapist on, to discuss some important and common questions about couples therapy:   When is it time to go see a couples therapist?  What red flags do newlyweds need to know about that may indicate that their husband might have a personality disorder or they may be in an abusive relationship?   How to find a good couples therapist?   What to expect when you go to a couples therapist?   Is it ever too late for couples therapy?   How to know if couples therapy is working?  How do you decide who to go to between a therapist, a coach, or a mentor or religious advisor? Simone says that marriage classes and coaching are a great foundation for any couple, teaching psycho-educational tools that are beneficial to everyone, even if they’ve been married a long time. When is it time to go see a couples therapist? There are lots of common reasons that couples come to couples therapy. Communication is very poor (ie, they can never get on the same page about a certain issue, or there is stonewalling, chronic defensiveness, hyper-criticism, etc.) Breach of trust in the marriage (ex, one partner spending a lot of money in secret or looking at pornography) Devestating or dificult life events (losing a job, health crisis, loss of a child or parent) Lifecycle change (retirement, new baby, empty nest, a major move) Negative cycles that aren’t going away and you need outside help. Fine tuning a good relationship (no, there don’t have to be major issues to go to a therapist!) Spiritual mentors can be very helpful for spiritual based issues, and often they give very good guidance and advice. If you find you are going again and again to your priest, rabbi, etc., and aren’t making progress, that would be a time to consider a therapist. What are some red flags that your husband may have a psychological or personality issue or disorder? If a woman feels consistantly criticized and put down in a way that makes him/her feel insecure, demaned, or shamed. Ongoing provocation, even with a calm or apologetic period between cycles, are considered a cycle of abuse. If your husband is trying to isolate you from your friends, this is a red flag. If your spouse can never take responsibility for an issue, this is also a red flag. Kayla’s note: friends are not the best place to “diagnose” your husband. A therapist will be able to distinguish between normal human misbehavior and serious dysfunction or abuse. Simone: Find one person to speak with, more of a mentor, who is supportive. A coach or therapist can be neutral and non-judgemental. Couples can get into negative cycles and say mean things to each other, but it’s not necessarily abusive.

It’s been a little while since my last podcast, but I’m back and I’ve got a special episode for you today, particularly for those looking to build a significant home staging business, and I’m talking a million dollar revenue business. And I don’t think there are many of those in the Australian home staging industry, so if that’s your ambition, listen closely.   And if it’s not, you’ll still get a lot out of this chat. It’s actually my first guest from outside Australia so the podcast is going international! It’s Melissa Marro from Rave Home Staging, based in Jacksonville, Florida. Melissa move to Jacksonville and started Rave Home Staging completely from scratch about six years ago. Some of the things we covered: - How Melissa thinks about marketing, and her focus on putting out educational content - How Melissa has changed her pricing structure (to something I’ve not seen in Australia) to ensure that the price is never an objection from a client again - Where other home stagers are going wrong by using what Melissa calls ‘pretty talk’ - The one thing she’d change in her business if she could. You can follow Melissa’s journey via:   Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ravehomestaging/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ravehomestaging/   Website: http://rave-reviews-home-staging.com/   YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbDocMcCrwgUZfHGK8qtCg
