 Sometimes all the coaching in the world isn't going to cut it. And that's because you're just too tired. When I was first married, I loved staying up late... but my marriage was paying the price. It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that the zombie my husband was married to wasn't the one he signed up for!  In this episode, I'll walk you through my system called "baseline self care" that will allow you to identify what keeps you up and running. This isn't the deep meaningful spiritual retreat or even wine and bubble baths. This is just about having clarity about what's on your list that needs to be done, at a minimum. I'll also teach you my ten second check-in and help you identify when it's time for self-coaching and when it's time for self care.

In episode 68, Dr. Aaron Horschig breaks down why you shouldn't place your complete trust in MRI results for low back pain. Research has estimated that almost a third of healthy pain free 20-year-olds currently have a disc bulge in their spine! (Brinjikji W, Luetmer PH, Comstock B, et al. Systematic literature review of imaging features of spinal degeneration in asymptomatic populations. Am J Neuroradiol. 2015;36:811-16) This number increases 10% every decade, meaning 45-50% of people between the ages of 40-50 have a disc bulge but with no back pain at all. It is highly likely to have abnormal scary findings on the MRI if you’re above the age of 60 but many of these individuals have no low back pain at all. Can a disc bulge create back pain? Sure. But just because there is one that is picked up on an MRI does NOT necessarily mean it is the root cause of your pain. Check out these referenced articles:    Jensen MC, Brant-Zawadzki MN, Obuchowski N, et al. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in people without back pain. N Engl J Med. 1994;331(2):69-73  Carragee E, Alamin T, Cheng I, et al. Are first-time episodes of serious LBP associated with new MRI findings? Spine J. 2006; 6(6):624-35   Fukuda K & Kawakami G.

Kate Strauss is a self-published poet whose book DASH-Y can be found on Amazon for purchase.

Find her book at:  https://www.amazon.com/DASH-Y-Kate-Strauss-ebook/dp/B079TYQHS7 Instagram: @katestrausspoetry Pieces shared from DASH-Y: #30 : Kate talks about the themes in this piece, including not allowing ourselves to be used, which is a difficult lesson to learn. “We’re meant to cherish our bodies” is an untitled piece on her Instagram page that deals with loving our imperfections- something we're often taught the opposite of in life and society.  #23: Needing more intimately is more easily understood when it comes from a man, but as women we need these things just as intensely. “Pain is the touchstone to recovery.” Kate went on to describe her experience getting sober: “It’s really freeing to do a lot of the things that I thought I couldn’t do sober. It’s freeing to dance sober. It’s freeing to have deep conversations sober, and you remember them. And it’s really freeing to do all this stuff, stand up in front of crowds, do stupid things and think that you could never do those things because you had to have a drink to do them, and you don’t have to.” -Kate Strauss  Original music by artist RJ Wayne, AKA Philasifer, featuring his track "That Magic."

We start in the depths of a cave. In this cave thoughts and desires of what we need start to come from our heart and mind in an attempt to bring us that emotional need that we long for.  
This week I’m sharing a hack that I learned while researching how to best care for myself as a type 1 diabetic. While it was intended to help with things like glucose control, I think this hack can help all of us on most long-term goals. Adam Brown, writer for diaTribe, writes in his book Bright Spots and Land Mines* about the benefits of setting specific, short-term goals to help us achieve our long term goals. Want better overall health? Think about how your mood will improve in the next few hours when you exercise. So here’s the hack du jour: ask yourself, what makes you feel better TODAY? -Exercise: long term “numbers” or how I feel? -Food: weight loss, or how I’ll be able to focus the rest of the day? -Laundry: is it about you and your abilities to be organized or can you just think about how nice it is to go to bed knowing it’s done? -Investing in your marriage (why don’t I talk about this more??): is it about working towards a long, happy marriage, or just the nice feeling of being an awesome wife? So here’s the strategy:   Identify the long-term goal   Identify the short-term gain   Then… take a pic and tag me! @firstyearmarried or send to kayla@firstyearmarried.com Have an awesome week!  *affiliate link

As soon as the ladies arrived in the Hamptons, Margret and Teresa got straight into it. Luckily, they pair had a minor make up session that led to them at least being able to tolerate each other. The ones who can't tolerate each other now? Jennifer and Jackie after Jennifer makes a comment about Jackie being "cheap" with her money for her kids. A major blow up leaked over to Jennifer throwing silverware at Melissa and it all goes downhill from there.

I was looking through some of the requests that I’ve received for topics to cover and I wanted to address the one that would give us the biggest room for growth, the most potential. And so this question “how do I get out of victim mentality?” really stuck out to me. Because as long as we see ourselves as a victim, we are BY DEFINITION powerless. Before we go further: November 10 is the first call of our Kallah Cohort, a specific LIVE First Year Married course for women in the Orthodox Jewish community! The first class is free and no-obligation, but you need to sign up to get a spot! See you there! An important note about this whole episode: this material, like all of my material, does NOT apply to unhealthy or abusive relationships. We all have ups and downs--as individuals and in our marriages--but I encourage anyone who is unsure if their relationship is abusive or dysfunctional to seek out a qualified couples therapist. Here is one great resource. We all fall into victim mentality sometimes, whether it’s a story about our relationship or our abilities at work or with our physical health or self-discipline… Here are seven steps to help you leave victim mode behind.   Identify the feeling.  Knowing the feeling, viscerally, will help you “red flag” it for the future. How does it feel in your body? What are your habitual thoughts? What’s the story? Anything with a story is optional.   Beware of boundaries set to control. If you are frustrated that you set a boundary and it wasn’t followed, you didn’t set a boundary you just told someone what to do and they didn’t do it. Listen to learn how to set boundaries that don't leave you in victim-mode.    Articulate the thought. You guys getting used to me saying this? You can’t question a thought until you articulate it. So what’s the story? “I’m not the happily-ever-after type.” So write it down. Look at it. Feel it. Be with it. Don’t be in such a rush to get rid of it. What we tend to do is we half-articulate it then we try to jump to another thought so fast because this one is so painful. Don’t be in a rush. It’s not urgent, it’s just feelings.    Notice the results of your thought. Here’s where we want to focus on the present instead of, as is a natural tendency, to go past-focused. It’s interesting to question where your story came from. You for sure have reasons for why it’s true. But right now just look at WHAT THE THOUGHT IS DOING. How does it make you feel? What kinds of things are you capable of with this thought? What aren’t you?    Live with your thought. Now that you’ve gone scientific and cerebral, gather some field research on how it’s playing out for you. Watch it in action. Write it down or send a voice memo to your podcast buddy if you have one (if not, time to get one!)    Now you can start to jiggle it loose. How is the opposite true? How do you always get happily-ever-after? (Going into the holidays feeling so low from everything that happened with my health this year… then realized the opposite is equally true.)    Advanced skill: Go all-out play and pick a new amazing thought! This ONLY works if you’ve really spent time in your current thought, with awareness and mindfulness!   Thanks so much for the question and I look forward to seeing you back here next week! In the meantime, have you checked out my FREE class at FirstYearMarried.com? Well, here it is!

This week I have Simone Sobel, an Atlanta-based couples counselor and trauma therapist on, to discuss some important and common questions about couples therapy:   When is it time to go see a couples therapist?  What red flags do newlyweds need to know about that may indicate that their husband might have a personality disorder or they may be in an abusive relationship?   How to find a good couples therapist?   What to expect when you go to a couples therapist?   Is it ever too late for couples therapy?   How to know if couples therapy is working?  How do you decide who to go to between a therapist, a coach, or a mentor or religious advisor? Simone says that marriage classes and coaching are a great foundation for any couple, teaching psycho-educational tools that are beneficial to everyone, even if they’ve been married a long time. When is it time to go see a couples therapist? There are lots of common reasons that couples come to couples therapy. Communication is very poor (ie, they can never get on the same page about a certain issue, or there is stonewalling, chronic defensiveness, hyper-criticism, etc.) Breach of trust in the marriage (ex, one partner spending a lot of money in secret or looking at pornography) Devestating or dificult life events (losing a job, health crisis, loss of a child or parent) Lifecycle change (retirement, new baby, empty nest, a major move) Negative cycles that aren’t going away and you need outside help. Fine tuning a good relationship (no, there don’t have to be major issues to go to a therapist!) Spiritual mentors can be very helpful for spiritual based issues, and often they give very good guidance and advice. If you find you are going again and again to your priest, rabbi, etc., and aren’t making progress, that would be a time to consider a therapist. What are some red flags that your husband may have a psychological or personality issue or disorder? If a woman feels consistantly criticized and put down in a way that makes him/her feel insecure, demaned, or shamed. Ongoing provocation, even with a calm or apologetic period between cycles, are considered a cycle of abuse. If your husband is trying to isolate you from your friends, this is a red flag. If your spouse can never take responsibility for an issue, this is also a red flag. Kayla’s note: friends are not the best place to “diagnose” your husband. A therapist will be able to distinguish between normal human misbehavior and serious dysfunction or abuse. Simone: Find one person to speak with, more of a mentor, who is supportive. A coach or therapist can be neutral and non-judgemental. Couples can get into negative cycles and say mean things to each other, but it’s not necessarily abusive.

It’s been a little while since my last podcast, but I’m back and I’ve got a special episode for you today, particularly for those looking to build a significant home staging business, and I’m talking a million dollar revenue business. And I don’t think there are many of those in the Australian home staging industry, so if that’s your ambition, listen closely.   And if it’s not, you’ll still get a lot out of this chat. It’s actually my first guest from outside Australia so the podcast is going international! It’s Melissa Marro from Rave Home Staging, based in Jacksonville, Florida. Melissa move to Jacksonville and started Rave Home Staging completely from scratch about six years ago. Some of the things we covered: - How Melissa thinks about marketing, and her focus on putting out educational content - How Melissa has changed her pricing structure (to something I’ve not seen in Australia) to ensure that the price is never an objection from a client again - Where other home stagers are going wrong by using what Melissa calls ‘pretty talk’ - The one thing she’d change in her business if she could. You can follow Melissa’s journey via:   Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ravehomestaging/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ravehomestaging/   Website: http://rave-reviews-home-staging.com/   YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbDocMcCrwgUZfHGK8qtCg  
In our podcast, we cover the most important topics relevant to embracing a vegan lifestyle, from common challenges on what to eat and how to stay healthy to how to deal with your friends, family, and other people in your environment. 
On this day in 1934, Tony Mancini began his trial for the Brighton Trunk murders. But the crime itself was bound to another, eerily similar murder.
On this day in 1978, writer and broadcaster Georgi Markov died of blood poisoning, four days after being implanted with a poisonous device from an umbrella.
